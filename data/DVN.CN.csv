2 months ago,Not enough investors know about this Company yet, I don‚Äôt even think most people realize that the price tags their looking at in most stores are digital now. They look just like regular price tags but the businesses that are now using them are saving a lot of time and money. A company like DVN.CN stands to make a lot of money down the road. As an investor  in Danavation Technologies I‚Äôm excited today knowing that they‚Äôve secured DTC Eligibility in the U.S. I‚Äôm so tempted to start mentioning this ticker when I‚Äôm on one of my other investment boards. There‚Äôs plenty info on what this company does and how micro e- labeling and this technology can benefit industries. Would like to see some revenue numbers , but I do think this is a promising investment. GLTA!More,james,,0,0

3 months ago,For me I stumbled across this company shortly after walking into my local No thrills and realizing the labels in from of me were all digital. I did some research and that‚Äôs how I found out about this Canadian company ‚ÄúDanavation Technologies Corp‚Äù. Now I can‚Äôt help but see these Micro e-paper displays popping up in all the local super market stores across all the stores in my area. Zehrs has them, Shopper‚Äôs, LCBO etc. Now this is something that‚Äôs happening ‚Äúnow‚Äù and it‚Äôs happening quite rapidly right under the noses of most investors. We‚Äôre witnessing the beginning of for all intensive purposes the adoption of paperless digital labeling systems across all facets of food chain, big box companies and retailers across North America. For a little company with a market cap of only 32 million CDN and a share price of only $.30 cents I can see this company and its investors well on its way to seeing exponential growth and earnings in the foreseeable future. Lately I‚Äôve noticed an increase in volume and interest towards DVN.CN. As it stands, I don‚Äôt have a very large investment in Danavation and after a couple months I‚Äôm still pretty much even, but I see that changing as more and more people and certainly investors realize that the price tag that‚Äôs in front of them is no longer made from paper or other wasted resources. Money, time and manpower no longer has to be wasted as well and logistics such as price changes, sales and audits can now be done in mere minutes as a posed to hours, days or weeks. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going be too much longer before investors find this little  company and realize just how much potential this has. GLTA!More,james,,5,0

4 months ago,Found out about DVN.CN about a month ago after realizing that my local NoThrills was using digital price tags. I would have never know had I have not been there 5 minutes before closing as they were updating prices. Watching as all the tags rescinded to zero and then back to their individual prices I thought?. Wholly #$%$!, when did they do this?and what a great idea!. I needed to find out more, so after poking around a bit I found out which companies are responsible for this and came across Danavation Technologies. Might of been a little too hasty in buying shares the very next day, but sometimes you just act out of spontaneous conviction or instinctively. Most people aren?t even aware of this company yet, more and more stores are starting to adopt micro e-paper displays because updates can be made right from corporate office and in real time. This is crazy efficient when you think about large store chains that can do this across all their stores at the same time. DVN.CN has targeted several markets in Grocery, retail, Healthcare, Warehousing/Distribution, Military Supply chain, Animal Services and Shelters, Automotive, Hardware and LCBO. Danavation is a software company showing what it can do through Hardware applications. There?s many reasons why Companies are turning towards Micro E- paperless displays. Aside from the obvious paper waste and the labour intensiveness of organizing teams that have to maintain competitive pricing changes, and relabeling. With this Covid crisis it?s not about maintaining labor?.,there?s no labour to maintain.  Their struggling to find people to keep up with price fluctuations and re labeling. DVN.CN Provides it?s customers with the power to maintain these margins and stay competitive. Danavation?s CEO in an interview today said that one of Canada?s largest Retailers in Grocery are launching the software that the developed for them on February 9th or 10th and that the market opportunity is enormous!. That?s enough for me, if anyone wants to check this company out, there?s been some recent interviews like the one today February 3rd 2022 and a lot big  things happening with the LCBO, Ace Hardware and within big box and grocery chains.

5 months ago,Walked into my local No thrills the other night before closing, reached for a can of tuna just as they were updating their prices. Had no idea they were all digital now and it blew my mind. Thought I having a stoke or something! Lol, They look just like the standard black and white price tag?s they?ve always used?, the only thing that gives them away are the little sensors on both ends. That freaked me right out because years ago I remember thinking that one day stores will do something like this and here it was ?. Right in front me!. As an investor all I wanted to do after that was find out which companies were involved with this technology, what it?s called and how it works. You know what?, most people I?ve talked to had no clue this was actually happening and being incorporated in our local liquor stores, pharmacy or big box stores etc. this is really only just getting started and adopted by stores and businesses. That?s how I found out about Danavation ( DVN.CN ) I did some searching around on internet and here I am ? excited. Isn?t technology amazing!, we?re pretty much at the point now where anything?s possible, all you need is a keen imagination, determination, a great team and a #$%$ load of money backing you! So here I am, bought me a few thousand shares, enough to make a lot of money once investors realize like I did that this technology and labeling system is now being used in our grocery stores and businesses. Not enough money that I?m gonna be worrying about losing either. Myself?.I?m pretty amazed by all this. The thought of all the time and money this will save companies and small business. The thought of where this can lead us as far as advertising and saving on coupons and waste is amazing. This really feels like a ground floor opportunity at .38 cents a share for this Canadian public dual listed company. I feel like I?ve stumbled on this one early,  maybe too early but we?ll see!, This reminds me a little bit of VSBLTY and that I started buying at .17 cents and check it today. These micro e-paper displays are really cool and enable companies across various sectors to automate labeling, prices, products and promotions across retailers in real time. I think I?ll keep these shares and lay low for a while, GLTA!More,james,,0,0

Low overhead costs and pays like an annuity with the sub fees if its successful in getting interest.

last year,Would be great if they could ink a deal with LCBO. But, also would be ideal for them to put out some sort of material news. We've had 3 updates but no $$$ talk.

Most of the competition is concentrated in Europe, but the United States and Canada is relatively an untapped market at the moment with a need for this product and service.Company expects to generate $20 million in sales for 2021.
