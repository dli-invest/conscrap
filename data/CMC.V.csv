2 hours ago,Something to keep in mind.... an insanely large amount of people are selling stocks to free up money to put into dwac and phun right now due to Trumps new social media "TRUTH Social" being announced to directly compete with Facebook etc and not censor content.... Stocks like this with mostly retail investors will have many "Fomo" and "Follow the herd" mentality investors pull out of stocks just to invest with the masses. "Meme stocks" as they call it draw funds from the whole market into the meme stocks. These recent drops are not all due to cielos actions. Look at the whole market. It should also be mentioned that we have a float over 600m shares and on average 5m shares have been traded daily, many of which are penny flippers and day traders. A large, large percentage of cielo investors are simply holding and not going to let go.More,Brett,,7,2

2 hours ago,Is there not a very good chance that Don bought a couple hundred thousand shares last week to simply convince shareholders and other potentials that there is still some confidence left in the stock?  After all Don already owns about 22,000,000 shares.  It’s seems this latest purchase had done exactly what it likely intended to do….”convince us all that is still a great buy if the president himself bought a few”.   I have been on this board for 2 years now and trust me, with 70,000 current shares I am waiting for good things to happen.  The fact is currently even with desulfurization news, the SP is not holding up.  I believe we will be into the .20s end of week or early next week.  At that point I’ll be buying more!  Would like to get my position to a nice even 100,000.  It’s a long term play and as Gary mentioned, only time will tell if they make it or go bust.  One thing I can say with fairly great certainty is this is NOT some elaborate scam.  There are too many moving parts and big players involved.  All my opinion.  Buy and hold if we see the .20’s next week!More,RVH,,4,3

3 hours ago,The more things change, the more they stay the same. I stay off this thread for a week, and the same comments are posted as they were two weeks ago etc etc etc.Truth is, not one person on this thread can say with 100% certainty that CMC will be successful at scale volumes, or the process will fail. Me included.I have said this is a binary situation,. The stock is going to zero if the process fails entirely at scale, or it will be a large multi bagger if reasonably successful. Only time will tell.Right now a bunch of small players are moving the share price up and down. I doubt anyone has a position as large as mine, but you don’t see me on here everyday ranting one way or another. Let CMC mgmt do their work and we will all find out in time how successful they are.

yesterday,I don't think you guys understand that only 3m shares were traded today 🤣 upon completion of this project and when we begin commercialization (it will happen) this thing will fly up FAR faster than it came down in my opinion... Low volume and share price going down this hard tells me one thing. Very, very few people are selling at these levels but this message board is scaring off the few people gullible enough to sell and attempting at getting a better position. Do you guys really want to see this company succeed? You know, for the sake of our children and grandchildren etc. Many investors have a very, very high SP target and are not selling a single share until then. It's a very small percentage of selling causing causing SP movement. Look at our float and then tell me 3m shares a day is something to be concerned about 😅More,Brett,,8,2

3 days ago,Bert has bad news: latest stock analyst for CWSFF ( Cielo Waste 🇺🇸) is “ No changes to the price of Cielo Waste Solutions Corp. stock on the last trading day (Monday, 25th Oct 2021). During the day the stock fluctuated 0% from a day low at $0.36 to a day high of $0.36. The price has fallen in 6 of the last 10 days and is down by -5.73% for this period.The stock lies in the middle of a very wide and falling trend in the short term and further fall within the trend is signaled. Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to fall -64.45% during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between $0.0060 and $0.16 at the end of this 3-month period. Do note, that if the stock price manages to stay at current levels or higher, our prediction target will start to change positively over the next few days as the conditions for the current predictions will be broken.“More,Yo(sef) aka Ernie { Pops }🐤 😝,,5,2

Which means we now have a plant in all 50 states and 10 Provinces. Don is wrapping up a deal to build a plant in Ghana, where they have major landfill issues due to the second hand clothing sector. The share price is $36.76 and most of the people from this forum are millionaires.,Pedro,,43,5

6 days ago,Last year, Don said that they are planning to build 40 plants in the next 5 years and that only one plant would be enough for this stock to be a 10$ stock. For any investor who is gonna take him to his word on that exact 40 plants/5 years might be dissapointed as they might reach 35 or 38. Maybe they'll reach 40. But by then, a set back will not cost pennies per share but probably dollars. We have to realize that what we're waiting for, any updates on plant and production will exponentially grow from there. This is where you wanna be right now, not in 5 years from now, and not in 2 years either. I would say now the price is perfect to retireMore,Carl,,7,10

CMC produces renewable diesel with plants that make 10,000L/hour. Comparing the plants, you get the same output as GEVO expect it costs $80M USD instead of $700M USD. The market cap of CMC is 1/8 of GEVO. The opportunity is there. They must be able to produce a biodiesel with less than 15ppm of sulphur. A massive potential market for existing distribution and even more for additional plants. (Analysts’ price target is $8.00)More,Keaton,,8,2

8 days ago,Cielo said in statement not going to start building small scale test plant in Fort Saskatchewan until end of first quarter 2022,   Once that is built, then more tests , if that doesn’t need tweaks , only at that point can they start plans and permits and construction for full size .   And once that is constructed, it will need to be tested , and hopefully no more tweaking.   In all honesty this project is still a good six months to a year to come on line , and that is if no hiccups along the way.

Cielo is very dear to my heart due to the fact that they are literally on course to change the world; and at the very least, becoming a major part of saving it. My original average was .88, I've since dropped it to .51. This is by far my largest holding. The news of the successful desulferization has shown me that this is a matter of time until we are running at full throttle across North America, selling diesel at the premium price with a share price of $20.00. In the meantime, I am patiently holding. I will never sell, not even 1 share, until is hits $20.00.,Pedro,,11,2

I do read every single word in a press release and watch out for any “ cover their @&amp;)” qualifiers.. and based on last news I felt comfortable today adding $20K to my position.

14 days ago,Seems like many on this board are not understanding a very key piece of information. They have CONFIRMED that they can as of right this very moment, produce fuel at a rate of between 500-1500 lph at 15 ppm after desulphurization. This is enough for them to cover their operating costs and perthaps even edge out a small profit. Now that we know they can do that, they can focus on scaling the pross up to work t 2000-4000 lph and then sky is the limit. They have proven continuous flow at an average rate of 800 lph at highway grade ppm. That means they wont go bankrupt, and they can start generating revenue. Why is everyone so negative on this very clear and communicated fact? It may not be commercially scalable at this second but they will get there. Let them make 800 lph and they can stay cash flow neutral. That seems bullish AF to me while the scale it up. Am I missing something????More,Clarke,,0,0

Change of CEO to Gregg and a new Board will help.. but give me a break.. it takes time to build out a sustainable business plan.. and there are technology and commercializations risks with CMC.. heading in right direction but no time yet to declare “ mission accomplished”Keep another thing in mind.. this is a 55 cent stock… And only 5M shares traded?

14 days ago,I went to the Aldersyde facility awhile  back as I had a few dollars into CMC , dressed as a local field production worker looking for a specific location has always been my way into developing energy companies facilities to get some floor level information. There is zero belief or faith into this process from the staff at Cielo , the process does NOT work,. There’s been trouble paying  bills and payroll has been late a few times .

15 days ago,As much as I am still upset with Cielo not keeping investors informed properly and in a timely manner. I think this news is a HUGE deal. Something to think about is that this level of desulphurization and the technology behind it carries a massive amount of value in itself. I believe a massive hurdle has been cleared and we are back on the right path. Greg is turning things around and Cielo is lucky to have him. I was expecting this news to drop end of september as promised and it didnt. Im happy to see it now, just wish I would have been more patient. Everyone says that the stock market moves money from the impatient to the patient. This is a real life lesson of that. Its time to hold long and just enjoy the ups and downs on the way to the end. Im happy to see positive news after so much negative news. We needed it.More,Brett,,0,0

I think Gregg is shaking things up and making mgmt changes..  Cielo is becoming less a “ Don company” and Greggs thumbprint will start to show over next six months.So this is positive news.. one step at a time but my intuition is that Gregg’s hire and becoming CEO is a major inflection point in the CMC story!

19 days ago,The market might value Cielo at about 250-300 million until production actually happens and there is revenue (the board still has to prove they can execute on a plan). That is probably similar to the valuation of the company last spring when there were much fewer shares. If that's the case, the price per share should fluctuate between 0.38 and 0.46 for the time being. I expect it to trade in that range until news -one way or the other- come out or until people get tired of waiting and start to move on.Technically, a bearish death cross is forming in the daily (not a golden cross like someone said in this thread). But I don't think the stock will drop below 0.35 again because, well, people are convinced Cielo can still succeed.I took my losses and am out until news.More,Al,,4,4

I watched someone else market sell 500,000 shares like 10 minutes ago. I dont understand why cielo is so bad at communicating. Isnt Lionel a key piece of the puzzle being a part of renewable U?

While They’re not even close to continuous flow or commercialization.

They’re starting fresh and the shares are way overpriced. This time last year they were trading at .06 to give you an idea.,Dc 918,,1,6

It will be back in the 0.30 before they try and pump it again.  Then it will hit the 0.20.  Eventually it will settle in the 0.10 and 0.20 cents range.  Where it will linger for a few years till everyone forgets then they will start pumping again.  It’s always the same with these very predictable companies that make no revenue.  $4000 in revenue.

21 days ago,Someone on this thread thinks I’m a fake CFO posting propaganda on CMC.. whatever, they are entitled to their opinion ( even when it is 100% wrong). I have been successful and lucky in my career, and posting some info on CMC ( my opinion) is my way of trying to give back to younger investors some insights on gleaned while running businesses, and how challenging it is. As for investing, I clearly stated that day trading is very, very, very hard to make $ consistently,.. never confuse luck and good timing with smarts! My experience is that you might have a few successful trade timing events, confuse luck with your smarts, and then Wham, the Market goes badly against you.. trust me, when I was younger I thought I could be a day trader too.. made good trading money but lost more trading than I made over a few years if being totally honest! So that’s why a CMC is a buy and hold stock that if successful with their concept, could be a huge money maker, but I have no idea if they will be fully successful, or more importantly when! Timing this is no better than betting red or black at the casino each day!Anyway, I’ll post as some have asked me to. And if you doubt my CFO background, go to Linked In and look me up Gary DephoureGood luck to all.More,gary,,48,3

To me, that is trying to pick up pennies in front of a steam roller, regardless of long or short the stock. You might get lucky timing a trade a few times, then Wham.. the market will turn against you.For me this is a longer term BET that eventually the concept of converting trash ( especially plastics) to renewable fuel will work out. Might take another year or even two to figure out the chemistry and flow volumes, but I feel they will get it worked out. If they do, then the market opportunity to be a highly profitable company will be massive.. if technology fails, then CMC goes to zero. Pretty simple BET.After all, the stock market is a form of legalized gambling. No one is making anyone buy or sell on any given day, and no one can tell the bottom or top. That’s why I prefer to diversify my holdings and also scale into or out of a position. Last week I bought ( as I disclosed) at prices like 43 cents, 30 cents and even 24.5 cents. But I also bought at $1.20 not much more than a month ago. So no one can predict the next move. All to say I believe CMC is finally doing the right things to build a more sustainable business with new leadership, improved Board experience with connections, and eventually better financing structures. This will take time.If you want to day trade., go for it. I’m neither smart enough or lucky enough to do so consistently.. so I believe a buy and hold is far better IF you truly believe in long term prospects of CMC.. if you don’t, then sell away.. there will be someone on the other side to buy your shares., that’s a given!

22 days ago,Alright, here we go. 15 min chart has the Bollinger Bands squeezing and the candle is itching to ride the top BB. At the same time the 4 hour chart will have also caught up to the 20 ema. The saga continues on Daily where it needs to make a steady climb up to the 20 day ema. Thats a big line, If this strength continues for the rest of the week then its no issue and will blast through it. I'm looking at the 200 day ma or the 250 ema .71-.78. If we reach that and see a dip back to the 20 day ema and we bull our way to the second leg of this run... Thats the move I'm waiting for.,Michael,,4,1

23 days ago,My advice to anyone reading this CMC thread is to remember one simple fact: None of us ( including me) have any real insight into the day to day technical progress or lack thereof, on the process to covert land fill waste into fuel.  Do not trade based on the comments of a few, or get overly happy or sad with share price fluctuations.. this stock is bouncing around on no fundamental basis.. just day traders moving it mostly. The information last week was a setback of “ poorly managed expectations” by the Former CEO and Founder. There is a fine line in this role between trying to attract capital into a small business and being overly optimistic, and spreading misinformation to “ hype a stock”.  I’m in the former camp where Don’s genuine dedication and commitment to building a new technology to solve a global problem led him to be too optimistic at times. Pump and dump? No way.No one will confuse Don for a Bay Street financial executive. He doesn’t dress the part, speak the part, or act the part. Rather he is a Founder that needs to bring in more experienced “ business minded” talent to take CMC to the next level. He is starting to do that with recent management changes and a recalibrated Board.. will there be future mistakes? Absolutely! But in building a longer term SUSTAINABLE business, I feel he is putting some of the right building blocks in place. Next will be financing that gives CMC at least 24 months of cash runway.. provably through a combo of convertible debt and government grants/loans. Building this technology at scale will require more capital.. that’s a given.Watching daily ticker will drive anyone insane.. it will bounce around until there is substantive news.. my expectation is we will not hear anything too substantive until early 2022.

They are making revenue and almost ready to make a profit. Trading around 0.08. Already turning plastic into fuel and doing what CMC says they are going to do.

26 days ago,As much as it is nice to see some green ( so far) today, let’s not get too excited. A lot of investor confidence was shattered this week. IMO, CMC erred in not managing expectations and getting excited about the huge updraft in the share price. For instance, the last debenture offering has a conversion strike price at $1.25, clearly a long way from here. This adds complexity to CFO role to manage the cash flows because conversion to equity is no longer likely before the debt needs to be refinanced.,I mentioned I occasionally will take my positions from 2% to 3% of my investable capital… I have done so in past 24 hours and added over 150,000 shares.. I am repeating myself but this is a binary company., either it goes bust or it achieves very good success and it’s market cap rises significantly.One question for this thread. Does anyone know if CMC puts 10 railway ties into the process with catalyst, what expected volume of diesel is expected at the tail end? Does anyone know any lab stats on yield efficiency ever disclosed. Trying to get my arms around potential production levels annually ( assuming the process yields 75% of expectations)ThanksGaryMore,gary,,24,0

26 days ago,If you are an actual investor and not an emotion wreck because the stock price dropped. Congratulations! Way too many people are freaking out on here. You don't lose anything until you sell. If you are investing in this company and need your money in the short term that probably isn't the smartest strategy (for pre-revenue R&amp;D companies). Companies like this tend to be long term investments with the risk that they won't succeed but the upside is huge if and when they do.I get people are upset as they felt lied to or misled. Stock prices will go up and down. If you believe in them for the long term it would be good to average down or start a position. If you don't trust them or like them anymore don't invest more... You can even take it up with the company. They have their contact info posted on their website. 👍 Best of luck to everyone.More,Braden,,6,0

26 days ago,Edit: typed on my phone, lots of spelling and grammar issues.I see people are heading for the exits here, pulling what money they have left. Personally you should have never invested more than 5% into something so speculative as you become vulnerable to panic and fear. I see folks on Reddit, Facebook, CEO.ca, and other forums are losing their minds without even breaking down what they are upset aboutAnyways, I listened into the webcast and here's my thoughts:-I didn't like the explanation about the outgoing board members, it was literally them telling the two outgoing BODs to go #$%$ themselves in a polite way. Chances are we will never get a full story here.+Better explanation of what they mean by batch mode. They have produced 700 to 1000 lph continuous but have to keep stopping for several reasons mainly related to storage on site and to test other feeds. Perhaps this is also related to not having a mechanism of continuous feedstock available sitting around, in other words what they have available is finite. I get it, Aldersyde is not the ideal pilot. It was cheap and got them this far at a far better cost. I can look at companies like Gevo who are raising literal billions with plans to build a massive facility without testing on a smaller scale. I would rather them spend 1 million on a smaller scale and then spend 50million on a full commercial site IMO( please note, I have no idea how much this will cost).+Related to the last, they realize money is never ending and are hesitant to spend mass funds without taking the first steps to prove concept. It seems they wish to turn Aldersyde into a small money maker to keep them afloat while they work on the next step up commerical facility.-I was under the understanding you could throw almost anything mixed together into the reactor. This does not seem to be the case, and it may involve having multiple reactors for different feedstocks to ensure positive results and improved outputs. Essentially from what I gather by the comment of "plastic may require another pass" is they don't get consistent results from different feeds.+Related to the last, they have an idea how to feed multiple reactors into one pipeline in parallel or series to improve. Which is what they need to explore first in Edmonton as they cannot do that in aldersyde.-the output of diesel of used motor oil was surprisingly high, upwards of 50%. I guess in retrospect I should have realized when you add motor oil into the reactor it's going to end up outputted with everything else in the reactor...duh. Though I believe this needs a better explanation as to 'why' so much. Is it because they keep shutting down to reconfigure and have to add more oil when the system is essentially dry? With continuous ops will they require a smaller input of oil or nearly none at all as it operates 24/7? I felt like this needs better explanation, and I might end up emailing the company about this myself.+Desulp unit should have been operating yesterday or at least fired up.. whatever that really means. I understand that to be profitable is not dependent on sulphur levels, so it seems the company is trying to win investors over by explaining that over and over again ....to the point they seem annoyed everyone is so upset over the Desulp unit. But if it fails I see the Share price collapsing hard...if it succeeds we will see a #$%$ moon landing though it's immaterial as its too soon for the company to be valued that much.-they are not ready for commercialization. Is this on Dons enthusiasm or the investors for assuming the company was ready to just start building commerical sites tomorrow? I get it, everyone wanted to be rich tomorrow and that's not going to happen which is why the stock collapsed...we are waiting up to two more years for 4k lph facilities to come on line. Honest though, Companies like Gevo who I diversfy with as well are forecasting 2024 to get commercialized as well. We just have to waitBased on what I typed above, and straightened out my own thoughts, I'm still in for the long. The science works, it's the application for commercialization they are figuring out and need more time.The two risks here are:Desulph unit failing and cutting future profits and killing the SP. I have a hard time believing the Desulp unit will fail entirely, but expect some hiccups as they just fired it up. I FULLY expect a NR in the future saying the unit needs more work and intend to buy more shares when everyone losses their minds and sells. Let's be honest, the wright brothers were lucky when they got airborne the first try! (Or did they....I'll leave that open to discussion :) ).Running out of money. To me this is everything, they have a plan, they have the science, but what they don't have is endless money. This is why Aldersyde needs to start producing fuel to keep them afloat. The warnings are in the financials, literally the first few pages where they state the risk as they have not producMore,Felipe,,3,0

26 days ago,So, let's see what you get for $0.25 per share.$ 14 mil in cash (2) facilities fully owned. by Cielo. Exclusive North American rights to patent technology that converts waste (including all plastics) into diesel. Engineering facility that is getting closer to not only producing diesel from waste above 1000 lph, but being able to produce a product below 15 ppm Sulphur.  JV partners willing and able to pay the entire cost of 9 more facilities (once flow to scale is proven).I agree that at $ 1.50 per share, this was an over valued stock.  But at this price, it's a bloody steal!Just my own thoughts. ----------------------------------- Cheers to all!More,Ralph,,3,1

26 days ago,Could someone enlighten me on this one…..I missed the last webinar as was working but we were all hopeful there would be some good news.  If you’ve been around for atleast the last 6 months you would know a lot of emphasis was being placed in CMC finally getting the desulfurization equipment commissioned.  This of course has not happened and I am aware of the setbacks.  My question is…..did they release any official news at end of Sept as expected regarding the desulfurization or did CMC just sort of tap dance around that topic?  And secondly, did they officially come out and say they are giving up on the large scale model at Aldersyde and moving to this 60 litre per hour model?  It sounds like they are back to research and development where as before it seemed like they were on the brink of full out processing and sales.  I’m a long hold and a believer.

26 days ago,Morning…Reading this Thread can be painful at times.. clearly anger out there, and some unfortunate people that like to take pleasure when others are losing $Regardless, every shareholder has an important right coming up.. and that is to cast their Proxy For or Against various proposals ( directors, auditors, new stock option plan).. which btw, I don’t believe anyone yet has commented on the new option plan being proposed by mgmt. This is your one chance each year to let CMC know how you feel about key issues. Don’t complain if you choose not to vote. Every vote counts, and it sends a strong signal to mgmt about how happy/unhappy shareholders are, especially when significant votes are cast against proposals.So I encourage everyone to use their Proxy wisely. Posting on a Yahoo thread is one thing, casting your actual vote is the real significant right you all have as shareholders.Have a great dayMore,gary,,10,3

For the share price to change course, there needs to be real tangible news and not fluff. Until they can prove the technology to scale, it will be very difficult for this stock to rebound.,The Pragmatist,,5,2
27 days ago,Cielo has not proven this technology to scale. Reaching the required desulphurization level is pointless without achieving the required LPH rate. I have very little faith in Aldersyde. To me, it looks like throwing good money at a sink hole. The reason they are building a small scale facility is to create the correct template for all future operating facilities. As Don said, it will be "state of the art". To me, that says Aldersyde will not be the "model" plant. It will be the Fort Saskatchewan facility. After all this time, they can't get Aldersyde to work. It's time to stop burning the cash on that "eyesore". Cielo's success will depend on the success at the Fort Saskatchewan facility and not on Aldersyde.More,The Pragmatist,,0,0

27 days ago,So, I ORIGINALLY got in at .255 for 100k shares and sold and laughed at 1.4-1.5.I bought again at .7 something and sold before the second blow-out at 1.03 expecting a crash.Well, it crashed to 0.52 and I thought it was back to 1s, but with some uncertainty, rebought 5k at 0.73.I didn't pound the buy button become something seemed very fishy about the increase to .77 before me getting in at 0.73.Good thing I didn't. While I'm now down about 55% on 5k, my concerns saved me being down 55% on 100k. While I expect this to fully rebound at some point in the future, I also expect this to fall below 0.20.0.50 was tested, 0.40 was tested, 0.30 is now a holding pattern. People will very likely dump and push this further down.Remember, 0.30 is still a lot more than 0.06. this moved from 0.06 on speculation. No reason for this thing to have moved past 0.10. we will see it fall badlyI would recommend getting out before the storm if you can't afford a real shock.More,Anderson,,3,1

27 days ago,I read the nice comments and numerous up thumbs last night.. appreciate the kind words. I have tried to impart my knowledge without being overly positive or negative on CMC.. I have always counselled this is a speculative stock that I feel will have a binary outcome..   so after seeing so many ask me to reconsider, I’ll post occasionally when I think I have something of real value to add. I watched all the Don Allen videos last night. My takeaway is that he is not pumping the stock for a quick gain, but rather is just a guy that is incredibly passionate about trying to solve a global waste problem, and way over exuberant ( naive??) to how hard it is to constantly execute on a plan and hit timelines. I had a rule of thumb as CFO in business… I’d rather have a B strategy with an A execution, than an A strategy with B/C execution. Unfortunately, I feel CMC is more of the latter at this point in time.Yesterday’s call was a Come to Jesus moment for Gregg and Don and the Board. Gregg laid it all out on the table and he is very experienced.. and he will under promise and over deliver going forward. I expect Don to step back considerably and Gregg will be the future face of CMC. Raising future capital ( debt or equity) is 100% certain. To get the technology to scale, requires time and deep pockets. I suspect the government will eventually take a financial stake in CMC, once they see the technology is further along proof points.Don has been at this for over 15 years.., no one does 15 years for a pump and dump.. that’s not logical.The stock price today is “ what it is”.. it is 100% disconnected from the binary outcome that is likely down the road. In essence, buying today is a wager that CMC will achieve some semblance of success ( for me I already ratchet down my expectations on flow volumes and sulphur ppm to only 75% achievement). Selling today is a wager that CMC is going to fail and disappear in next 2 years. Do as you wish but as I said yesterday, stop blaming others for any mistakes you make! Anyway, off to a meeting but good luck to all and I’ll drop in from time to time, but less than in past.CheersGaryMore,gary,,36,3
