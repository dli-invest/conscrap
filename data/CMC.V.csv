2 days ago,I started my position with Cielo almost exactly one year ago with 70,000 shares at around .095 cents.  I tried trading here and there and lost a lot of my shares during the process.  I then added another $10,000 of my own money here and there.  Here I am be year later and I am back to owning 70,000 shares and have not really made or lost money during this time.  A lot of stress and guessing to try and time the market to make a quick buck.  The lesson I am trying to learn here is to sit tight as anything else you are just gambling with your position and just as likely to lose as your are to win!  Holding 70,000 @ .275 cents as of today.  GLTAMore,RVH,,23,0

3 days ago,CMC.V vs AKMY.V  Thoughts anyone?  What's up with this impending mortgage news for CMC?  Is it worth investing in now?,Nigel,,1,2
3 days ago,Today was a great example that the best way to invest ( or trade) is to average in or out of a positionThere is no way to tell exactly when to execute a buy or sell order. No one can time the market consistently, and those that profess they can, are either just lucky ( in the very short run), or plain out lying.I added to several positions today including CMC, Bombardier, FCX, AC, CPG, AAPL For a while I was awash in red on the day trade, but by 4PM, green across the board. Anyway, the key point is not to panic on days like today and stay the course. As for CMC, I am disappointed the mortgage matter hasn‚Äôt closed, but I know from experience the legal stuff can sometimes get delayed. I don‚Äôt think it has anything to do with a 25 basis point increase by the Fed or Bank of Canada on Wednesday that is causing the delay.  But I can agree that CMC is causing angst since they indicated it should close on or about Jan 17th.. Maybe they need to follow the smart mantra for once:‚Äú under promise and OVER deliver‚Äù!!More,gary,,12,2

3 days ago,This is nothing more than fear in the total market of rising interest rates and speculation coming out of the market.. look at crypto. CMC is a very illiquid stock.. I doubt there are more than 100 retail investors trading this.. so when there are essentially no buyers and people exiting speculative positions, not a surprise that CMC gets pushed down.I‚Äôve said it countless times., there is no analytical way to calculate the intrinsic value of CMC..  until the process proves itself ( or not), the true value of CMC is not calculable at present. I‚Äôm not suggesting buying, but if you do, just realize the 26 cent price is more a lack of buyers willing to purchase a speculative stock in this central bank fear of rising interest rates environment, than it is anything fundamentally wrong with CMC that is driving price down.Full disclosure. I bought a small amount ( for me) at 26 cents to add to my position.More,gary,,4,3

7 days ago,Chris emailed me. As expected, he said that they will put out a press release when:1. There is any change to mortgage terms previously disclosed2. The deal is closedHe indicated that sometimes the timing is outside their control. Having been a CFO, I 100% agree that sometimes things take longer ( legally) than expected., I reiterated to Chris their is some angst over another missed deadline and that the new mgmt team is digging out of a deep hole of missed expectations from the former CEO.I encouraged him to put out something allowable by the OSC to tamper down anxiety on this mortgage matter. Not sure he will.My take: they are dotting I and crossing T on the agreement, and it‚Äôs just taking longer than expected.More,gary,,13,10

But I also don‚Äôt profess ( despite my CFO experience and almost 60 years alive) to know everything or make outlandish share price predictions just to ‚Äú talk my own book‚Äù.  Rather I try to impart some knowledge and temper down unrealistic expectations ( both ways)But yes, thanks for the compliment on my 3% .. it is 100% true. I could give you my address in Burlington so you could see my house to make your own judgement , but that would just invite more stupidity and trouble.

They then turn into the most positive of investors, pumping up the stock, creating rumors through misinformation (eg. Bill Gates investment into ESG fund).   Newbies beware!  As soon as the upward rush on this stock starts to run out of fuel, the mega positive pumpers will once again short and bash this thing back down so that they can pick it up once again on the cheap.

9 days ago,Finance 101: when someone with a stock option exercises it, they pay the company the money ( # shares exercised x strike price per share). The company retains the cash and the company issues a share certificate for the number of shares exercised.This increases the number of shares outstanding and of course the shares are then eligible to be sold or held by the former option holder.But option exercises do not equate to the insiders buying that has any impact on day to day prices on the TSX. If anything, an option being exercised typically puts downward pressure theoretically on the market share price, as the option holder typically sells enough shares of the former options to cover their upcoming tax liability.  In widely held stocks, this option exercise is a ripple in the ocean. In tightly held stocks the selling pressure can exist depending on how many shares are exercised, but option exercises do not equate to upward price pressure.More,gary,,17,5

9 days ago,I‚Äôm agreeing with the 25% of you out there that know (or guessing) that the downtrend could start at any moment . I wouldn‚Äôt want to be caught holding when that happens.  Don‚Äôt get too caught up in the hype over nothing.  I am personally finding it very hard not to hop in and out of the stock with the FOMO taking control of any rational decision making.  It would be awesome to see this thing keep climbing but as Gary mentions, it‚Äôs not healthy and a bit scary.  I think we might see several days of red at some point and back into the .20 cent range somewhere. Now all of that being said, this stock has never made much sense to me.  Might climb right up to .80 cents this week for all I know.  I got busted big time with the last run up to $1.60+ last summer and then she dove all the way back to .20 cents.  Fortunately for me my a average was only about .095 cents when I started my position around this time last year.  So I guess my advice for newcomers would be to NOT start a position at this point.  You may be very disappointed if this things crashes again.  Wait a few days and see what happens.More,RVH,,0,0

Myself and a few others have indicated it is almost impossible to put a price target on CMC at this stage of its lifecycle. Just too much uncertainty in the outcome of the engineering process at this time.The proper sell price is when you are happy to sell, and who cares what anyone else thinks. It‚Äôs your money, your life and your risk tolerance.,and once you sell, don‚Äôt look back with either glee or sadness.

10 days ago,@RVH I agree 100%‚Ä¶ there has to be news or something on some platform to get the pump going. I see nothing. And I agree that Yahoo is a pimple on an elephants butt for retail investors to pump the stock.. I most likely have the largest share count of anyone on Yahoo, and if anything, I‚Äôm cautioning  and too conservative for many. So I can‚Äôt be accused of singing my own book. As for mgmt with 20 cent options, this price move is meaningless for them. Per terms of the Rolling Stock Option Plan, the options granted at end of December are at most 25% exerciseable depending on whether the first 25% vest immediately or on March 31, 2022‚Ä¶ so even mgmt can‚Äôt take advantage of this rapid price change! Or minimal if at all.The only possibility is that the new IR firm that CMC hired out of the US is spreading some news.. perhaps‚Ä¶ Anyway, it feels much better to see green, but I would not make any assumption on this recent price move as being a sustainable inflection point in the CMC story.. only positive operational results will prove the story has changed for long term success.Happy snow day here in Toronto!

12 days ago,There seems to be a few who question my sincerity and transparency on CMC‚Ä¶ whatever.. I met about 10 CMC shareholders in Oakville a couple of months ago for drinks to discuss CMC.. those that were there can attest I am real and I am long the shares. I even showed a few of them my position ( # shares and cost base) at that time via my mobile link to my account. My point recently is that irrational exuberance is rarely good for a company, especially one that needs to source new capital investment to grow its business. Smart money that will fund future growth plans like to see steady and lower volatility share prices, not roller coaster rides. This is why I am not a fan of big price changes on little or no news. Btw, irrational pessimism is the flip side of the story. Share prices can become disconnected from reality, and only time usually solves the issue.A share price is no more than an expectation of the future and what someone is willing to pay. Like a house, there is a fundamental value to the land and building, but house prices do get pushed well beyond the intrinsic value ( high and low) of the underlying asset. Think real estate in 2021 as the high side, and real estate in mid 1980s as low side! CMC is a company with lots of promise, yet numerous mistakes ( and irrational exuberance) were made by founder and previous CEO and the share price got hit hard.. probably too hard ( irrational pessimism)There is almost no way to fairly value CMC stock today., why? Because it still is a binary event whether CMCs process will economically work at scale!  There are four potential outcomes ( IMO)1. It works at scale and is economically viable ( ie makes positive gross margin $ on each litre produced)2. It works at scale but at such a cost that the company cannot turn a gross margin profit 3. The process is financially profitable, but can‚Äôt get the volumes pushed through the pipeline to make any real $ to justify the market cap of the share price4. The process does not work at allNo one knows with any certainty which of the four will result.,( and I will state once again I have no great insight either). Buying CMC at this stage of its existence is akin to investing in the Wright Brothers versus buying shares in Boeing.  Nothing wrong with speculating that the Wright Brothers back in early 1900s might eventually get an airplane to ‚Äú sustainably fly‚Äù, but no one could ever imagine that the Kitty Hawk experience would lead to the Boeings or Airbus of the day. And even if process works for CMC, a little thing called competition can nip things.. think Bombardier with their C Series plane ( by all accounts a great aircraft) that was sold to Airbus for basically nothing due to too much Bombardier debt and global competition pressureAnyway, I‚Äôm long CMC. But smart enough to not drink the koolaid that every 5 cent move in share price today gives great insight into the future. I wish it did. It really doesn‚Äôt I‚Äôm betting on the CMC ‚Äú wright brothers‚Äù to get the plane off the ground.. after that, only time will tell whether it flies 10 metres or 10000 km.CheersGaryMore,gary,,34,2

13 days ago,Guys.. this is not healthy.., I‚Äôm not selling or buying ( 1.65M shares at 52.9 cents Avg. Cost) but this is the very reason CMC share price is so volatile.. it attracts far too many novice and retail swing traders that jump on and off the bandwagon for pennies of gain or loss. No technical support or resistance levels when craziness takes over. I am a very long on this stock and I should be delighted in the price moving north.. but I‚Äôm not.. it is creating unnecessary share price volatility IMO.Anyway, I‚Äôm off to ski this afternoon. Have a nice weekend everyone!GaryMore,gary,,10,1

14 days ago,Initiated a position.Strengths:Cielo has sole right to patents that are recognized in Canada and USA (US numbers 10961465 &amp; 10723956). Process proven at bench scale. Process turns common waste products (wood, plastics, etc) into diesel and naptha. Produced batches of diesel at Aldersyde Plant. Successfully tested desulpherization process. Management team has plan to achieve revenue and improve production processes: according to plan, consistent revenue expected by Q2 2022. Constructing R&amp;D site at Ft Saskatchewan. Board of directors includes Peter Mackay and Shelia Leggett. Cielo recognized in Canada's Parliament. Weaknesses:Likely shareholder dilution incoming. Company previously missed announced timelines and production expectations, which was punished by Mr. Market. The process is currently limited to using wood and used motor oil. Canada has to pass legislation before Cielo can use plastic as a feedstock. Cielo maintains Joint Venture agreement with Renewable U, which is a private company (ie: lack of transparency spooks investors). CWSFF is an OTC Market stock.Opportunities:R&amp;D aspect of Cielo entitles company to SHRED credits (tax deduction). Large growth market and demand for renewable diesel. Limited competition. Favorable mandates from Canadian government are likely. Macro tailwind for sustainability, which could attract large pool of new investors. Possibility of M&amp;A by petroleum, energy, or waste company.Threats:Short reports published against the company. Similar private companies operating in US market (eg: Fulcrum BioEnergy). Director-Chairman Emeritus Don Allen maintains millions of shares and could dump them. Unknown and unrecognized threats.What strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats have you identified? Are there any updates or corrections needed?Disclosure: US Shareholder. Highly Speculative. Long-Term Bullish.More,Michael Dale,,0,0
15 days ago,One thing that is apparent on this thread, is the lack of understanding of basic financial concepts and tools.For instance, someone posted that Insiders bought a lot of shares. First, everyone‚Äôs definition of ‚Äú a lot‚Äù is highly subjective.Insiders were granted stock options and RSUs . Until they exercise the options and actually pay for the shares ( the cash belongs to CMC when shares issued), the options are simply a derivative product. Insiders can‚Äôt even buy the vast majority of the shares as their options haven‚Äôt vested. Until they vest, the holder has a piece of proxy share certificate but can‚Äôt trade it.Also, it makes no sense to exercise options before the expiry date of the option, as taxes are then paid. And if an option converted into a share is not held for 2 years, then capital gains tax does not apply., full marginal tax rates ( ie salary rates) apply on any option exercised and sold before the 2 year anniversary.So all this talk of Insiders buying or selling CMC shares is nonsense. They either can‚Äôt do it as the options haven‚Äôt vested, or to do so would eliminate 25% tax savings ( cap gain versus income tax rates)So, it is true mgmt now have options at 20 cent strike price.., god willing over next few years they make a ton of money on these options, as that will mean the CMC process works at scale!

16 days ago,Settle down people. As much as it is nice to see green, a 20% move on no news is not really healthy for LONG term share price stability and trend. With over 1.5M shares, of course it feels better to see a 30 cent print versus 20 cents, but the only news I think is material has been the resolving of the mortgage issue. This is a big help to CMC, although not without dilution pain.For me, I‚Äôm waiting to hear more about operational progress. Once we see some positive news on that front, then and only then will we be assured a base is in on the share price.CheersGaryMore,gary,,62,1

The last update said that they had already started the construction on the 60 lph test unit, and that things had already begun for the Aldersyde upgrade.  I have no inside knowledge, it's just something that I believe is coming down the pipe soon.Any good news on these fronts will push the sp into the high 20's, as those whom have been sitting on the sidelines won't want to miss out on what might become.  As Greg stated in the last webinar, regarding the problem of the bottlenecking and clogging issue "was a mechanical issue"  and that "the technology is sound".

last month,Watching the trading, it is now obvious the stock is being ‚Äú held in place‚Äù. I suspect, ( only a guess), that it is being pinned in place by the firms holding the mortgage paper.CMC will need a succession from the special covenant on this mortgage debt. This was a bad deal that was agreed to by Don and the Board. Stephanie Li ( CFO) tried to distance herself from accountability on my question. And for those of you that think I just pump CMC, listen to the conference call. I asked a few tough questions.. I had many more but didn‚Äôt want to monopolize the Q&amp;A session.Anyway, I put in an order for 50000 at 21.5 this morning, took 4 trades to fill, then immediately over 500K shares appear at the ask of 21.5‚Ä¶ clearly the stock is being pinned.I suspect the warrants that will almost certainly be required and issued to get relief on this mortgage covenant are being priced in low 20 cent range.. And mgmt cannot front run the warrant offer with stock option issuance.. that is why I believe no mgmt options have been granted.All to say that Gregg and team are cleaning up a lot of mistakes made by Don et al. I think Dons ego and rising share price made him feel invincible.. and he signed that bad mortgage deal. Oh well.. happy Holidays to all.GaryMore,gary,,38,1

last month,Mortgage issue‚Ä¶ here is what I think will happen.CMC will renegotiate the terms of the 6%, $12M mortgage ( less payments already made), and get relief on the special covenant. Ideally, the lenders will extend the term for a minimum of 2 years and relax the share price covenant. Debt to Equity covenants are common, along with other financial ratios ( negative covenants), but to tie it into the share price and hence market capitalization of the company is not prudent on CMCs part. For instance, a Black Friday type event could side swipe the entire market and CMC shares get pulled down. Thinly traded stocks are very susceptible to these swings. So it is not smart to have such a covenant tied onto CMC debt! There are two ways to fix this;1. CMC goes out to a new source of mortgage financing to replace existing debt, hopefully with less onerous conditions. 2. CMC renegotiates with current debt provider to relax covenants. In return, I expect CMC to provide equity warrants as consideration for renegotiating the loan. With the clock ticking towards August, the sooner CMC resolves this the better.But rest assured, more dilution is highly probable. Can‚Äôt change the past, but getting this solved sooner should relieve the downward pressure on share price.Just my opinion. I have no insights on any discussions going onGaryMore,gary,,21,0

last month,Picked up another 100000 at 22.5 centsThe $12M mortgage overhang is the most pressing financial matter facing CMC.The special covenant that allows an accelerated principal repayment on the $12M mortgage if the market capitalization of CMC declines below certain thresholds, is just stupid ( IMO)Same stupidity impacting HEXO right now too. Tying a debt repayment to equity price, especially in a very thinly traded stock, is playing with fire.. the CFO deflected her responsibility on that. She is correct it was approved by the Board. Perhaps this is why the two new directors resigned so quickly in the Fall? They saw the terms and probably saw how Don pushed it through. Anyway, he is gone and the new team will fix the situation. Will likely result in warrants being provided to mortgage holder to have them agree to change covenant terms.. but it is what it is.. I‚Äôm not happy and I wouldn‚Äôt have agreed to this if I was the CFO, but I have seen situations where a Founder overly controls the Board. He is now gone, so let‚Äôs have Gregg, Chris and Stephanie prove their worth. Not fair to tar them with same brush as previous leader and Board.Gregg have lots of insights on the continuous flow problems,, coking of BBQ analogy.. this is a big issue but if they solve it or at least get it to a situation where one can plan for ‚Äú preventive maintenance downtime‚Äù, it makes the situation much better,Like a car, we know it needs to have the oil changed once in a while. If you do, cars today give pretty phenomenal uptime performance. But let maintenance go, and reliability can be a huge and expensive problem. Same for CMC and the plugged situation. Anyway, once this mortgage headwind gets resolved ( and Stephanie indicated talks were progressing well), I feel the overhang on share price will be lifted. Still lots to do operationally to prove out CMC at continuous flow at below 15ppm sulphur, but at least the mortgage matter will get solved.GaryMore,gary,,23,1

last month,Overall, my reaction is that new mgmt team is bringing structure, discipline and transparency to the process. The former CEO was doing things his way‚Ä¶ those on the call heard me call out their CFO about the mortgage issue.. I‚Äôm sure she was panicked on how to respond .. but clearly Don set the terms and she was going along for the ride.All I can say is the 3 of them are well versed, seem pretty prepared and seemed open to discuss ongoing challenges. Clearly as I stated, many retail investors feel misled by Don.. I can‚Äôt disagree with that perspective.But Gregg et al seem like they are turning the page.. I think they deserve time to improve thingsThe CFO said they think $50-$70M in new capital is likely required over next 24 months.. I didn‚Äôt push back to hard in her at this stage.. will ask same question at next quarterly meeting. But gives you a sense that at least they are thinking about prudent capital structure and get away from this hand to mouth capital raises being done historically.That‚Äôs it for me.Happy Holidays everyoneGaryMore,gary,,50,0

last month,December 15th, 2021Saving the planet and getting rich do not have to be mutually exclusive goals.In fact, they actually go hand in hand.And if you don't believe me, just ask Warren Buffett ‚Äî the richest person on the planet ‚Äî why he's investing $30 billion in clean energy (that's billion ‚Äî with a ‚ÄúB‚Äù).Or Bill Gates, who's invested billions to facilitate new research and development into clean energy start-ups.Gates is also a member of the Breakthrough Energy Coalition, which is essentially a group of billionaires that got together to pony up billions to advance the clean energy economy. I'm talking about guys like Mark Zuckerberg, Vinod Khosla, John Doerr, Tom Steyer, Jack Ma, George Soros, Jeff Bezos, and Richard Branson.This is trillions of dollars in combined net worth ‚Äî all bullish on clean energy.Look, these guys didn't become billionaires by investing in the wrong things. They became billionaires because they're exceptionally smart, exceptionally talented, and exceptionally shrewd entrepreneurs.So while you might hear some folks on television or on some Internet message board criticizing clean energy, the richest people on the planet are investing on a massive scale.And let's face it: The best way to build wealth is to invest alongside wealthy people. It's not rocket science.More,Bangbuzz,,0,0

last month,After having watched this company and listened to the Don‚Äôs claims to fame ( possibly snake oil claims ) I feel like I fell into to the lobster pot like many Cielo investors.  What surprises me is that supposedly reputable people like Peter MacKay would allow themselves to be associated with a possibly fraudulent company.  I hope for my sake and that of many honest Cielo investor‚Äôs that The Don‚Äôs claims were not lies although when I look back a lot of information that was published made us the investor‚Äôs feel that Cielo was producing and selling its byproducts, now I ask myself what is going on, many changes at the managerial level, people put in place who should be spokesmen for Cielo are silent, dead silence from Cielo‚Ä¶did Covid get them?  What really gets me is ( if Cielo can process garbage as it claims, why not do so ). you can tweak and perfect the process as you go along but instead we the trusting investors are being left holding what seems to be an empty bag of promises.  Now I have one big objection with the Don, you got support from a spokesman in the Canadian Federal Government and if you used this platform to spread fraudulent information as to the success of Cielo it is time for the Canadian federal government to get into the Don‚Äôs empire and maybe we the investor‚Äôs can get a class action suite going against the Don et Al.More,Peter,,7,1

2 months ago,Okay so here are my thoughts about their investor's presentation https://cielows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/21.12.01.Corporate-Deck-final-posted-to-website-FINAL.pdf.  They have not strayed away from what was previously communicated, in terms of timeline which is good, they are setting real expectations here. As Aldersyde has down time for upgrades, they won't be producing much of anything until Q2. So in Q2 is when we will find out how the upgrade is working. They currently have funding for the remaining of the year which may sound concerning, however they did mention that they've been approached my many municipalities industries and countries. Whether that's true or not, time will tell. But I believe them to be true why? What city wouldn't want a solution that will help them remove waste saving cost, and in addition make money off of their waste. Imagine the garbage man saying "Hey, I will buy your garbage and help you take it away from your house." Patient is the key here. If you have patient, and you buy at this price point, you'll tend to make a lot of money. It's possible that a year from today, you'll see $1, which is 5x it's current price. 5 years from now, it's possible that is $40, no need for me to say how much money you'll make there if you hold for 5 years but I will say it anyways!. $10k today will make you a $1 million in 5 years possibly. Question is, how patient are you, and are you willing to risk losing that $10k for $1 mill +.More,Mustafa,,3,12

2 months ago,well lots of tax loss selling happening thats for sure,  but i do see late today 2 million order at a buy price of .20,  so somebody trying for low ball deal,The thing that should be on all new investors mind is thisWhen selling for a tax loss , the further the price drops the better for the individual selling , they must sell prior to year end , so December 3st. and what ever you have lost write it off on there income tax against any of 2021 income , basically straightforward.But the sweet part of this is if you sold Dec 01 2021,   and as long as you do not buy that stock again for 30 days , you may then repurchase, hopefully at price you sold at or maybe even less come jan 01 /2022,   you must wait 30 full days before repurchasing after your sell ....so hopefully you get a gain on your taxes.So i would watch as we approach year end for people who have sold for tax purposes trying to climb back on board creating demand for shares once again , happy trading to all , good luck ,                                                                STAY CALM                                                         AND INVEST WISELYMore,justtrying,,15,1

Even if some positive news comes out, there is plenty of time to decide whether to buy in or not.Their investor deck lays out their strategy.. that‚Äôs a positiveThe negative is that too many retail investors pumped up the price ( along with some questionable statements by founder along the way). Btw, notice Don is no longer shown as management in CMC in the deck? I said months ago that Gregg is a new guard at CMC.. give him a chance and time.. he is a business executive.. not a magician.. Trust me, no one on here is down more $ than me, but you don‚Äôt see my pumping or dumping CMC comments all over this thread.This is high speculative risk., CMC will be a better ‚Äú investment‚Äù and will garner institutional attention at $3+ per share.. cMC is not an investment today. It is pure speculation and risk only money you can afford to lose. For me, I‚Äôve mentally assumed $0 is a 70% chance, with a 10x to 20x potential by 2023/2024 with a 30% probability.  That‚Äôs how I read the overall situation today. And as someone posted yesterday, when you mute the cartoons and some posters on this thread, it becomes more palatable to read once in a while.Good luckGaryMore,gary,,9,13

I had also posted  similar message several weeks ago stating we will be in the teens come the new year.  To summarize in only a sentence or two, the SP was on my at about 5-10 cents last year (I don‚Äôt know exactly without looking) and nothing has changed since then. It will be back there again soon.  As Gary mentioned, no one can predict the bottom but I‚Äôm going to guess it‚Äôs around .10 to .12 cents.  Have a nice Christmas everyone and I‚Äôll see you all in the New Year.

2 months ago,Rereading all the news over the past two years on CMC, I am left with the following thoughts:1. The Aldersyde facility was never going to be a 4000 lph, continuous flow facility using wood as the feedstock. Investors were ( IMO) mislead or misguided here. The founder bears responsibility for guiding and not tampering down expectations. A lot of retail investors got caught up in the hype and soaring stock price and are upset.  2. CMC mgmt and Board are ‚Äú growing up‚Äù and slowly migrating to a less Founder driven business, by bringing in seasoned mgmt and outside engineers. This will be a 2+ year transition to restore credibility3. Realistically, I don‚Äôt see any real production volumes of distillate out of Fort Saskatchewan until late 2023 or even early 2024.  In other words, I think CMC is still an R&amp;D company until then. Assuming the process bugs can be worked out, and the darn thing works at scale, then I see CMC being acquired in 2023/2024‚Ä¶ i can‚Äôt see CMC alone being able to manage the rollout of numerous facilities. However, a much larger company could and CMC does have patents ( thru a related company) that are valuable. CMC is protected on these patents ( assuming they work at scale)4. I think a 8:1 or 10:1 reverse split is coming‚Ä¶ not that it changes the calculus of the company market value or individual ownership %‚Äôs, but I think there is a stigma of 640M shares at $0.30‚Ä¶ however, be forewarned that most times a reverse split typically allows shorts to try to push down stock post reverse split as it becomes marginable.  However, the market may already be well on its way to recognizing this likely outcome and hence why it‚Äôs at 27 cents5. I suspect the next news release will be positive to show progress on the bottleneck problem. That‚Äôs probably the easiest to fix, and CMC needs to show some positive progress on their process problems.6. I am not delighted in having to state these facts, and with over 1.1M shares at 67 cents, I‚Äôm offside quite a bit. Will it go lower? Probably as retail investors throw in the towel for tax loss selling. But knowing the bottom is as difficult as knowing the top at $1.65‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt around but when it hit $1.65 this past summer, I am sure there were some on this board saying it was going to $2 or even higher. Key point; no one has any clue on a speculative stock with no financial numbers to base any rational financial modeling..  just like Tesla.. there is zero rational for it to be worth many many multiples of Toyota, GM, Ford etc all together.Irrational exuberance works both ways.. and the market can stay irrational way longer than any of us have money.  So, I have said numerous times; cMC is a binary company., it will go to zero if technology at scale cannot work, ir it will be a multi bagger ( and likely get acquired) once technology is proven to work at scale. Buying or selling today is a wager on one of these outcomes. Have a nice week everyoneGaryMore,gary,,25,9

2 months ago,"Improving the Aldersyde FacilityCielo is focused on increasing production rates at the Aldersyde Facility to a commercial level that supports revenue generation. Earlier this year, the Company implemented various process modifications which resulted in an improvement in production performance and enabled Cielo to achieve continuous production. However, these process modifications created unintended system bottlenecks and plugging issues which resulted in decreased operational run times (the "System Issues"). Immediate efforts to rectify the System Issues proved unsuccessful. In August 2021, Cielo commenced a comprehensive analysis of the Aldersyde Facility by utilizing an internal engineering team, with the support of third-party engineering consultants and technical experts.Utilizing the findings from this comprehensive analysis, the engineering design work at the Aldersyde Facility has continued since August 2021, with the focus on reducing downtime to achieve steady-state production. Engineering modification and design are being undertaken on three elements of the existing process: (i) the process infeed mixing system, (ii) reactor modifications and improvements, and (iii) the biomass waste system management (together, the "Aldersyde Project"). The Company is pleased to announce that it is on schedule to execute the following planned work for the Aldersyde Project:Engineering design - commenced - August 2021Initiation of equipment procurement - to commence - December 2021Construction initiation - to commence - January 2022Commissioning and start-up - forecast - April 2022"More,Loup,,5,2

For cars, the US limit at the pump is 38lpmRegardless of you overstating the comparison, I‚Äôm not sure what relevance that has? Trying to compare the flow rate per hour of a waste conversion process compared to a pump designed to simply push a know and steady state product through a hose is about as ridiculous as comparing the fuel economy of a cruise ship to my 2018 Porsche GT3‚Ä¶ sure, both are ‚Äú passenger vehicles‚Äù, but that‚Äôs about as far as the comparison goes! What would make a lot of sense is to better understand the mix volumes of Used Motor  Oil ( UMO) per 1000kg of wood, and the yield ( litres) of low sulphur diesel from that mix, and how long it takes to generate the end yield. Only then can  we begin to calculate the operational  financial model of CMC relative to the cost of investment. These numbers are not yet disclosed to best of my knowledge. GaryMore,gary,,9,11

Unlike Gary, though, I don't believe the latest expense was an unnecessary gimmick to retail investors. The patent issue was a real problem and made Cielo look fishy, as the most important asset could not be included in its balance sheet. Practically, that created issues regarding royalties, the return to Cielo's investment in research, debt management (i.e. collaterals), and liquidation procedures. The dilution is bad, but the improved clarity is good.More,Al,,27,0

While I understand that Canadians are "passive" by nature when it comes to litigation, particularly compared to Americans, it seems to me that people here would have a remarkable case in a class action suit against both BNN and Bob McWhirter.While most class action suits are initiated by ambulance-chasing law firms looking for fees, and most whither and fizzle, in this case you would win.The evidence is on a video clip on National TV!I said it here months ago. This was the most blatant case of front-running I've ever seen.It was on TV!. The stock went from 30-some cents to over a dollar in 3 days after his appearance, on about 40 million shares traded( going from memory ), and then the company issued a statement saying "It was not aware of any developments that would explain the trading activity"???I'm not a shi*t-disturber by any means, but I was a broker at RBC for 30 years and I've never seen as transparent a violation as this one.The OSC is a toothless tiger.I can't say for sure, but the word on Bay street is he started bailing around $1.20.If that's true, and if somebody took action by looking into it, he'd be euchred.Many people lost a lot of money, and I think a lot of people would stand a very good chance of getting at least some of it back.I'm not going to comment or share my thoughts about this stock going forward.

2 months ago,Too many people do not understand what a Right of First Refusal ( ROFR) means in law. In CMCs case, the fact they hold a ROFR over the patent held in another company, is defacto control of that patent.The other company cannot sell the patent, assign it, pledge it etc without CMC waiving their ROFR.ROFR are very powerful, and in fact are often inserted into shareholder agreements to thwart takeover attempts ( typically in a private company)Think about it in simplistic terms.CMC has the Right ( not the obligation) to match or better by $1 any offer for the patents held by the other company. So why would any 3rd party bid for the patent, knowing full well CMC has the ROFR and can match or beat their best offer. Obviously no will will bid for an asset if someone else has the ROFR in place.  It‚Äôs like a poison pill for CMC in that they control the patent at all times. This is why I stated the ROFR is ‚Äú as is‚Äù CMC has the patent on their financial books as an asset. Pragmatically, CMC controls the patent in perpetuity, and that is all that matters.More,gary,,8,0
2 months ago,Yup. Cielo is not the only player in the waste-to-fuel sector. It is one of the companies, not THE company. I've said here before that time is of the essence  because of competition. Some investors in this board do not seem to realize that. Many other companies are using municipal solid waste (MSW) thermochemical conversion methods: Hitachi Metals Environmental Systems, Ebara/Alstom, Enerkem, Foster Wheeler, Nippon Steel, PKA, SVZ, Honeywell, and this Sparta Group people are linking today. Check them out.The first industrial-scale MSW facility opened in Edmonton on 2014 by Montreal's Enerkem and converts 100000 t/year of municipal waste into chemicals and biofuels and is allegedly able to divert 90% of the residential waste from landfills.More,Al,,1,0

2 months ago,Investor 101: Stock splits ( or reverse splits) DONOT change anything for any investor. Their share of the ownership pie remains exactly the sameIf I own 10 shares out of 100 outstanding, I own 10% of the equity. If the price is $2.00 pre split, I have $20 out of $200 market cap.If they split shares 2:1, I now own 20 shares out of 200.. in theory the price per share will fall to $1.00.. do I still only own $20 of $200 market cap.. or 10%On a reverse split of say 1:2, I now own 5 shares out of 50.. the price will go to $4.00.. so I still only have $20 out of $200 market capThese changes in share count are merely  psychological.. they do not impact the company or investor at all. The only reason they are done is to artificially change the price per share to maintain a minimum price per share listing requirement on a stock exchange, make the stock marginable ( borrow against or short against), or perhaps to lower the price per share so investors can feel good to buy more shares .., But mathematically, splitting shares or reverse split does nothing to any individual investor.

2 months ago,This is R&amp;D, price was way too ran up that even lionel, donny and raphael sold off. This is actually a good price considering the properties and what not but this was way too overvalued without financial assets(large fuel storage) to back up such share prices above 1$. I can see this being above 1$ organically for sure in 2023-2024 when they are actually producing fuel at their saskatchewan facility+aldersyde facility. The "JV" shell company is not even on my mind since i'm not ever expecting to come into fruition nor do I expect those plants/locations to be created. 40 locations is an absolute pipe dream at this point in time, realistically at the pace and rate of progression this company is going I expect them to only have these two locations over the next 10 years.More,Heavens Gate Trading,,2,1

2 months ago,Anyone who has been around for a while knows that I‚Äôm a Cielo supporter and currently own 70,000 shares.  However, if we reflect on the last year and where the stock price was last fall‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶we have to ask the question ‚ÄúWhat has fundamentally changed during that time‚Äù?  To me it‚Äôs been a lot of hype, empty promises which some would call lies, zero revenue and burning through a tremendous amount of cash.  Bottom line‚Ä¶..there is no reason this stock couldn‚Äôt go back to sub .20 cent levels in the coming weeks/months.  I am also asking the question ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt I sell at $1.65‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt believe it was greed, we just didn‚Äôt know what was going to come in the following months.  Hindsight is always 20/20 isn‚Äôt it.  I still believe in Cielo and want them to succeed.  Luckily my average was only 0.095 cents so I‚Äôm still making money at todays SP.  Hoping for a better year in 2022 and beyond.

Many of us are left holding the bag after buying in over the last year believing Don and believing he had it figured out. Now all we can do is take a huge loss or average down and continue to believe. I still have some faith but believe I shouldn't average down until the low twenties or in the teens..... thoughts? I don't believe this company is worth anywhere near its market cap at the moment in the current state the business is in. I also think we may see dilution on top of everything else...

2 months ago,Having had time to reflect on the latest NR, here is my take ...(FYI: I am in long [since Feb. 2020] and have substantial holdings).Don has always, unfortunately, over-promised and under-delivered. But he has never misled us; he simply misses his time-lines. I chalk that up to him just being too anxious to reach the goal line. If I'd been slaving away at this for 16 years, I think I would be anxious too.The latest NR was obviously not composed by Don. I hope this finally signals a realization that they must put forward more detailed and realistic (time-line) information. This NR was extremely well composed, heavy on pertinent info, and it seems it contains more realistic time-line forecasts. Refreshing to see, and well done. I do hope that they continue to keep us informed in this manner.The bottom line, based on the latest NR.... CMC will not 'take off' this year. It will be mid to late next year, or perhaps not until 2023 before we see a substantial jump in the SP. But it will be successful, and in the meantime I'll just keep adding to my holdings at these bargain prices. I can wait. And it will be well worth the wait, as all of us  'Longs' know. And there are a lots of us.More,Mike,,15,8

2 months ago,Perspective: I would be willing to wager that almost 100% of the trading in CMC is between current shareholders. In other words, there is no institutional coverage ( nor should there be quite frankly for numerous reasons).  There are over 600M shares outstanding. Even after this news update, only 1% of the shares have traded hands, and I would wager some of this volume is just day traders flipping shares for pennies.Quite simply, no one new is interested in CMC at this juncture. And frustrated shareholders are selling. The price is what the price is.. no different than my house that increased in value by 85% in one year.. why? Not because the true intrinsic value of the land, labour or building costs went up by 85%.. rather, the market perception drove it up. Same on downside.. this is just existing  investor frustration that they bought at a higher price and are scared, and very little ‚Äú new $‚Äù coming into CMC.This is a highly speculative company and there is zero guarantee it will or won‚Äôt be successful in the future. Think back to Amazon.. Bezos was laughed at for years by Wall Street and the share price was a dog.. then Bam.. it took off and never looked back. I always said IF they can get the process to work at SCALE, the market size is massive and the ability to roll out many facilities ( cookie cutters) is easily financed.. big question is whether they can achieve process goals.. at least today I read they outlined a clear and concise roadmap.

They also clearly stated that additional financing will be required at some point. No surprise at all. My overall take? CMC has now put numerous key deliverables clearly on paper and mgmt ‚Äú feet are now held to the fire‚Äù to execute on their stated plans.  I always felt CMC was about 18 to 24 months away from large scale commercialization and revenue generation. This update confirms my timeframe, so I am neither delighted or upset at all with this. However, it is well written and from a transparency perspective, a big improvement from the ‚Äú Don webinars‚Äù of the past. Have a nice weekend everyone.GaryMore,gary,,55,8

I am staying with cielo (either up or down).  I cannot afford to lose any money but will take the risk here.  If cielo goes to $8, you will have over 8 million...nice investment.,Terry,,2,2
3 months ago,Was nice meeting last evening.. about 10 showed up. I guess the general feeling was a strong belief in the CMC potential to be a game changer for the environment; disappointment at CMC management communication miscues or over exuberance in the past, feeling the company is now on the right track to solve remaining process issues, and that CMC is a long term hold.No one was a day trader, and everyone is under water on their shares. But no one is selling either., despite paper loses so far.I showed a few my CMC position of 1,001,500 shares at 71 cents cost.. which while large compared to most, is a drop in the bucket when there are over 620M shares outstanding. CMC had less than 1% institutional ownership, and until we get non retail investors involved in the company, all this day trading is just small retail investors playing around., nothing more, nothing less.Anyway, was nice to meet everyone and I was glad to share my investor experiences, CFO experiences and why I will tuck my shares into a drawer and watch CMC progress over next 2 to 3 years.. this isn‚Äôt about the next press release or financial update.. it‚Äôs about letting the CMC team get the kinks out of the process and building a viable company., and everyone agreed that will take time!CheersGaryMore,gary,,55,0
