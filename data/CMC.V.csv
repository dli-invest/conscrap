2 days ago,Bert has bad news: latest stock analyst for CWSFF ( Cielo Waste 🇺🇸) is “ No changes to the price of Cielo Waste Solutions Corp. stock on the last trading day (Monday, 25th Oct 2021). During the day the stock fluctuated 0% from a day low at $0.36 to a day high of $0.36. The price has fallen in 6 of the last 10 days and is down by -5.73% for this period.The stock lies in the middle of a very wide and falling trend in the short term and further fall within the trend is signaled. Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to fall -64.45% during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between $0.0060 and $0.16 at the end of this 3-month period. Do note, that if the stock price manages to stay at current levels or higher, our prediction target will start to change positively over the next few days as the conditions for the current predictions will be broken.“More,Yo(sef) aka Ernie { Pops }🐤 😝,,5,2

Which means we now have a plant in all 50 states and 10 Provinces. Don is wrapping up a deal to build a plant in Ghana, where they have major landfill issues due to the second hand clothing sector.

5 days ago,Last year, Don said that they are planning to build 40 plants in the next 5 years and that only one plant would be enough for this stock to be a 10$ stock. For any investor who is gonna take him to his word on that exact 40 plants/5 years might be dissapointed as they might reach 35 or 38. Maybe they'll reach 40. But by then, a set back will not cost pennies per share but probably dollars. We have to realize that what we're waiting for, any updates on plant and production will exponentially grow from there. This is where you wanna be right now, not in 5 years from now, and not in 2 years either. I would say now the price is perfect to retireMore,Carl,,7,10

CMC produces renewable diesel with plants that make 10,000L/hour. Comparing the plants, you get the same output as GEVO expect it costs $80M USD instead of $700M USD. The market cap of CMC is 1/8 of GEVO. The opportunity is there. They must be able to produce a biodiesel with less than 15ppm of sulphur. A massive potential market for existing distribution and even more for additional plants. (Analysts’ price target is $8.00)More,Keaton,,8,2

6 days ago,Interesting to see if Lionel's "weekend" comment will bear fruit for Cielo share holders.  I personally think that we may see an NR on some level of continuous flow, or maybe a new sales order.  Now that the Desulphurization system has been proven a success, the next steps are sales contracts and continuous flow.  Share price is slowly crawling in the right direction, which may, or may not be because of an imminent news release.  Needless to say I am holding.  Cheers to all longs!,Ralph,,12,0

7 days ago,Cielo said in statement not going to start building small scale test plant in Fort Saskatchewan until end of first quarter 2022,   Once that is built, then more tests , if that doesn’t need tweaks , only at that point can they start plans and permits and construction for full size .   And once that is constructed, it will need to be tested , and hopefully no more tweaking.   In all honesty this project is still a good six months to a year to come on line , and that is if no hiccups along the way.  So those who keep pumping for things to be announced next week or this month you are dreaming,    Either that or pumpin and dumping day tradersMore,justtrying,,0,1

8 days ago,I disagree for the simple reason that desulpherisation alone gives proof of concept plus their patent for a unique concept (they can convert next to anything not just feedstock) and that’s the big winner here.

Cielo is very dear to my heart due to the fact that they are literally on course to change the world; and at the very least, becoming a major part of saving it. My original average was .88, I've since dropped it to .51. This is by far my largest holding. The news of the successful desulferization has shown me that this is a matter of time until we are running at full throttle across North America, selling diesel at the premium price with a share price of $20.00. In the meantime, I am patiently holding. I will never sell, not even 1 share, until is hits $20.00.,Pedro,,11,2

13 days ago,These are the some of the current facts of information on the company that I've compiled:-Their desulphurization machine can process about 500-1500 Liters Per Hour of fuel (assumed to reach up to 4k if necessary as designed)-Their Aldersyde plant is assumed to only be able to reach 2000 LPH maximum and is undergoing modification in order to increase fuel production capabilities to reach that maximum level.-They can only produce about 200 LPH of high quality fuel and can produce a lower quality product in the range of 700-1000 LPH currently. -They have 39.7M of debt and 5.8M of working capital.-They now must build another R&amp;D plant since Aldersyde is insufficient to conduct the required testing to improve their production capabilities.-Their technology can process many types of waste material but can only currently process them individually currently; plastics and organic waste producing the most fuel compared to other waste feeds.

13 days ago,Seems like many on this board are not understanding a very key piece of information. They have CONFIRMED that they can as of right this very moment, produce fuel at a rate of between 500-1500 lph at 15 ppm after desulphurization. This is enough for them to cover their operating costs and perthaps even edge out a small profit. Now that we know they can do that, they can focus on scaling the pross up to work t 2000-4000 lph and then sky is the limit. They have proven continuous flow at an average rate of 800 lph at highway grade ppm. That means they wont go bankrupt, and they can start generating revenue. Why is everyone so negative on this very clear and communicated fact? It may not be commercially scalable at this second but they will get there. Let them make 800 lph and they can stay cash flow neutral. That seems bullish AF to me while the scale it up. Am I missing something????More,Clarke,,0,0

Change of CEO to Gregg and a new Board will help.. but give me a break.. it takes time to build out a sustainable business plan.. and there are technology and commercializations risks with CMC.. heading in right direction but no time yet to declare “ mission accomplished”Keep another thing in mind.. this is a 55 cent stock… And only 5M shares traded?

There is zero belief or faith into this process from the staff at Cielo , the process does NOT work,. There’s been trouble paying  bills and payroll has been late a few times . Granted this was when they were at 1.50-1.60  a share but nothing has changed since then. There destined for a bankruptcy. I sold out and re invested into old school oil and gas . Like it or not , fossil fuel is the best investment in energy for the next 3 years . Take your loss if need be and make it back in fossil fuels . Swallow the pride and the diamond hand bs and make a move while you can. I don’t need any harsh replies as I won’t be getting back to you.

14 days ago,As much as I am still upset with Cielo not keeping investors informed properly and in a timely manner. I think this news is a HUGE deal. Something to think about is that this level of desulphurization and the technology behind it carries a massive amount of value in itself. I believe a massive hurdle has been cleared and we are back on the right path. Greg is turning things around and Cielo is lucky to have him. I was expecting this news to drop end of september as promised and it didnt. Im happy to see it now, just wish I would have been more patient. Everyone says that the stock market moves money from the impatient to the patient. This is a real life lesson of that. Its time to hold long and just enjoy the ups and downs on the way to the end.

I think Gregg is shaking things up and making mgmt changes..  Cielo is becoming less a “ Don company” and Greggs thumbprint will start to show over next six months.So this is positive news.. one step at a time but my intuition is that Gregg’s hire and becoming CEO is a major inflection point in the CMC story!

He should be ashamed to show his face in public after taking locals and other investors on tours at Aldersyde. The amount of lies told we’re unreal. Should be in jail but instead he’ll move on to the next scam. Let this be a warning to new people here he’s not really gone he’s still a part of this through renewable u.

18 days ago,The market might value Cielo at about 250-300 million until production actually happens and there is revenue (the board still has to prove they can execute on a plan). That is probably similar to the valuation of the company last spring when there were much fewer shares. If that's the case, the price per share should fluctuate between 0.38 and 0.46 for the time being. I expect it to trade in that range until news -one way or the other- come out or until people get tired of waiting and start to move on.Technically, a bearish death cross is forming in the daily (not a golden cross like someone said in this thread). But I don't think the stock will drop below 0.35 again because, well, people are convinced Cielo can still succeed.I took my losses and am out until news.More,Al,,4,4

18 days ago,Check out Lionel Robins linked in and facebook pages...... It appears he may have left cielo on september 24th 2021? it shows him as "Former" Im not a basher, but I had someone bring this to my attention today and checked for myself. Why would Lionel Change that on his profiles if it isnt happening? Why hasnt Cielo disclosed it? Im not going to lie.... im spooked and sold my original investment. I watched someone else market sell 500,000 shares like 10 minutes ago. I dont understand why cielo is so bad at communicating. Isnt Lionel a key piece of the puzzle being a part of renewable U? Feedback? id like to start an honest discussion as shareholders. Not pumping, and not bashing. This is a genuine huge concern? as a shareholder of this company we have constantly had to read between the lines to even take a guess at what is going on and this has me concerned.More,Brett,,4,8

20 days ago,Someone on this thread thinks I’m a fake CFO posting propaganda on CMC.. whatever, they are entitled to their opinion ( even when it is 100% wrong). I have been successful and lucky in my career, and posting some info on CMC ( my opinion) is my way of trying to give back to younger investors some insights on gleaned while running businesses, and how challenging it is. As for investing, I clearly stated that day trading is very, very, very hard to make $ consistently,.. never confuse luck and good timing with smarts! My experience is that you might have a few successful trade timing events, confuse luck with your smarts, and then Wham, the Market goes badly against you.. trust me, when I was younger I thought I could be a day trader too.. made good trading money but lost more trading than I made over a few years if being totally honest! So that’s why a CMC is a buy and hold stock that if successful with their concept, could be a huge money maker, but I have no idea if they will be fully successful, or more importantly when! Timing this is no better than betting red or black at the casino each day!Anyway, I’ll post as some have asked me to. And if you doubt my CFO background, go to Linked In and look me up Gary DephoureGood luck to all.More,gary,,48,3

21 days ago,Someone asked for my advice on what to do.  I assume they mean because the share price is bouncing back.My perspective had not changed. I’m not a day trader. To me, that is trying to pick up pennies in front of a steam roller, regardless of long or short the stock. You might get lucky timing a trade a few times, then Wham.. the market will turn against you.For me this is a longer term BET that eventually the concept of converting trash ( especially plastics) to renewable fuel will work out. Might take another year or even two to figure out the chemistry and flow volumes, but I feel they will get it worked out. If they do, then the market opportunity to be a highly profitable company will be massive.. if technology fails, then CMC goes to zero. Pretty simple BET.After all, the stock market is a form of legalized gambling. No one is making anyone buy or sell on any given day, and no one can tell the bottom or top. That’s why I prefer to diversify my holdings and also scale into or out of a position. Last week I bought ( as I disclosed) at prices like 43 cents, 30 cents and even 24.5 cents. But I also bought at $1.20 not much more than a month ago. So no one can predict the next move. All to say I believe CMC is finally doing the right things to build a more sustainable business with new leadership, improved Board experience with connections, and eventually better financing structures. This will take time.If you want to day trade., go for it. I’m neither smart enough or lucky enough to do so consistently.. so I believe a buy and hold is far better IF you truly believe in long term prospects of CMC.. if you don’t, then sell away.. there will be someone on the other side to buy your shares., that’s a given!

The saga continues on Daily where it needs to make a steady climb up to the 20 day ema. Thats a big line, If this strength continues for the rest of the week then its no issue and will blast through it. I'm looking at the 200 day ma or the 250 ema .71-.78. If we reach that and see a dip back to the 20 day ema and we bull our way to the second leg of this run... Thats the move I'm waiting for.,Michael,,4,1

22 days ago,My advice to anyone reading this CMC thread is to remember one simple fact: None of us ( including me) have any real insight into the day to day technical progress or lack thereof, on the process to covert land fill waste into fuel.  Do not trade based on the comments of a few, or get overly happy or sad with share price fluctuations.. this stock is bouncing around on no fundamental basis.. just day traders moving it mostly. The information last week was a setback of “ poorly managed expectations” by the Former CEO and Founder. There is a fine line in this role between trying to attract capital into a small business and being overly optimistic, and spreading misinformation to “ hype a stock”.  I’m in the former camp where Don’s genuine dedication and commitment to building a new technology to solve a global problem led him to be too optimistic at times. Pump and dump? No way.No one will confuse Don for a Bay Street financial executive. He doesn’t dress the part, speak the part, or act the part. Rather he is a Founder that needs to bring in more experienced “ business minded” talent to take CMC to the next level. He is starting to do that with recent management changes and a recalibrated Board.. will there be future mistakes? Absolutely! But in building a longer term SUSTAINABLE business, I feel he is putting some of the right building blocks in place. Next will be financing that gives CMC at least 24 months of cash runway.. provably through a combo of convertible debt and government grants/loans. Building this technology at scale will require more capital.. that’s a given.Watching daily ticker will drive anyone insane.. it will bounce around until there is substantive news.. my expectation is we will not hear anything too substantive until early 2022.
