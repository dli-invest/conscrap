yesterday,""I think we will see a flurry of retail bankruptcies likely in the first quarter of 2023" Mark Cohen, former longtime CEO of Sear Canada and current Columbia University professor of retail studies, warned on Yahoo Finance Live "reitmans will be part of that. be smart and dont hold the bag! cut loss,Roxy,,0,0

last month,What am I missing? EV 50mm, LTM EBITDA 108mm, trades at 0.5x multiple? Ok let‚Äôs be more conservative and just annualize last Q 9.9mm (slow season) - run rate 40mm EBITDA company trading around 1x? There is some nonsense conversation that this company did not generate cash last year - please explain how they have 40mm cash balance - higher than in January 2021, inventory is up - meaning they actually put more cash to work - and all this after paying 95mm in cash in bankruptcy and no debt increase - did they get that cash from air or they actually generated 115mm cash from operations last year which then was mostly used to make that 95mm payment. So this is cash printing machine, wake up people. Current inventory 137mm - even after huge discount still enough to cover market cap in liquidation plus current cash. Almost 100mm of other liabilities eliminated. I don‚Äôt have to believe in 100mm EBITDA run rate, just use last quarter- 9 mm cash generation from operations plus 9mm from working capital return - all this vs 50mm market cap‚Ä¶please poke holesMore,Al,,1,1

2 months ago,couple things here: on a TTM basis, this company is not as cheap as you think given the competitive pressures that it‚Äôs facing from e-commerce and other brick n mortar brands (just look at deterioration of gross margins over the past decade). It produced ~7.7mil CAD in ‚Äúnormalized‚Äù FCF in 2021 - normalized in quotes if you back out the one-off 114mil CAD paid towards liabilities subject to compromise. Other than (1) change in capital allocation - return of dividends or (2) improvement of operating cost structure, what about the future of this company excites you at current levels? I hear a lot of ‚Äúre-list to TSX‚Äù takes and that sounds to me like bet on a beauty contest. What about the company then will make investors on TSX excited to pile in?More,Dina Cece,,4,0

6 months ago,Fresh off the heels of creditor protection, Reitmans (Canada) Ltd. has announced plans to launch an online marketplace for women‚Äôs clothing.The Montreal-based company says RCL Market will be available online this fall and feature its three brands, Reitmans, Penningtons and RW&amp;CO.Reitmans says the marketplace will also offer ‚Äúhand-picked quality value products offered by partner brands‚Äù and is inviting interested vendors to apply to sell clothing on its new site.SKIP ADVERTISEMENTARTICLE CONTINUES BELOWJackie Tardif, president of the Reitmans brand, says the company‚Äôs e-commerce business has grown exponentially in recent years and RCL Market will further transform the way its customers shop online.Reitmans said earlier this month it had paid $95 million and exited creditor protection after nearly two years.The company said it paid court-appointed monitor Ernst &amp; Young Inc. to distribute funds to creditors according to the plan of arrangement.Reitmans filed for creditor protection and obtained an initial order under the Companies‚Äô Creditors Arrangement Act in May 2020.More,LeMAY,,0,0

last year,Hey guys. Haven‚Äôt been on here lately. But yeah I‚Äôm back and that‚Äôs only for one reason .80-.90 Reitmans is coming up.,vishesh,,0,0
last year,Reitmans is in CCAA protection this of course makes it a high risk investment and in turn will keep the stock price down simply because not everyone has the same appetite for risk. If you can afford to invest in something that is high risk then consider investing in Reitmans. Read up on the CCAA progress, keep an eye out for the quarterly report April 19th and coming announcements in May when it looks like they'll get out of CCAA protection. COVID accelerated Reitmans' financial decline and brought to light issues that were occuring over the past few years at the company merely from going through CCAA restructing. Since last May they have used the CCAA restructuring as an opportunity to get rid of entire brands and stores that weren't profitable like Thymes and Addition Elle. They moved product lines that were selling well to their Reitmans stores and adapted product lines for everyone working from home. They negotiated better rents and have since then met their obligations and commitments under the CCAA restructuring. Read CCAA documents by searching for Ernst &amp; Young + Reitmans.If you're worried about Reitmans closing shop for good, Smartset had 100-150 stores when they went bankrupt and Reitmans still has over 400 stores including multiple brands that they could still close or sell off (Penningtons, RW&amp;Co, Reitmans) so it's not yet time to panic. It's always difficult to close down stores and lay off employees but COVID/CCAA restructuring gave them the excuses they needed to make drastic changes last May and since then no further closures have been needed.Reitmans has hit 20-25$ a share in their lifetime, Canada Goose, Aritzia and Gildan are at 30-50$ a share and there's a difference of 100 million dollars in revenue between Reitmans, Canada Goose and Aritzia. Reitmans in their worst year pre-COVID had over 800 million dollars in revenue so this is not a small company and people ARE buying their products.Online shopping aside people will need and want new clothes when stores fully re-open even if they're only going back into the office 10% of the time. Ask people around you if they've gained/lost weight during COVID. Ask women around you if they shop at Reitmans. Reitmans being one of the only stores that tailors to a wider range of sizes is well positioned to recover when out of CCAA protection as well as when COVID dies down.I'm bullish on Reitmans at 145000 shares with an average cost of 0.29$. I plan to sell half at 5$ and the rest at 10-15$ if they don't bring back dividends by then. I am not a day trader, I am not selling shares to try and make a 15$ profit, I'm in it for the long haul and I am willing to take on the risk.I fully understand that everyone is not in my situation and others may not want to take the risk. Do your research and if you can or want to invest based on your own situation then invest; if you can't or don't want to invest then simply don't invest. There are no crystal balls, information is based on my own research. If you're bullish or bearish on Reitmans tell us why!More,DoYourDue,,9,4
last year,Pretty flat lately and very low volume. Can‚Äôt wait until the moment of truth this coming quarter. So far the debt is going down and the profits are rising.
