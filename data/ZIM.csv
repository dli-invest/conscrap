3 days ago,EPS estimates are growing every week. We should do nicely until earnings and dividend. A PE of 2 gives a shareprice of $76 which is still a bargain. I expect we will go beyond that in March, reaching $90. At this level this containershipping gem is a steal. I buy some more.,Reinder,,8,1
3 days ago,Ukraine account for roughly 1 million TEU annually. In the scheme of things I don't think it will have a big impact. Assuming the world would stop might get shipping to zero.

My question is,  Should I even consider putting money into a QLAC?   I think I should not.  thanks I suspect you are aware,  funds in a QLAC are not subject to RMD  rules.

They are not set in stone like MO or BTI.  I will need to move ZIM from the 401 acct. and put it into the taxable acct. As I posted, I only paid $300 to the IRS last year.

7 days ago,I have a question.   Can one expect the ex-dividend date to be approx March 15?  If I am to keep ZIM, I must move it to my "taxable acct."  Another question, for some reason there are not very many knowledgeable posts in the Eagle postings.  EGLE does NOT give a definite date for ex-div.

8 days ago,PAUL: To follow up on my earlier post;  After reading the latest opinions herein, I question holding ZIM now, but the div. is the thing that is enticing. On one hand, I expect the Oxford information as reliable about the, I will say "unacceptable" policy of taking 25% of the div. as " graft money" in one's retirement acct. If I hold ZIM, I must sell it in my 401K, and switch it with ESEA in a non-ret. acct. to avert the 25%kick-back.  I don't know if ESEA being based in Greece, pulls this.  I still have about $3,000 in losses on my acct. that I can use the credit against. I am not knowledgeable in these accounting tricks.       All input is welcome, thanks.More,Michael,,0,0

Big Profits on the High Seas: Invest Now in This 15% YielderThis Company Is Busting Open the Supply Chain… and Poised to Pay a Fat Dividend Next MonthMarc Lichtenfeld • Chief Income Strategist • The Oxford ClubThe tax rate charged by the Israeli government is 25%. That will be taken out of your dividend before you receive it. If you hold the stock in a taxable account, you will be eligible for a foreign tax credit from the IRS. If you hold it in a tax-deferred account, you will not receive the tax credit but will still have the 25% taken out of your dividend.

I sold out in April 2020, playing it safe, then the market went back up to the highs while I sat safely on the sidelines. At least Yahoo is not posting how RICH everyone in the country is now!  That is why the best thing to do is hold your ground unless you believe in the end of the world. I'll stick with Buffet for now. The drop today wipes out my gains in ZIM, but I will hold.  The market is taking out a lot of anxiety and pain on the stocks most of the country has, (in my opinion), NFLX, NVDA, LRCX, USD, FTEC. Yes, these are a few of the stocks that give nice returns. It is best to quit watching the media and the 4-star guys that want to destroy the world.  The market seems to be hitting ZIM more than others today.  Hang in there.More,Michael,,6,0

Too many posts are from the past, and I have taken up a good position here recently. I'm not into SOXL since the selloff, they were up 9% yesterday, then gave it all back today, so what did one gain?  I also have ESEA, and SBLK, (regardless of what Zach's rates them.)

14 days ago,Zim has a P/E of 2.2.  Their renegotiations are in may which should increase earnings by at least 20% at a minimum.  Their free cash flow is 3.6 billion with sales of 8.6 billion.  They net 3.3 billion!  They could pay off all their debt right now with their cash on hand which is crazy for the sector, so they are technically debt free.  The realistic SP here should be over $200/share.  Div yield is above 14% which is only 35% of their net income and 33% of the FCF.  They could even raise the DIV.  The P/E average for the industry is 30.  Theirs is 2.2.  This is absolutely unheard of.  Very bullish.  In the shipping industry prices fluctuate all the time, however they have to honour contracted pricing.  Prices have tripled since 2018 for dry containers.  In may they will likely get inflated higher as demand is astounding.  Again, this is very bullish, the stock could literally explode higher.  P/E comparables for the sector are Star bulk 100x, Matson 6.4x, Golden Ocean 4.8x, Costmare 5.6x, Genco 24x, CPP 9x, Diana shipping 88x, and the list goes on.  So if you like the shipping sector, 2.2x is incredible.  Demand in the sector has gone parabolic and interest rates rising obviously kills all stocks, HOWEVER shipping mainly fluctuates by demand and how many ships are in the regions.  It takes years for ships to be made and added to the region which leads me to believe that the sector will rise for the coming years as demand is absolutely exploded.  These are my thoughts, and you buy stock with your own money.  If you are entering the sector, ZIM is the best priced option IMO.  GLTA, see you at $200+!More,Richard Carter,,21,3

19 days ago,@Aniket Marketbeat shows ZIM short interest as of Jan 15th was 3.43m shares, an increase of 1.1m (47%) shares.  Dec 31 close was 58.86, Jan 14 close was 63.70.  Then the downturn, Jan 24 intraday low was 52.50, then rallied to close at 57.48.  I wonder how many of the shorts closed their positions on the 24th? Won't be long til they post the end of Jan short positions, given the volume on the 24th was just shy of 6m shares.  It will be curious to see.  We might see some minor downs, like today, but it is likely too close to earnings to see a big downturn like a couple weeks ago.  DAC is a different kind of company, so I expect their earnings to be very good, but probably not thru the roof like ZIM, especially since they focus on long term leases at a discount to spot and the Gemini ships came in with contracts attached.  SA shows "consensus" at $4.94 for this release (and that includes 2 upward revisions in the last 90 days).  BUT, a lot of people think ZIM and DAC are the same types of companies, so it will be interesting to see the results and reactions...If they come in at expectations, with a share price of $95, that would give them a 5.8 PE TTM, but only a 3.5 forward PE against SA current earnings projections.More,Randall,,8,0

22 days ago,In reply to Bullrun. Revenue has increased primarily because of higher rates. Industry volumes and rates were increasing prior to Covid. Covid shut down demand initially and shipbuilding. Zim has gone from 70 ships to about 110. Their business model has been to be flexible and to cut back unprofitable routes when rates are lower. Recent decisions reflect their desire to guarantee longer term ship availability. I think Zim  believes their customers need to know they can serve their long term needs.,Burnell,,7,0

Is the huge jump in revenue something tied to the pandemic or is this something they are expecting to continue.

23 days ago,@Jackson - I am posting new since replies, as you have noted, are not working. I have followed your posts &amp; tend to agree with your cautious approach. Of three stocks you follow that I don't own - KOS/UNFI/TGH - which do you think will pop the most with their upcoming earnings report? KOS looks like they are in a sweet spot, UNFI is a little out of vogue in today's environment and TGH doesn't look as good as either CMRE or GSL. The only stocks I own outside of the container group are CLF &amp; JXN. You must of at least have looked at JXN. Both are very undervalued but I don't see an explosive upside like ZIM. Nevertheless, I expect both to end 2022 close to double what they closed at Friday. ZIM, on the other hand, is so good I'm going to buy back my March $70 calls in my ZIM covered calls. I'll at least hold stock until the earnings report. My other positions in ZIM are all puts I sold, which will expire worthless, at an array of prices.

26 days ago,Looking at a few sites that provide analysts price targets, there are seven providing targets and the median is $76.  However, if you factor out the $43.04 low, adjust for the change in Barclays from 60 to 76, then the median PT for the 6 remaining analysts is $84 (with a high of $90).  So the one at $43.06 which came out a while back, when they felt that rates in 2022 would crash, is the outlier.  So, median of 84.  I would think that they would reach a high with the upcoming quarterly release and Q4 big div.  Then, ex div drop, then perhaps start to ease back or float sideways for a while with some upside volatility as we approach each quarter that the rates have stayed high.  If ZIM releases quarterly in mid march, then we should get some great insight to Q1 (since it will be almost over) and Q2.  It will be interesting to see how close J. Mintzmyer 2022 quarterly projections hold up.More,Randall,,21,1

last month,relax ... the good news keeps rolling in - today from Danos:ATHENS, Greece--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Danaos Corporation (the "Company") (NYSE: DAC), one of the world’s largest independent owners of containerships, announced today that it has entered into new charter arrangements for 11 of its vessels ranging between 2,500 to 10,000 TEU with major liner companies, that significantly improve cash flow visibility and charter coverage. These charters, which have a revenue weighted average contract duration of 4.7 years commence on the expiration of the vessels’ existing charters between February 2022 and April 2023 and extend up to May 2028.The new charters increase the Company’s contracted revenue backlog by approximately $870 million, or by approximately $700 million in contracted EBITDA. Inclusive of these charters, total contracted operating revenue was $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, with a remaining average contracted charter duration of four years, weighted by aggregate contracted charter revenue. Additionally, contract coverage in terms of operating days is now 95% for 2022, 77% for 2023 and 57% for 2024.The Company has also entered into an agreement to sell two 20-year-old 6,422 TEU vessels for a total consideration of $130 million and are expected to be delivered to their buyer in November 2022. The Company acquired these two vessels as part of the consolidation of Gemini Shipholdings Corporation on July 1, 2021, based on a fair value of $73 million, and expects to book a healthy profit when the sale is completed.The Company’s CEO, Dr. John Coustas commented:“We are very pleased to announce the continued improvement of our contracted backlog with multi-year charters for 11 of our vessels and the profitable sale of two older vessels. The combined result is up to $1 billion of contracted revenue accretion and sales proceeds. These transactions significantly improve our liquidity and cash flow visibility for the next several years and further strengthen our balance sheet. We will continue to work to maximize our profitability and secure more accretive transactions with a focus on creating value for our shareholders.”More,Hardball,,5,0

He noted that the retail sales-to-inventory ratio is now three standard deviations below its 10-year historical average and that this ratio is inversely correlated with container rates, “which makes sense as lower ratios imply strong consumer demand and the need for inventory restocking.”“If we assume a reversion to pre-pandemic sales-to-inventory and use current demand, retailers would need $821 billion in inventory. Taking the fastest inventory has grown — which was November 2021, up $12 billion — it would take retailers 17 months to restock. “While we acknowledge restocking could be faster … as supply chains work themselves out, the resurgence of COVID, in our view, tempers the notion that the unwinding of the supply chain congestion will be … easyMore,Kevin,,0,0

last month,Washington Post 1/13/22 Edited For Key PointsAlmost overnight, operating&nbsp;box ships has&nbsp;become a license to print cash. Zim, the Israeli carrier&nbsp;is swimming in money. To recap briefly, port congestion wrought by the pandemic has been terrible for most of us, but it’s meant the container lines can charge pretty much whatever they want for cargo space.&nbsp;It looks increasingly like 2022 will deliver a similar bounty.Zim was&nbsp;well set up to seize advantage of the extraordinary market conditions: Trans-Pacific services, which cater to booming U.S. consumer demand and are currently among the most lucrative, account for around 40% of its container volumes. It also has unusually high exposure to very elevated short-term (spot-market) freight rates, rather than lower value multiyear contracts.  New environmental regulations will force vessels to slow down, Zim’s management has argued, requiring more vessels to carry the same volume of goods. Plus, backlogs at U.S ports may prove to be quite persistent. Perhaps then investors will accept container shipping has really changed its spots.More,Hardball,,18,0

In 2020, the company accumulated losses of $1.523 billion. Now not only do the profits cover the losses but Zim is the most profitable company in Israel, requiring it to pay a high tax rate.-In any case, Israel has not previously had shipping companies of a size that made the issue relevant.

last month,Whenever the share price approached 60 it seemed that some large owner was dumping. We know it was not DAC and likely not KEN so that points to DB.  Would be bullish to hear that DB has liquidated their shares.  Maybe the dumper has more and is waiting for higher price but I think they are sold out. If true, that leaves DAC with  a little over 7.1 million shares. Even at 65 per share that would be less than 500 million if they would buy DAC shares.  That leaves a ton of money for dividends.,Burnell,,2,0

last month,J. Mintzmyer says - ZIM is set to report of $30/sh in EPS for 2021 alone, and based on current rate levels, it looks likely that 2022 could exceed that performance. ZIM has already returned $4.50 in dividends and is set to pay an annual dividend of $10-$14 in the next couple of months (based on 30-50% of FY21 earnings).,Kevin,,0,0
last month,From Seeking Alpha article by shipping stock analyst  J. MintzmyerI now expect $13.00-$14.50 EPS for Q4-21 ($13.75 midpoint), $10.00-$14.00 for Q1-22 ($12.00 midpoint), and $7.00-$10.00 ($8.50 midpoint) for Q2-22.My current 'fair value estimate' for ZIM is $77.50, for about 37% upside. This is an exceptionally conservative estimate, which only includes excess earnings expectations through Q2-2022. If freight markets remain strong throughout 2022, then ZIM could easily be a triple-digit stock by mid- to late-summer.More,Kevin,,0,0

The slowing of these two major Ports will add to the already massive back up. As the number of ships leaving port become even more limited, manufactures will pay more to ensure their containers get loaded, this will aid in keeping container rates high for a even longer period. Also on the horizon - Chinese New year will add to mix of complexities.More,Kevin,,1,0

last month,Looking to get into ZIM at a discount and feel like you missed a great chance when it dropped heavily for no good reason last month? Well you still can, arguably, by buying shares in Kenon Holdings (KEN). I just did myself today to go along with my positions in ESEA and DAC. While those two stocks are incredible value plays in their own right in the container shipping space, and while DAC has a sizeable ZIM position just like KEN, KEN's stake in ZIM is even larger (it owns 26% of ZIM). Of course, KEN isn't a shipping pure play, but its ZIM position accounts for a large  proportion of its assets and you arguably can get those very valuable assets at a significant discount just by owning shares of KEN. As a bonus, it will be handing out a fat $3.50 USD per share dividend soon. The ex-dividend date for KEN is Jan 18 if I am not mistaken).And to all you shareholders of ZIM who didn't miss any chances, I just want to add that I am very, very bullish on ZIM shares and believe they are trading at an absolutely incredible discount all by themselves. If I did not believe that, I would not have bought KEN today.$ZIM $ESEA $DAC $KENMore,Value Finder,,0,0

last month,Not quite sure where the rhyme or reason is in containership stock trading today: ZIM trading up and down the breakeven line but relatively stable on a down 500 DOW day, or Hapag Lloyd mysteriously taking a 8.6% hit in the German market. (Maersk was down only 2.5% in Copenhagen). Do I think ZIM ought to be trading down on the down market day? Absolutely not. Often ZIM trades up on down days. But I wonder why Hapag took the hit today.As far as my containership positions go, I don't currently hold ZIM but retain exposure through an outsized DAC position. Also, I rebought a similarly outsized ESEA position today at the firesale price of 24.25. Forward P/E of ESEA at these levels is less than 2 which makes it even cheaper on a forward P/E basis than DAC, which of course is also very cheap. I do like DAC's ZIM holding though.All these stocks should be much, much higher.$ZIM $ESEA $DACMore,Value Finder,,8,0

2 months ago,I recommend visiting Zims website. Among other information one can find a schedule of their association arrivals and departures at a vast number of ports. For example there may be 10 ships leaving Tampa in the next two  weeks. One or two of those ships may belong  to Zim. The itinerary is to the same Mexican ports  and takes about 2 weeks when the ship returns to make the same trip again. It is thought that Zim has less contracted than do their competitors. If a customer contracted to ship on this route would he contract with Zim or with the association ?  How does somebody not in the association compete? I  can believe that rates on this route may be less in two years but do not believe overnight the association will be quoting unprofitable rates. Analysts base their projections on what has happened in the past. I believe the associations will have a large affect on future  profits.More,Burnell,,2,0

Kenon is the largest shareholder with over 30 million shares. Kenon is largely owned by the the family that controlled Zim before Zim went public, Zim interests and Kenons interest are very closely aligned. It would seem stupid that Kenon would flood the market when price approaches 60 unless they are trying to keep the share price down so that Zim does not need to pay as much for their shares that they buy from Duetch Bank. Zim has the cash  to buy a lot of shares, 25 million shares at 60 would be 1.5 billion and Zim could do that. Hard to believe if such a deal was on the table that DB would be driving the price down. I would think that Zim buying a large amount of shares would be a catalyst for share price to increase. Seems to me any large shareholder would also believe that to be true and would not be selling until it is clear what Zim will do with all their cash.More,Burnell,,2,0

The initial estimates were at 12,90 $ USD for FY2022 and as of Today they are standing at around 23,80 $ USD per share.All I care is accumulating at this price.Don't forget, 92 ships at in January 2021 for ZIM and NOW 113 ships at sea as of November 29th, 2021.21 more ships at sea (and I am not even sure as of November 29th, ZIM had taken possession of the 7 second-hand vessels they acquired in the end of October).More ships generating more revenues, a couple billions in the bank starting the year 2022, container prices still staying sky high, I am guessing we are going to pull more than 6 $ USD for Q1 2021 (as per estimate consensus haha)ZIM can't go wrong from here.More,ZeusTheGreek,,0,0
2 months ago,I will be honest.  And I would ask everyone to share your educated views.  There seems to be something very odd about the valuation of shipping stocks.  I do not understand why they seem to defy the normals.  How can stocks have a 2 or even 5 PE and generate so much profit?   Is it because normally these companies act as utilities and there is no growth?  If we assume wall street is greedy, and they have basic situational awareness, why aren't they scooping this stuff up?  I have seen some 2022 estimates (clearly dated) that show the revenue plummeting.  But even if there is a return to ordinary supply and demand, is there not growth and a business that should rate higher than low single digits PE values?  Is there a concern that one dominant family or the state of Israel will do something weird?   I have a accumulated a ton of this, and wonder if I made the biggest mistake of my life or the best.  While I appreciate the cheering and optimism, does anyone have an answer to the odd, intrinsically low PEs of shipping companies, and ZIM in particular?More,Kenneth,,0,0

2 months ago,There is a parallel to draw between ZIM and SWA which years ago had that fixed dollar long term fuel cost contract that propelled the company from a low budget carrier into a the major carrier that they are today.  Right now ZIM has ship leases locked in at advantageous low historical prices compared to today's market value.  At the same time, per container rates remain sky high (at a time of the year that is perennially a low profit time for shippers).  Rates per container typically go up in spring and into summer which is the busiest time of the year for shipping companies.  ZIM can now take advantage of this over the next 10 to 12 months and build even more balance sheet strength which can position them to make all sorts of moves in the future (perhaps pivoting to a buying model with cash and no debt?).  When you have cash and minimal debt, the world is in your hands.Occasionally, companies stumble on their fortunes timing things right that are generally out of their control.More,JP,,13,0

2 months ago,my guess on future ZIM earnings :2022 will be real good still - $25/share range (if things start to normalize in 2022 it will be during zim's high season Q3/Q4)2023 things normalize, including shipping volume going up slightly (most likely) BUT as with most price bubbles (take lumber as an example) prices stabilize @ 25% minimum above previous "normal" of 2020, zim will have more ships than 2020 "normal, zim will have enough cash on hand to pay off all their committed to leases so no need to raise any capital for operations. they will be making $8-$10/share vs. roughly $5-$6/share in 2020 and paying $2/share dividend2024 and beyond should be like 2023 but with less "free cash flow" but still same EBITDAi don't see a world wide recession or even a US recession any time soon which is what would cause shipping volumes to collapseMore,paul,,0,0

2 months ago,ZIM traded at $51 when they declared earnings and the $2.50 Q3 dividend.  It has almost eliminated debt, an incredible cash position, and is in a market where it should command premium pricing for at least the next 12 months, so cash will only increase.  Meanwhile, you can get in today under $50 and probably receive $12.50 in dividends in the next few months (after Q4 they are going to an annual dividend), if not more because of a gaudy cash position and no debt.  So that's pretty much a guaranteed 25% return on dividends alone, even if the sp never goes up from $49.This is investing.,JP,,8,1

Posted last week and got a flurry of replies - some very insightful and others, well, you know - but in any event, ZIM goes X-Div on the 15th and we're still free-falling with reckless abandon?? "Paul" posted back to me an attempted insult but that's okay..he made a good point in his rude haste: that I had been hasty in my flippant statement of "fraud or scam". That is a mistake and I didn't mean it to come out that way: my comment, albeit terribly worded, had to do with the forward expectations and/or specific business climate for ZIM. My apologies for the inference to a "scam"..clearly this is a well healed shipper. However, I reiterate, something is not out in the market here as the selling is relentless, even down 15 - 20% in just days. As stated before, I've been in the securities industry for over 30 years and this is typically a pattern stocks take on as enterprise/industry expectations shift.

2 months ago,Help me understand what has happened.  One theory is that DB contracted with Credit Swiss to sell their 14 million share for 54.90. Share price got to over 61.00 and it seems that probably 7 to 10 million shares  could have been sold above 55.00. Volume today is maybe a little over normal. If  Credit Swiss did sell 7 million shares , does that mean they have another 7 million to sell?   Do you think they would take such a risk?  If their average selling price on the first 7 million was 58 they could come out by averaging 52.00 for the next 7 million. Maybe they could get Zim to buy like 5 million shares at 53.00.  It would not surprise me if they had not covered themselves somehow with such a deal.  How soon will we know what has happened?More,Burnell,,0,2

2 months ago,DB may have sold or are selling but I am buying. Here is why. By year end Zim will have 35 per share cash and have paid me 2.50.  I think they will make 35 per share in 2022 but lets be conservative and say 25. A year from now they will have paid me $20 per share and have $40 cash per share. $20 cash is still worth $20 and a company that has $40 cash per share is worth at least $40 . Discounted for present value that might be $55 . Both VIE and Gonzales are forecasting $35 per share for 2022. There is an article on seeking alpha which espouses this view.  Ok ,you say ,what about 2023. In 2023 the new builds will start to hit the water and maybe a little sooner than when Zim receives their new builds. Point is that rates will not be dramatically affected on January 1, On the other hand existing vessels will be required to go slower to meet emission standards.  I believe that because of the associations formed by Zim,  their niche markets and because of the efficency  of their 25 new ships they will be able to earn $20 per share annually on a regular basis.   The current price of 51.94 is a bargain.More,Burnell,,18,2

Both DB and DAC have this incentive to sell and there are not many others, whom would move such a pile of stocks considering the cash incoming from divvy in Dec &amp; q1/22. DAC stated in one of their previous CC that they are about to sell ZIM in order to fund new ships. This would be logical and most likely guarantees hefty cash balance at the end of the year -》 easier to get cheap money with low interest from the markets.

3 months ago,Everyone knows why ESEA is arguably the superior long term play in this space between ZIM and ESEA, right? I grant that they are both super cheap, deep value stocks right here. But ESEA is the better long term play because, unlike ZIM of course, ESEA owns all its containerships. Actually owning all of those very valuable, highly desirable assets creates a superior, safer position to be in long term. With ESEA not only do you have fantastically earning assets, you actually own all of them and their values have been increasing very nicely. With ZIM, one thing is certain: they always will be paying very handsome rates to ship owners like ESEA but there is no guarantee that, in the future, the container rates will remain as sky high as they have been of late to cover the high ship rates and still generate such incredibly massive profits like ZIM has been enjoying. I will sacrifice some of those present massive profits of ZIM in favor of the long term safety and profit visibility earned by ESEA from actually owning all of the valuable containerships in its fleet. On top of all that, you are getting a fantastic entry point here in ESEA after the recent steep sell-off. Plus, Q4 earnings are going to be stellar, in part due to their incredible signing of a short term contract for one of their ships (a 4250 teu vessel) that has been in effect so far this quarter and has been earning 200,000/day for just that ship.$ESEA $ZIMMore,Value Finder,,0,0

Peaked up above $55 briefly a couple of times already, but they are doubling their effort to drive the price back down now.@ $55, those that have the money to exercise their options, may do it.........if so bye bye shares and bye bye dividend for those that sold the calls.,Kevin,,6,1

3 months ago,Correct me if I am wrong but this is how I understand the dividend.  They will pay 2.50 in December. In March or maybe April they will pay the annual30-50% dividend less the 2.50 paid in December. So if EPS are 36.83 for 2021, 30 per cent would be 11.04 so minimum dividend in March would be 8.54. I bet they up  to 10.00 which would be 12.50 for the year or about 34 per cent. If they earn 10.00 in Q1 2022 then June dividend would be 2.00 , 20 per cent of  first quarter earnings.,Burnell,,4,0

3 months ago,Zim's rates, revenues and profits will actually continue to climb.  They forward book somewhat and there is a lag for when the increases in the index are reflected in their earnings.  Plus the liners like ZIM are starting to book longer term rates at these higher prices.  ZIMs profits will actually continue to increase even after the peak index rates are reached for some time.  That they have paid off debt will offset the relatively minor contribution of increased vessel charter rates.  The amount of revenue they receive from the shippers is multiple times the cost of chartering, even at these higher charter rates.More,Chris,,5,0

Will they announce that tomorrow? My odds are about  33 per cent.  Even though DAC sold 1 million shares at 44 I dont think they will be satisfied with 50.  I would be happy if tomorrow they said they were purchasing 25 million shares at 55. I could even swallow 60.

How much sooner were they able to get the new builds by chartering versus buying? Maybe 2years?The charter payments for five years on the newbuilds are almost as much as the purchase price.  It must have been the delivery date,  They must have strong feelings that this size ship with limited availability for the next 5 to 7 years. Is it possible that one could use a ship this small (4300 TEUs ) to go into a small Asian port and then go to a small West Coast American port and avoid logjams and make a giant profit?More,Burnell,,3,0

3 months ago,I think we will get a better understanding of market psyche after earnings.  I was surprised with the with DAC after their earnings blowout and no response from the market.  I had expected around $55 going into earnings.  But a small div (30%, $10) would be a 20% return.  It is almost as if the market is looking at this as the top for container shipping and it is all downhill from here.  Maybe the GS price target of $46 has had more impact than what we thought??,Randall,,4,1

3 months ago,Always remember that the stock market is not efficient, therefore can't always be well priced.It is a strategy of finding undervalued companies and being patient enough to benefit from a 20-30% positive correction when new data appear and just make it 100% obvious that the stock is not valued correctly.,ZeusTheGreek,,11,1
