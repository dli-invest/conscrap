The realistic SP here should be over $200/share.  Div yield is above 14% which is only 35% of their net income and 33% of the FCF.  They could even raise the DIV.  The P/E average for the industry is 30.  Theirs is 2.2.  This is absolutely unheard of.  Very bullish.  In the shipping industry prices fluctuate all the time,,0,0

last month,In reply to Bullrun. Revenue has increased primarily because of higher rates. Industry volumes and rates were increasing prior to Covid. Covid shut down demand initially and shipbuilding. Zim has gone from 70 ships to about 110. Their business model has been to be flexible and to cut back unprofitable routes when rates are lower. Recent decisions reflect their desire to guarantee longer term ship availability. I think Zim  believes their customers need to know they can serve their long term needs.,Burnell,,0,0
last month,Anyone have a good size position in this company that is following it pretty closely ? I've done some initial DD and am looking to take a position next week. What I'm trying to figure out is if the huge jump in revenue from 2018-2020 they were in the 3 billion annual revenue. Then last year it exploded up to 8.6 billion. Is the huge jump in revenue something tied to the pandemic or is this something they are expecting to continue. If that drops back down to the 3 billion range the stock will of course crash back down.,BullRun,,0,0

last month,@Hardball I no longer own UNFI but as I was in at start of shutdown and shares tripled in price in short time so I sold.  I thinks it's fallen back below fair value as they'll do more than $4/shr this year so if it goes lower I may get back in .KOS is a flyer, looking for $7 price this year and then I'd move on.TGH is a steady long term double digit grower that will do well once earnings are announced and as they continue to increase dividend.I see ZIM as a $100 stock mid year but may retrace on ex-div date and because I hold all my shares in retirement accounts I may sell before ex-div as I have no way to reclaim the 25% Israel tax but I would look to re-enter after that.Good Luck.More,,0,0

2 months ago,I recommend visiting Zims website. Among other information one can find a schedule of their association arrivals and departures at a vast number of ports. For example there may be 10 ships leaving Tampa in the next two  weeks. One or two of those ships may belong  to Zim. The itinerary is to the same Mexican ports  and takes about 2 weeks when the ship returns to make the same trip again. It is thought that Zim has less contracted than do their competitors. If a customer contracted to ship on this route would he contract with Zim or with the association ?  How does somebody not in the association compete? I  can believe that rates on this route may be less in two years but do not believe overnight the association will be quoting unprofitable rates. Analysts base their projections on what has happened in the past. I believe the associations will have a large affect on future  profits.More,Burnell,,0,0

Kenon is largely owned by the the family that controlled Zim before Zim went public, Zim interests and Kenons interest are very closely aligned. It would seem stupid that Kenon would flood the market when price approaches 60 unless they are trying to keep the share price down so that Zim does not need to pay as much for their shares that they buy from Duetch Bank.

2 months ago,There is a parallel to draw between ZIM and SWA which years ago had that fixed dollar long term fuel cost contract that propelled the company from a low budget carrier into a the major carrier that they are today.  Right now ZIM has ship leases locked in at advantageous low historical prices compared to today's market value.  At the same time, per container rates remain sky high (at a time of the year that is perennially a low profit time for shippers).  Rates per container typically go up in spring and into summer which is the busiest time of the year for shipping companies.  ZIM can now take advantage of this over the next 10 to 12 months and build even more balance sheet strength which can position them to make all sorts of moves in the future (perhaps pivoting to a buying model with cash and no debt?).  When you have cash and minimal debt,,0,0

2 months ago,Too good to be true?  earnings per share this year are $24 per share so far with another $12 per share expected in the 4th quarter . That puts the PE at about 1.4 ..... Dividend policy changed to Fourth quarter dividend at a rate that the cumulative annual amount will total 30 - 50% of the annual net income expected to be paid in April 2022. If the 4th quarter is similar to the 3rd quarter that dividend ought to be about $12 per share ................... 2022 I would expect earnings in the $40 per share range and dividend total to be about $16 in 2022. That is assuming the market comes down some. If it stays as strong as the 3rd and 4th quarter of 2021 earnings of $50 per share is possible. What is not to like ? Am I missing something??

If  Credit Swiss did sell 7 million shares , does that mean they have another 7 million to sell?   Do you think they would take such a risk?  If their average selling price on the first 7 million was 58 they could come out by averaging 52.00 for the next 7 million. Maybe they could get Zim to buy like 5 million shares at 53.00.  It would not surprise me if they had not covered themselves somehow with such a deal.  How soon will we know what has happened?More,,0,0

A year from now they will have paid me $20 per share and have $40 cash per share. $20 cash is still worth $20 and a company that has $40 cash per share is worth at least $40 .

Kenron, DAC and DB were able to purchase  Zim shares at Zims inception for 7.00.  DAC and DB had a business relationship with Zim but I wonder what Zims connection was to Kenron.doesMore,,0,0

3 months ago,Correct me if I am wrong but this is how I understand the dividend.  They will pay 2.50 in December. In March or maybe April they will pay the annual30-50% dividend less the 2.50 paid in December. So if EPS are 36.83 for 2021, 30 per cent would be 11.04 so minimum dividend in March would be 8.54. I bet they up  to 10.00 which would be 12.50 for the year or about 34 per cent. If they earn 10.00 in Q1 2022 then June dividend would be 2.00 ,,0,0

Will they announce that tomorrow? My odds are about  33 per cent.  Even though DAC sold 1 million shares at 44 I dont think they will be satisfied with 50.  I would be happy if tomorrow they said they were purchasing 25 million shares at 55. I could even swallow 60.  I think they would pay 60 if they waited until January and then pre or post dividend becomes an issue. Do it now and reduce the number of shares getting dividend.More,,0,0

How much sooner were they able to get the new builds by chartering versus buying? Maybe 2years?The charter payments for five years on the newbuilds are almost as much as the purchase price.  It must have been the delivery date,  They must have strong feelings that this size ship with limited availability for the next 5 to 7 years. Is it possible that one could use a ship this small (4300 TEUs ) to go into a small Asian port and then go to a small West Coast American port and avoid logjams and make a giant profit?More,,0,0

I work closely in the container industry. Most these shippers were honoring a majority of their contracts at $1600-2000 this year since they are under contract and this coming year will be twice as high. Yes, the spot market has maybe peaked but if you have two years of contract pricing higher than this current year they will be earning so much money the market can't ignore how undervalued it is.,,0,0

Thats a 30% gain in two months! Of course there will be profit taking. Selling triggers stop losses. and it moves further down. Don't play their game. Earnings will be excellent. ZIM will retest highs. We are holding and will enjoy the rewards.  By the way, stop losses are a fools errand. They dont work in the aftermarket and you can sell at a far lower price. Use alerts instead. Then make an informed decision to hold or sell.do your due diligence and be careful out there. best of fortune to all.More,,0,0

Given that ports are all unionized and its a democratic goverment in place which is not making any infrastructure investments but just handing out money the congestion will stay. Newbuilds will be for replacement of old ships and account for additional demand and help with the backlogs at ports a bit.

Although rates will decrease into 1Q (like always), I expect rates to stabilize about halfway between current and the 2016-2019 levels…which will be very profitable for ZIM (and even DAC).
