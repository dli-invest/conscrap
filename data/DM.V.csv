I agree with Che, when AI contract are secured this will explode. With this income company will not have to do dilution of shares to raise revenue .

To Marshall's credit which he speaks modestly about is their control on costs with respect to growth.

("Medi-Call" or "Target"), an arm's length, British Columbia based private telemedicine company.The acquisition of Medi-Call was completed by way of a share exchange agreement dated June 18, 2021 between the Company, Medi-Call and the shareholders of Medi-Call (the "Share Exchange Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Medi-Call for an aggregate purchase price of $12 million satisfied through the issuance of 60,000,000 Units of the Company (the "Consideration Units") at a deemed price of $0.20 per Consideration Unit.Each Consideration Unit consists of one (1) common share in the capital of the Company (a "Consideration Share") and one (1) common share purchase warrant (a "ConsiderationWarrant"), each Consideration Warrant entitling holder to acquire one (1) common share in the capital of the Corporation at an exercise price of $0.26 per share for a period of twenty-four (24) months from date of issuance.As a result of the acquisition, Medi-Call is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.Issuance of the Consideration Units and its underlying securities shall be subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals including, without limitation, the final approval of the TSX Venture Exchange ("TSXV") and other conditions.Datametrex has not assumed any debt of Medi-Call and the proposed acquisition will not constitute a fundamental change or result in a change of business for the Company, nor is it expected to result in a change of control of the Company within the meaning of applicable securities laws and defined in the polices of the TSXV.Dr. Omar Sharif, President of Medi-Call Inc. stated: "This is an exciting development for Medi-Call and with the global impact of COVID-19 has been unprecedented, resulting in telemedicine witnessing a massive demand, it made sense to team up with a larger company to roll out more services and locations in BC and eventually across Canada. The demand for multi billion-dollar digital health services has emerged as a powerful new business and healthcare model for doctors like me in assessing patients quickly and efficiently but is also aiding in reducing the cost burden to regional health authorities. I look forward to driving the telemedicine business with help of the team at Datametrex."Marshall Gunter, CEO of the Company, stated: "The past 18 months with the pandemic has transformed our behavioural habits related to our health and well being and including seeing a doctor. With the acquisition of Medi-Call comes the addition of key medical staff and enhanced capability in the field of online medicine. With the increased capacity to screen patients, on an online basis for underlying health issues prior to undertaking an ER visit in a hospital, Medi-Call is furthering its commitment to patients that require immediate acute assessment or frequent visits to a doctor's office for consultation for underlying conditions. With today's tech-savvy generation, preference towards the adoption of online shopping and services, the delivery for online medical consultation is on the surge."About Medi-CallMedi-Call is a telemedicine company providing technology driven e-health or m-health care services including prescriptions, launching initially in British Columbia, and then expanding across Canada. The objectives of Medi-Call, include making health care accessible to people who live in rural or isolated communities and make services more readily available or convenient for people with limited time, mobility, or transportation choices.

3 months ago,I been a long time holder of this stock. I accumulated over the last year a nice amount. I seen Datametrex go from struggling to get by and keep the doors open, to making $9 mil profit in 3 months. I bought for the Ai tech but got lucky and caught the Covid test side. Hats off to the management team for having the vision to develop a market  for their test kid connections. DM has an unlimited supply of kits for the general public. New viruses? The business model the team has put together is amazing. To land contracts with AirCanada the film, mining, and travel industries says it all. I can‚Äôt wait to see the Ai drones come to market. Ladies and gents, their is your global government contracts. Once the value of this company catches up to the share price, it will be in the dollar range as long as no dilution takes place. Which it shouldn‚Äôt they made 9 mil last qtr. this little company can‚Äôt stay under the radar to long. I‚Äôm very bullish on the company. Cheers$More,Tony,,0,0

3 months ago,Since I've been following DM, I've been listening closely to Marshall.  He's acknowledged that the Covid test kits kind of fell into their lap and decided to take advantage of the opportunity to generate profits to fund the AI side of their business.  A great strategy to grow the business without dilution in my opinion.  To be disappointed in falling AI revenue is an unreal shareholder expectation.  Countries and Companies have been hit with incredibly high costs to get Covid 19 under control so why would anyone be surprised that there was less money to spend on utilizing AI in any country or business.  I think it was a very smart move to pivot and take advantage the massive sales and profits test kits provided.  Not to mention their contribution to help get this pandemic under control.  If you have any disappointment at all in DM's performance, it is your lack of due diligence that has caused it not DM's lack of execution.  They have done exactly as they said they would due.  And to massive reward I might add.Marshall has indicated in his last Agoracom interview that the AI business is starting to pick up and that they'll have some announcements about it in the very near future.  He also indicated that the Covid test kit business is still very strong so you may as well resign yourself to the fact that AI revenue will grow but test kits will grow far more and will be more revenue than AI by many fold.  And, sorry to disappoint you, but the test kits will provide huge profits; likely in Q2 and Q3.  We'll have to see what he says about Q4 when we get a little closer. Marshall is one the the most Credible CEO's I've seen and will take DM to the moon.  It will happen much sooner if people would do their research, judge DM base on DM's execution of DM's goals and objective not some unknown objective of a few shareholders.More,Brad,,0,0

4 months ago,There appears to be a common thread of confusion here, but Datametrex is just getting warmed up. Listen to ceo Marshall Gunter in his recent interview on Agoracom, join Discord for his Q and A every Monday or email him with your questions to get the DM story straight, if needed. As for Q1 earnings, Marshall explains  on Agoracom the reason for the temporary decrease of AI earnings is basically due to client budget cuts during the pandemic. Practically every company on the planet had income loss of some sort this past year, but DM saw a way to profit, with a windfall of cash from the sale of covid test kits. These unexpected millions will put DM back on the map in a big way, including acquisitions and hiring a PR team and the best new talent, which is underway right now. As for the test-kit cash, it's ongoing into Q2 and possibly beyond, until covid 19 is behind us, which, science says, unfortunately may never happen completely.More,Lorna,,17,1

4 months ago,Many of you are completely off with your logic, so I decided to share my genius mind with you knuckleheads:- Vaccines do NOT prevent covid breakouts.- DM gets most of their money from the covid testing kits from the mining and filming industry. Paying for the tests is peanuts for them in comparison to being shut down because of a breakout. - The CEO has mentioned that the testing keeps accelerating and that he is not worried about a slowdown in the near future, but he will communicate it if there are signs. This means you sissies should stop worrying.- The burn rate for companies like DM is high (tech/AI industry) hence having an extra pile of cash provides them with the following:1. Being able to hire more talent which will increase the quality of the product plus speed up the progress of development (CEO mentioned this)2. It gives them the ability to acquire more companies, which is very common in this industry. This allows them to bypass certain stages of their development and/or further extend their audience/application for their core product3. This extra money also means they won't have to raise any additional funds for their core business which is usually common as well in this industry, so most likely no diluting or loans in the foreseeable future- We also just had recent acquisitions which are in the progress of being integrated into their core business, hence more improvements and announcements to come in the near future- We just got another ~500k AI contract which came in after Q1 which means we are still doing well in terms of AI business in terms of the year 2021- DM basically helped out the CAD government by handling the import of the covid testing kits which means DM built good relationships with both, the Canadian and South Korean government. This could come in handy in the future and bring additional businessThis stock is going above $1 at some point this year. My chart technical analysis points to it as well. This drop is just a smaller degree wave 2 correction.Keep selling, I am buying all I can.More,Lynn,,43,0

4 months ago,This is just me thinking out loud here.with testing for any virus, infection or condition, it‚Äôs always better to test and rule things in and out in order to reach an accurate diagnosis. The correct diagnosis is key to effective treatment, and so if someone ever seeks medical advice with the symptoms of coronavirus, it makes sense to test them for it. The future of covid testing is far from over I‚Äôm thinking. And another thought that comes into my mind waiting for Monday is that there‚Äôs a lot of people that I talk to in Canada and the USA that aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated, which‚Äôs leads me to believe that those people would be required to get tested to travel, go to Concerts and sporting eventsÔøºÔøº no?

4 months ago,atametrex sues over "double-deleted" accounting dataDatametrex AI Ltd (C:DM)Shares Issued 292,769,034Last Close 5/13/2021 $0.23Thursday May 13 2021 - Street Wireby Mike CaswellDatametrex AI Ltd., a cyber-security promotion trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange, has filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of British Columbia against a former accountant, Jihyun Son. The company claims that Ms. Son abruptly left her job and "double deleted" the company's accounting files. Her departure was particularly damaging, as it came in the midst of an audit, the suit states.The allegations are contained in a brief notice of claim that Datametrex filed against Ms. Son at the Vancouver courthouse on April 28, 2021. The lawsuit identifies Ms. Son as a former senior manager who was responsible for accounting functions that included receivables, payables and payroll. Her employment agreement specified that she would serve the company "faithfully and loyally" and would act in its best interests.The problems, as set out in the suit, began on March 25, 2021, when Ms. Son resigned her job with no warning, in the midst of an audit. She provided the company with two weeks of notice, but refused to work during that two-week period, the suit states. Adding to the trouble, Datametrex says that it quickly discovered it was unable to access the files Ms. Son had been using. She had not been saving them on the corporate server, instead keeping them on a company laptop that remained in her possession.The company later retrieved the laptop, but Ms. Son initially refused to provide the password, the suit states. When she did provide the password, the company discovered that the files had been "double deleted." (It is not quite clear what Datametrex means by this term, but it is clear from the lawsuit that the company was unable to retrieve all of its data.)As Datametrex sees things, Ms. Son's actions were deliberate and were designed to harm the company. The company was relying on her assistance and on having access to the files during the audit. The company says that the files are not entirely lost however, as Ms. Son still has copies of them, which she wrongfully transferred to her own devices.The suit seeks appropriate damages and the court orders necessary to secure the files at issue. In particular, Datametrex is asking that a judge order Ms. Son to hire a third party to create a copy of all the files in her possession and securely delete the files from her devices.Vancouver lawyer Ryan Berger of Lawson Lundell LLP filed the suit on behalf of Datametrex. Ms. Son has yet to file a response.In the markets, Datametrex is an active trader, with the company touting a COVID-19 test on top of its cyber-security offerings. The stock closed at 23 cents Thursday, up a cent.¬© 2021 Canjex Publishing Ltd.More,Eyal,,6,0

4 months ago,Here's my short-term (quarterly) analysis and why I'm bullish on Datametrex. Please let me know if there's anything I've missed or if you see flaws in my logic. I might be completely nuts so take this with a grain of salt.Fundamental Analysis: As per the Agoracom interview.Last quarter, Datametrex had an increase in operational expenses. This has been explained by Marshall as cashless investments back into Datametrex maintain and build talent through the form of options issuance. etc. "The best people are our number one asset." Without these losses, the ballpark net loss will be roughly $800,000 or roughly a 65% reduction. Q1 results are being conducted by an independent auditor and are expected to be in Mid to End of May.Technical Analysis:The 1-year day chart is showing signs of a large rising pennant formation from January 5th to Today with an RSI rating of 37 near the oversold threshold. These are two bullish signals. Average volume has declined since March making way for a potential breakout. May 10th to 12th show a potential morning star signal as well.The 1-year hourly chart shows recent flirting between the 50 and 200-day moving averages with a death cross occurring on the 11th of May. If we follow the pattern of this interplay we should be expecting a golden cross between now and the end of May, which is in alignment with the estimated Q1 earnings report date.In conclusion, macroeconomics aside, I'm expecting a breakout soon with a price testing the upper resistance level of .35. If we break past .35 we might see a new ATH.Cheers.More,DangerFrog,,30,0

5 months ago,I want to tip my hat to all who is in this stock at these levels. If DM had one of those aggressive PR Marketing firms on our side, we could be sitting at $3 short term.  Back when covid first started I searched for a company or test kit manufacturer to buy stock in. DM had no intentions of getting into covid testing but I'm glad they did. Now we have a very diversified Ai company on our hands here. Company needs to gain some notoriety and public awareness that could potentially bring in more business with testing sites all over North America. Lets get a cruise line contract guys! Set up some satellite test portals at port of calls. There is so much untapped testing applications we can do. I understand it takes time to build out the infrastructure to do such a task, but in time it will come.    I been in this over a year and have a large holding. I don't pump the stocks I own. I buy them for the potential value they have. DM is creating strong value and the public doesn't even have a clue. I have many friends invested here as well. They will make some nice gains and so will everyone here that owns shares of DM.More,Tony,,0,0

5 months ago,I have personally talked to Marshall about company growth. Covid test are good for short term revenue but the real value of company is in it AI platform which has been proven many times with major companies. There are so many applications and business that can benefit from their technology.  So much data now must be analyzed and only AI can do it with ROI results. DTMXF is in the perfect position to capitalize on this trend. Their AI has been proven with the Canadian military. Very high repete use from companies once they use the AI platform. Earning report soon  to be release will be very strong. Cathy Wood of ARK investments said AI would be one of the leading disruptive areas with massive growth in the future. Market cap of only 64 million , so much growth  to come. Stock should be above 1 before end of year. Company is looking at many areas for revenue streams with their AI platform.More,Hunter,,0,0
