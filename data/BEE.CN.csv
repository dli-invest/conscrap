2 months ago,Wow sure quiet around here lately.This is dated July 30. Letter from ceo "we are very pleased with the commercialization progress that was made in the 2021 season over the 2020 season (our inaugural year for commercialization in the US). This year we opened six new crop/geographic markets, retained 100% of our customer base in Georgia (which is our largest market thus far) and added new customers in Georgia, Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon, and Washington â€“ plus secured new trials in California where BVT just received regulatory approval in January;",john,,3,2

3 months ago,What would be really interesting as a "down the road" enterprise, would be a hornet package that would target invasive insects that damage food and timber crops.  They worked with University of North Dakota on the sunflower rollout as per today's news. They could work with a number of universities and colleges to identify wasp species and potential fungicidal delivery processes to target invasive insects like emerald ash borer, various oak boarers, and potentially/hopefully the growing threats of Spotted Lanternfly in Pennsylvania that is threatening grapes, apples, and hardwood species.    This might be a platform for eventually selling product to farmers and landowners/timber growers/municipalities for control of biological invasives.

last year,The European patent grant (Patent Number EP3044307B1) recognizes the unique properties of BVTâ€™s proven CR-7 strain as a plant-beneficial microbe that offers natural control of various plant diseases. It also protects CR-7 independently of its use as a biologic control agent vectored by bees, enabling the Company to also develop revenue streams in foliar sprays and seed treatments in the well-established traditional global fungicide market.The current global fungicides market is valued at US$18.7 billion and projected to grow to US$24.5 billion by 2025(2). This growth is due to increased demand for food security by a growing population, advances in farming practices and techniques, and changing climate conditions that lead to disease. Fungicides are used to destroy harmful fungi that affect crop yields.More,Malik,,1,0

2 years ago,News out. BVT announced Sizemore Farms, a top-tier grower of Florida strawberries, as the first commercial grower deal for their newly US EPA-registered product, VECTORITEâ„¢ with CR-7. The BVT system uses commercially-managed bees to carry its all natural plant protection product, VECTORITEâ„¢ with CR-7, directly to key areas of target plants â€“ using significantly less product than traditional spray applications and reducing water and fossil fuel consumption.Sizemore Farms will be using the Companyâ€™s proprietary bee delivery system and VECTORITEâ„¢ with CR-7 on 100% of their 62-acre organic strawberry crop this season and is considering testing the naturally-derived fungicide on a portion of their 600+ conventional acres for possible implementation on next year's crop. Typically, growers start with a pilot on a smaller crop before progressively adopting it across their entire operation over two to three seasons. This progressive adoption and deployment of BVT product season over season is to be expected with the Companyâ€™s customer base of growers and farmers.More,Dulu,,3,10
