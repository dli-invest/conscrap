2 months ago,FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS:The Company has also made strong progress in key financial metrics: Revenue of $400,000 which represents a year-on-year growth of +47% using constant currency (US$/CAD$) exchange rates for FY2021 and FY2020. As reported, revenue growth is +38% since the CAD strengthened in 2021 as compared to 2020.Gross margins improved from 39% in FY2020 to 42% in FY2021. This improvement was driven by lower cost of production of BVT’s Clonostachys rosea strain BVT CR-7 and the introduction of the higher margin honeybee solution. Cash on hand of $2.7 million. The strong cash balance allows the Company to continue executing its growth plan as we enter 2022. The Company continues to focus on operational efficiency and cash management as evident by a reduction of cash used by operations from $3.67 million in FY2020 to $2.85 million in FY2021.More,Shawn,,4,0

2 months ago,RETRANSMISSION: Bee Vectoring Technologies and BioSafe Systems Sign Memorandum of Understanding on Multi-Faceted Business CollaborationsNewsfile CorpMississauga, Ontario; Sacramento, California; and East Hartford, Connecticut--(Newsfile Corp. - January 12, 2022) - Bee Vectoring Technologies International Inc. (CSE: BEE) (OTCQB: BEVVF) (CVE: BEE) ("BVT") and BioSafe Systems, LLC ("BioSafe") today jointly announced they have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) where the companies have agreed to enter into detailed discussions on multiple business partnership projects that call upon each other's expertise. BioSafe and BVT are both leaders in the agricultural biologicals industry with a similar customer base, and offer services and products that are complementary to one another.The projects will enable both companies to expand each other's product offerings, markets, and customer base. Opportunities include pairing BioSafe biologicals with BVT's bee vectoring system, and using BVT's Clonostachys rosea CR-7 (CR-7) strain for non-bee-vectoring applications. Specific agreements in these areas will follow after evaluations and more detailed discussions on business terms.BioSafe has a 23-year history as an innovator of environmentally sustainable products and has a team of 100 people across the US, Mexico, Canada, and into South America. BioSafe serves a broad customer base in the Agriculture, Horticulture, Post Harvest/Food Safety, Aquatics, Home and Garden, Turf, and Commercial/Industrial Sanitation markets.BVT has pioneered a natural precision agriculture system proven to replace chemical pesticides and wasteful plant protection product spray applications by delivering biological pesticide alternatives to crops using commercially managed bees while increasing crop yields. BVT has also been testing and is seeing positive results for the use of its proprietary CR-7 strain in foliar and soil applications."We are excited to announce this inaugural arrangement with an industry partner that is a leader in biological products," said Ashish Malik, CEO of BVT. "Our strategy is to build partnerships with established partners to accelerate our growth and broaden our customer reach. Therefore, being able to attract the attention of an industry leader such as BioSafe validates that our technology is gaining momentum among growers and in the market. BioSafe's multi-market and multi-channel focus will help BVT accelerate growth and maximize shareholder value.""We are excited about the potential to work closely with such an innovative company like BVT. Our target markets are the same, and we share similar missions and beliefs," said Rob Larose, President and CEO of BioSafe Systems. "The mission of BioSafe Systems is to provide disease control solutions utilizing reduced-risk chemistries that do not negatively impact the health and safety of people and the environment. We only develop, manufacture, and promote products that meet our standards of environmentalism and sustainability, and BVT perfectly meets these key criteria."More,Malik,,6,0

8 months ago,What would be really interesting as a "down the road" enterprise, would be a hornet package that would target invasive insects that damage food and timber crops.  They worked with University of North Dakota on the sunflower rollout as per today's news. They could work with a number of universities and colleges to identify wasp species and potential fungicidal delivery processes to target invasive insects like emerald ash borer, various oak boarers, and potentially/hopefully the growing threats of Spotted Lanternfly in Pennsylvania that is threatening grapes, apples, and hardwood species.    This might be a platform for eventually selling product to farmers and landowners/timber growers/municipalities for control of biological invasives.

2 years ago,The European patent grant (Patent Number EP3044307B1) recognizes the unique properties of BVT’s proven CR-7 strain as a plant-beneficial microbe that offers natural control of various plant diseases. It also protects CR-7 independently of its use as a biologic control agent vectored by bees, enabling the Company to also develop revenue streams in foliar sprays and seed treatments in the well-established traditional global fungicide market.The current global fungicides market is valued at US$18.7 billion and projected to grow to US$24.5 billion by 2025(2). This growth is due to increased demand for food security by a growing population, advances in farming practices and techniques, and changing climate conditions that lead to disease. Fungicides are used to destroy harmful fungi that affect crop yields.More,Malik,,1,0

2 years ago,News out. BVT announced Sizemore Farms, a top-tier grower of Florida strawberries, as the first commercial grower deal for their newly US EPA-registered product, VECTORITE™ with CR-7. The BVT system uses commercially-managed bees to carry its all natural plant protection product, VECTORITE™ with CR-7, directly to key areas of target plants – using significantly less product than traditional spray applications and reducing water and fossil fuel consumption.Sizemore Farms will be using the Company’s proprietary bee delivery system and VECTORITE™ with CR-7 on 100% of their 62-acre organic strawberry crop this season and is considering testing the naturally-derived fungicide on a portion of their 600+ conventional acres for possible implementation on next year's crop. Typically, growers start with a pilot on a smaller crop before progressively adopting it across their entire operation over two to three seasons. This progressive adoption and deployment of BVT product season over season is to be expected with the Company’s customer base of growers and farmers.More,Dulu,,3,10
