6 hours ago,Bought 50000 shares of BEE today. Like all startups it is risky and will take time to become profitable; but the technology is promising and so environmentally friendly it will very likely be a big winner once they start generating significant revenue. Prepared to hold it for a few years.,stpicker,,0,0

2 months ago,Think about it people... r and d has been fleshed out. The proof is in the pudding. 15-40% better yields means better profits for farmers. This is easy math here. The agriculture sector needs this more than they know it, but this summer they will finally discover why. California will be the red carpet walk for BEE and I will be flying high with them. Super stock in the making. Yeah not much volume right now but just wait for those results from contract sales. The recurring rev... the reputation building... better tasting food. All pros all gold!,Dylan,,0,0

6 months ago,Do like the ingenuity concept of this company.Actually was the very first stock I bought after getting back in after being out many years.Ended up selling it for a few pennies profit. Realized wasn't progressive. The stock is artificially held up to this price point.And it's a seasonal business...maybe rebuy at this price next year.More,Knowfoolin,,0,0

8 months ago,The European patent grant (Patent Number EP3044307B1) recognizes the unique properties of BVTâ€™s proven CR-7 strain as a plant-beneficial microbe that offers natural control of various plant diseases. It also protects CR-7 independently of its use as a biologic control agent vectored by bees, enabling the Company to also develop revenue streams in foliar sprays and seed treatments in the well-established traditional global fungicide market.The current global fungicides market is valued at US$18.7 billion and projected to grow to US$24.5 billion by 2025(2). This growth is due to increased demand for food security by a growing population, advances in farming practices and techniques, and changing climate conditions that lead to disease. Fungicides are used to destroy harmful fungi that affect crop yields.More,Malik,,1,0

last year,hey have a lot of warrant outstanding. Also turn over of 50 k last quarter vs. m 2.8 costs is very dangerous. they must reach 60 x higher revenue for break even. they also say that they will/must issue more common shares in the future... so shareholders will pay salaries, marketing, patent registration (all costs) until company reaches break even in maybe 2022.,Heinz,,3,0

last year,News out. BVT announced Sizemore Farms, a top-tier grower of Florida strawberries, as the first commercial grower deal for their newly US EPA-registered product, VECTORITEâ„¢ with CR-7. The BVT system uses commercially-managed bees to carry its all natural plant protection product, VECTORITEâ„¢ with CR-7, directly to key areas of target plants â€“ using significantly less product than traditional spray applications and reducing water and fossil fuel consumption.Sizemore Farms will be using the Companyâ€™s proprietary bee delivery system and VECTORITEâ„¢ with CR-7 on 100% of their 62-acre organic strawberry crop this season and is considering testing the naturally-derived fungicide on a portion of their 600+ conventional acres for possible implementation on next year's crop. Typically, growers start with a pilot on a smaller crop before progressively adopting it across their entire operation over two to three seasons. This progressive adoption and deployment of BVT product season over season is to be expected with the Companyâ€™s customer base of growers and farmers.More,Dulu,,3,10
