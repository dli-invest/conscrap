16 March, 2022,I expect FGI to do well with earnings. Last year's growth was SOLID, as in +200% EPS. They run a tight margin and have debt, but it is well covered. I seriously expect they will keep on track or better, and they are already deeply undervalued. So, seeing a price of $9+ this year would not surprise ...See more,Always Right,,4,0

3 months ago,BTW. TP by analyst is around 7-8... AT least they got that right...Based on R=185M and assume fair MC of  92.5M (half Rev) gets you  PPS =92.5/12.05 = 7.67.  Analyst has 7 and 7.5 TP.

5 months ago,A lot of insider buying on April 1st. Glad to see management has considerable skin in the game. The PE looks incredibly low considering the large revenue numbers, but their margins are way too tight. And based on the FY2021 call there are going to be a lot of headwinds throughout 2022 related to shipping congestion and inflation. I think I may stay on the sidelines for now until they can prove they can scale the business and increase margins.,,0,0

5 months ago,Two equities research analysts have issued 12 month price objectives for FGI Industries' shares. Their forecasts range from $7.00 to $8.50. On average, they anticipate FGI Industries' share price to reach $7.75 in the next year. This suggests a possible upside of 93.3% from the stock's current price. And look what Simply Wall Street says it is worth...$10.19. It trades at a forward P/E of 5...the average for the Trade Distributors industry is 14x. Marketwatch anticipates a nice average EPS increase...from .60 in 2021 to .69 in 2022 and .81 in 2023. That's a 15% EPS increase this year and then a 17% increase on top of that.What's a good PT for FGI? A lot more than the current SP. We closed at $4.86 on 31 January. Touched $6.25 that day.
