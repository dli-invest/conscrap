3 hours ago,I hold high respect for your work mate because you're pointing people in the right direction. If there's one thing I've learnt recently is to remain calm especially when it comes to investment in cryptocurrency.I advise everyone to forget predictions and start making profit now because future valuations are all speculations and guesses. The trade market is unstable and as a beginner, you can't easily tell if it's going bullish or bearish.While myself and my colleagues are trading without fear of incurring loses, other are being patient for the price of skyrocket. It all depends on the pattern you follow.Thanks to Mrs Debra j.Hanson for her trading tips, i'm not mistaken when I say she's the best...For those who want to connect with her, this is her contact‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è...Contact her for guidance on FacebooküëâüëâDebra j.

13 hours ago,I love checking back on this ticker and seeing how right I was. This has delisting potential. Dont listen to the pumpers on this thread, they're either trapped in this junk or they want to trap you in it. This company has nothing going for it and people aren't interested in it.,Fiss,,0,0
2 days ago,MMs beating on PPS....Wow MC is 15% of Rev.  Typically company going BK gets this kind of valuation....No chance here.  Call it micro super value.

9 days ago,BTW. TP by analyst is around 7-8... AT least they got that right...Based on R=185M and assume fair MC of  92.5M (half Rev) gets you  PPS =92.5/12.05 = 7.67.  Analyst has 7 and 7.5 TP.  Right in the ball park...Should see better numbers in coming quarter...BTW, takeover is always possible with such low valuation, but highly unlikely until stock is firmly entrenched in the market.

9 days ago,They hinted STRONGLY that there is either a major new customer or a new brand in the wings...such that it will disrupt their ability to concentrate on an aquisition and will likely slide that to next year.

16 days ago,I was looking at the website for Eidelman Virant Capital, FGI's biggest institutional holder. Do you agree with their investment philosophy? They feel FGI fits the bill:"Tenets ‚Äì Focus on companies with:‚Ä¢ Advantaged Businesses‚Ä¢ Outstanding management and corporate culture‚Ä¢ Customer experience focused‚Ä¢ Return Potential‚Ä¢ Downside Protection"Check out their thoughts on "Return Potential" specifically, here:https://www.eidelmanvirant.com/investment-approach/philosophy/value-investing/These guys clearly know what they are invested in, and I think FGI will do well for all of us as this plays out.

24 days ago,The headwind for $FGI is shippings costs, and those are dropping. They do have debt, for sure, but they are in the black. They have a bevy of strong customers (Home Depot, Lowes, etc) and they are growing their house brands nicely and dipping their toes into new product lines.   I think the question is, is a dependable profit margin (albeit narrow) a strong plus in this market? And, provided they have that base to build from, can they tailor the operation to broaden the margin and the value proposition?   They were split from Foremost specifically because Foremost thought that the division could grow faster on its own. That's why Foremost did it...and Foremost has been in the business for a long time and has confidence in the strategy.   What I see here is a really strong foundation to build the business on. And a REALLY good SP to get in on. 3x this SP would still be solid...check out any analyst or Simply Wall Street (which pegs fair value at $15.78!).More,Always Right,,1,1

2 months ago,A lot of insider buying on April 1st. Glad to see management has considerable skin in the game. The PE looks incredibly low considering the large revenue numbers, but their margins are way too tight. And based on the FY2021 call there are going to be a lot of headwinds throughout 2022 related to shipping congestion and inflation. I think I may stay on the sidelines for now until they can prove they can scale the business and increase margins.,Dennis McCullough,,0,0

2 months ago,Pricing is laughably cheap. I can only assume somebody is playing games to lower price and shake out some shares. It is not hard, with this float. Seriously, with about $50k, you could move it a dime, then scoop the sweet innards. We are being played, and the only thing for it is to hold and watch, confident in the underlying value. This will rise dramatically when the time comes, and these prices will not be touched again,,Always Right,,3,1

2 months ago,Flashback: watch this pre-IPO video to see why this guy thought FGI would go way above $7. Aside from launching into a terrible market at the time, I see no negative that justifies our current price. If the earnings trend holds, earnings on Monday should support a major rise in price. And frankly, even BAD news does not explain the current SP. This company is deeply underpriced, all games and hyperbole aside.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlv0IQeitlU,Always Right,,2,0

Honestly, anybody who thinks this stock will drop and stay there pre- or post-earnings needs a doc. This is solid where we are, with a lot of potential for rise.  What's worse than holding a lot of shares is realizing you could have held more...on Tuesday. I believe these opportunities need to be seized. It's what separates the investor hobbyists from the "lucky" ones. But this isn't luck. It's solid sense paired with conviction and focused for maximal effect.

2 months ago,FGI = F'n Great Investment.   Looking forward to next week. Earnings is not just a one-trick thing. If this were to drop on earnings, sanity should catch it quick and the reverse to the upside be jarring. And if it rockets, momentum could spike it wildly high. Earnings are an excuse for examination of the stock...and if you have done DD on this, you know that seeing its strengths will please a lot of people.

2 months ago,Two equities research analysts have issued 12 month price objectives for FGI Industries' shares. Their forecasts range from $7.00 to $8.50. On average, they anticipate FGI Industries' share price to reach $7.75 in the next year. This suggests a possible upside of 93.3% from the stock's current price. And look what Simply Wall Street says it is worth...$10.19. It trades at a forward P/E of 5...the average for the Trade Distributors industry is 14x. Marketwatch anticipates a nice average EPS increase...from .60 in 2021 to .69 in 2022 and .81 in 2023. That's a 15% EPS increase this year and then a 17% increase on top of that.What's a good PT for FGI? A lot more than the current SP. We closed at $4.86 on 31 January. Touched $6.25 that day. I fully expect us to test and pass that shortly. We should see 7-8 shortly, possibly before earnings. Great earnings could give this a big boost past that, just given the market momentum at the moment.Am I being wildly optimistic? I think I am being REALISTIC under optimal circumstances. And I think we are experiencing optimal circumstances. So far, the chart bears this out. The broader market could become a drag if risk/growth sentiment shifts. That said, as we have earnings coming, this may disconnect us and get us at least into a 7+ scenario.Just one fellow's opinion.More,Always Right,,5,1

2 months ago,I expect FGI to do well with earnings. Last year's growth was SOLID, as in +200% EPS. They run a tight margin and have debt, but it is well covered.
