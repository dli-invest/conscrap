(“DeFi Yield Technologies”), a company that has a proprietary automated yield engine that has made investing in decentralized finance (“DeFi”) simple and leverages different DeFi protocols and strategies to increase diversification, maximize yield, while minimizing exposure to risk.The Company has acquired 563,380 shares in DeFi Yield Technologies at a price of $0.71 per share. Sheldon Inwentash, Chairman and CEO of ThreeD, has also agreed to become an advisor to DeFi Yield Technologies.“We are excited to have ThreeD Capital as an investor and Sheldon Inwentash joining as an advisor. ThreeD and Sheldon Inwentash have a long track of investing in early stage companies and will help us scale the technology aiming to bring over 1 billion USD onto the platform in the near future.” said Philipp Kallerhoff, CEO of DeFi Yield Technologies.“Investing in decentralized finance can be complicated and it is easy to lose money if you do not know what you are doing. This makes it extremely difficult for DeFi to make it into the mainstream. DeFi Yield Technologies is reinventing financial services by building financial applications that allow anyone to invest and earn a return without having to understand all the different protocols and strategies.” said Sheldon Inwentash.More,appie,,3,0
last year,ThreeD Capital Inc. (“ThreeD” or the “Company”) (CSE:IDK / OTCQX:IDKFF) announced today its intention to effect a normal course issuer bid through the facilities of the Canadian Securities Exchange.Pursuant to the normal course issuer bid, ThreeD may, during the 12 month period commencing July 21, 2021 and ending July 20, 2022, purchase on the Canadian Securities Exchange up to 2,316,827 common shares in total, representing approximately 5% of the common shares currently issued and outstanding.

The actual number of common shares which may be purchased and the timing of any such purchases will be determined by ThreeD. The Company has retained Echelon Wealth Partners to effect purchases on its behalf pursuant to the bid. ThreeD is effecting the bid at this time as it believes that its common shares are undervalued at their current market prices and that the purchase of common shares would be a prudent use of funds.ThreeD previously repurchased for cancellation 673,500 common shares at an average price of approximately $0.265 per share pursuant to a normal course issuer bid that existed over a 12 month period expiring July 14, 2021.More,appie,,5,0

last year,ThreeD Capital NAV Climbs To $1.27 and stock price drops 25% from Early March $1 price to now .76. The fact that IDKFF has a major stake in PKKFF which will list on Nasdaq in early April baffles me. NAV will explode in the few quarters just from this one investment in PKKFF. PKKFF is expected to be a 100 x stock by end of year. Sheldon has a long track record of picking major stocks before anyone else finds them. NAV of this stock should be at least 2 x value. Sheldon is so confident he is listing NAV on a monthly basis. Sheldon is a independent director Strategic Advisor of PKKFF. These 2 stocks are some of the most undervalued company's on OTC. Sheldon is the real deal. I call him the Warren Buffet of Canada. His insight helped me find PKKFF-PYR-HPQFF-MVMDF -DTMXF.

last year,Everyone, please do not believe that IDK is shorting CBDT. I have holdings in both companies and have reasons to believe this is a coordinated attack against both companies by the same shorters.Reasons:1- IDK are interested in psychedelics and it would make more sense to partner with CBDT than it would to destroy them. They could and would buy warrants. Not short. 2- CBDT and MTRX are MAJOR partners and IDK are on the board of MTRX Rob and Steve are friends. Sheldon would NOT betray RobMore,Allan,,0,0

last year,Hello fellow investors. I have done some DD on this company and cannot believe the price of the stock now at $1.22  I would not be surprised if Sheldon is buying his own stock back at these levels. The NAV was at .90 more than 1 month ago. When Sheldon was at Pinecrest the company traded at 2X NAV which factored in domeof the value add of getting in before the tip of the iceberg. He has planted many seeds since last NAV. And the companies he as invested in are starting to realize their business plans. This stock I belive could easily be a mutibagger before the end of the year. Buy as much as you can at these levels. You won't see it again.More,Barry,,4,0

I like the kinds of things they are investing in, and recently bought shares to go long with it.  Very bullish on this and expectations are high.More,Nobs,,0,0
