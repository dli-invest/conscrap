3 months ago,For those considering this company, the more I learn about them the more bullish I am on this stock taking off, and bar chart showing this as a buy supported by recent uptick in share price.  Due your own DD, but why IDK?  It provides investors with significant exposure to ground floor opportunities in;	â€¢	Small cap stocks in their very early stages;	â€¢	Disruptive Technologies	â€¢	Junior Resourcesâ€¦emphasis on precious metalsthat would otherwise be impossible for 99% of investors to participate in.&nbsp; Ares of their investments includes;	â€¢	Esports	â€¢	Renewable Technology	â€¢	Blockchain	â€¢	Artificial Intelligence	â€¢	Internet of Things	â€¢	Junior Resources 	â€¢	NanotechnologyIt is in early stage investments in companies I canâ€™t find myself nor have the time to research endlessly to locate, proven investors in the company look after the risk, and the value of that portfolio is expected to result in major share price growth of IDK.   I like the kinds of things they are investing in, and recently bought shares to go long with it.  Very bullish on this and expectations are high.More,Nobs,3MonthsAgo,0,0
