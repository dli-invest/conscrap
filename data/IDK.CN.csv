4 days ago,Anybody else but me watching this stock finally head towards NAV. it is so undervalued. Sheldon has 60 companies under his wing. These are starting to realize their biz plans. Buy and HODL.  You won't see these legs ever again.,Barry,,4,0

27 days ago,Load up before NAV for March becomes public. Sheldon is a wizard at picking companies to invest.   These companies need some time to realize their marketing and business plans and will surely increase in value. Invest now and hold. I am sure you will be rewarded.,Barry,,6,0

last month,ThreeD Capital NAV Climbs To $1.27 and stock price drops 25% from Early March $1 price to now .76. The fact that IDKFF has a major stake in PKKFF which will list on Nasdaq in early April baffles me. NAV will explode in the few quarters just from this one investment in PKKFF. PKKFF is expected to be a 100 x stock by end of year. Sheldon has a long track record of picking major stocks before anyone else finds them. NAV of this stock should be at least 2 x value. Sheldon is so confident he is listing NAV on a monthly basis. Sheldon is a independent director Strategic Advisor of PKKFF. These 2 stocks are some of the most undervalued company's on OTC. Sheldon is the real deal. I call him the Warren Buffet of Canada. His insight helped me find PKKFF-PYR-HPQFF-MVMDF -DTMXF. Just type in his name watch the videos of these company's.3-5 year hold on all stocks.More,Hunter,,0,0

last month,Got back into IDKFF since I could not buy IP today due to halt why not they own a ton Of IP amd IP is about to go up,Cobra PILOT,,4,0
last month,Don’t forget....30% is controlled by insiders which allows them to hold the price down to buy more before the bigger moves. These are great prices to get in at.,Snoop,,1,0
last month,Hello Investors. Why is this board so quiet. I strongly feel this is a great long term investment as Sheldon has demonstrsted an inate ability to pick investments that will return 10x initial investments.  Why this is not trading above NAV is beyond me. This stock is way undervalued and under appreciated.,Barry,,0,0

2 months ago,Everyone, please do not believe that IDK is shorting CBDT. I have holdings in both companies and have reasons to believe this is a coordinated attack against both companies by the same shorters.Reasons:1- IDK are interested in psychedelics and it would make more sense to partner with CBDT than it would to destroy them. They could and would buy warrants. Not short. 2- CBDT and MTRX are MAJOR partners and IDK are on the board of MTRX Rob and Steve are friends. Sheldon would NOT betray RobMore,Allan,,0,0

2 months ago,Hello fellow investors. I have done some DD on this company and cannot believe the price of the stock now at $1.22  I would not be surprised if Sheldon is buying his own stock back at these levels. The NAV was at .90 more than 1 month ago. When Sheldon was at Pinecrest the company traded at 2X NAV which factored in domeof the value add of getting in before the tip of the iceberg. He has planted many seeds since last NAV. And the companies he as invested in are starting to realize their business plans. This stock I belive could easily be a mutibagger before the end of the year. Buy as much as you can at these levels. You won't see it again.More,Barry,,4,0
