4 months ago,For those considering this company, the more I learn about them the more bullish I am on this stock taking off, and bar chart showing this as a buy supported by recent uptick in share price.

I like the kinds of things they are investing in, and recently bought shares to go long with it.  Very bullish on this and expectations are high.More,Nobs,,0,0
