4 days ago,Finally seeing some respect for some of the brilliant investments Sheldon has made. This stock is still so undervalued. it should be trading at a premium to NAV recognizing the intercultural property premium. The next few months NAV reports should be showing great growth as more of Sheldon's investments start to mature. This will be  $5.00 stock in the next year or two. Just buy and HODL.,Barry,,4,0

last month,ThreeD Capital Inc. (‚ÄúThreeD‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) (CSE:IDK) (OTCQX:IDKFF), a Canadian-based venture capital firm focused on opportunistic investments in companies in the junior resources and disruptive technologies sectors, is pleased to announce a $400,000 investment in DeFi Yield Technologies Inc. (‚ÄúDeFi Yield Technologies‚Äù), a company that has a proprietary automated yield engine that has made investing in decentralized finance (‚ÄúDeFi‚Äù) simple and leverages different DeFi protocols and strategies to increase diversification, maximize yield, while minimizing exposure to risk.The Company has acquired 563,380 shares in DeFi Yield Technologies at a price of $0.71 per share. Sheldon Inwentash, Chairman and CEO of ThreeD, has also agreed to become an advisor to DeFi Yield Technologies.‚ÄúWe are excited to have ThreeD Capital as an investor and Sheldon Inwentash joining as an advisor. ThreeD and Sheldon Inwentash have a long track of investing in early stage companies and will help us scale the technology aiming to bring over 1 billion USD onto the platform in the near future.‚Äù said Philipp Kallerhoff, CEO of DeFi Yield Technologies.‚ÄúInvesting in decentralized finance can be complicated and it is easy to lose money if you do not know what you are doing. This makes it extremely difficult for DeFi to make it into the mainstream. DeFi Yield Technologies is reinventing financial services by building financial applications that allow anyone to invest and earn a return without having to understand all the different protocols and strategies.‚Äù said Sheldon Inwentash.More,appie,,3,0

5 months ago,ThreeD Capital NAV Climbs To $1.27 and stock price drops 25% from Early March $1 price to now .76. The fact that IDKFF has a major stake in PKKFF which will list on Nasdaq in early April baffles me. NAV will explode in the few quarters just from this one investment in PKKFF. PKKFF is expected to be a 100 x stock by end of year. Sheldon has a long track record of picking major stocks before anyone else finds them. NAV of this stock should be at least 2 x value. Sheldon is so confident he is listing NAV on a monthly basis. Sheldon is a independent director Strategic Advisor of PKKFF. These 2 stocks are some of the most undervalued company's on OTC. Sheldon is the real deal. I call him the Warren Buffet of Canada. His insight helped me find PKKFF-PYR-HPQFF-MVMDF -DTMXF. Just type in his name watch the videos of these company's.3-5 year hold on all stocks.More,Hunter,,0,0

They could and would buy warrants. Not short. 2- CBDT and MTRX are MAJOR partners and IDK are on the board of MTRX Rob and Steve are friends. Sheldon would NOT betray RobMore,Allan,,0,0

6 months ago,Hello fellow investors. I have done some DD on this company and cannot believe the price of the stock now at $1.22  I would not be surprised if Sheldon is buying his own stock back at these levels. The NAV was at .90 more than 1 month ago. When Sheldon was at Pinecrest the company traded at 2X NAV which factored in domeof the value add of getting in before the tip of the iceberg. He has planted many seeds since last NAV. And the companies he as invested in are starting to realize their business plans. This stock I belive could easily be a mutibagger before the end of the year. Buy as much as you can at these levels. You won't see it again.More,Barry,,4,0

10 months ago,For those considering this company, the more I learn about them the more bullish I am on this stock taking off, and bar chart showing this as a buy supported by recent uptick in share price.  Due your own DD, but why IDK?  It provides investors with significant exposure to ground floor opportunities in;	‚Ä¢	Small cap stocks in their very early stages;	‚Ä¢	Disruptive Technologies	‚Ä¢	Junior Resources‚Ä¶emphasis on precious metalsthat would otherwise be impossible for 99% of investors to participate in.&nbsp; Ares of their investments includes;	‚Ä¢	Esports	‚Ä¢	Renewable Technology	‚Ä¢	Blockchain	‚Ä¢	Artificial Intelligence	‚Ä¢	Internet of Things	‚Ä¢	Junior Resources 	‚Ä¢	NanotechnologyIt is in early stage investments in companies I can‚Äôt find myself nor have the time to research endlessly to locate, proven investors in the company look after the risk, and the value of that portfolio is expected to result in major share price growth of IDK.   I like the kinds of things they are investing in, and recently bought shares to go long with it.  Very bullish on this and expectations are high.More,Nobs,,0,0
