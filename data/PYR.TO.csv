8 days ago,Looking for your your opinions on this one as I am a bit puzzled. I am a fairly new shareholder of this company, started buying shares at the end of November 2020.I looked at the financial statements, watched some interviews of President Pascali on agoracom and others.. I came to the conclusion that this company has massive potential, company could be worth billions over the next years, so ended up buying 30,000 shares, average of $3.60 a share. Where I am puzzled:- In the last 10 fiscal years, the company averaged $5-7M in annual revenues - However, in their last quarter Q3 2020, they generated $8M in revenues, more than any full FY in the past 10-12- Plus they now have a backlog of $40M- So they seemed to be on the right track- But the bummer is that they announced that Q4 2020 revenues will be $3-5M.. hein?- They have a plant/lab of 38,000 square foot in Montreal. How many plasma torches they can produce in a year in this facility?- If they were to receive a purchase order of 500 plasma torches, what would it take to fulfill it?- Peter Pascali seems to be a really good guy, and knowledgeable. I always believe that CEOs must have 2 qualities: 1) they need to sell. Then (2) they need to be able to have a second one in either engineering, capital allocation, IT, etc.. Mr. Pascali certainly has the engineering part, but can he sell?- Then there is HPQ. Pyrogenesis has the potential to bring their ownership to 50% by converting their royalty into shares. Currently Pyrogenesis owns roughly 10% of HPQ (roughly 20% if we include the warrants). On the value of HPQ today, that 50% ownership would be worth $135M.Any insight you can provide would be appreciated, as I am a bit puzzled..More,Simon,,1,0

10 days ago,Just out this morning. Company thinks stock is undervalued and will be buying it's own shares. This is wonderful news. This lowers the float . I am shocked that the stock did not explode today. PyroGenesis Announces the Implementation of a NCIB today at 8:30am.The Company's Board of Directors believes that the market price of the Company's common shares may from time to time not reflect the underlying value of the Company, specifically its growth opportunities, and that the proposed purchasing of its common shares is in the best interests of the Company and represents an appropriate use of corporate funds. It is expected that any purchases made by the Company could also enhance value and liquidity for its shareholders. Pursuant to the NCIB, PyroGenesis may purchase, from time to time, over a period of 12 months starting January 14th, 2021 and ending January 13th, 2022, up to 5,000,000 common shares (approx. 3.14% of its common shares issued and outstanding as of January 4th, 2021). Shorts are going to be slaughtered when this gets on Nasdaq.More,Hunter,,13,0

(http://www.pyrogenesis.com) (TSX: PYR) (OTCQB: PYRNF) (FRA: 8PY), a high-tech company, (the "Company", the ‚ÄúCorporation‚Äù or "PyroGenesis") that designs, develops, manufactures and commercializes plasma atomized metal powder, plasma waste-to-energy systems and plasma torch products, is pleased to provide guidance for the fourth quarter, and full year, both ending December 31st, 2020.Based on preliminary financial information, and subject to year-end closing adjustments, PyroGenesis expects revenue for the fourth quarter 2020 to be between $3 - $5 million, resulting in total revenues for the fiscal year ending 2020 of approximately $14 - $16 million, as compared to $1.07 million (Q4 2019) and $4.8 million (FY 2019), respectively.The Company also expects earnings per share (‚ÄúEPS‚Äù) for the fourth quarter to be in the range of $0.10 - $0.12, and for the fiscal year ending 2020 of between $0.22 - $0.24 , as compared to a loss of $0.04 (Q4 2019) and a loss of $0.07 (FY 2020), respectively.The Q4 2020 guidance and actual 2019 results noted above are summarized in the following table below: 	Actual 2019	Guidance 2020Revenue	 	 Q4	$1.07 MM	$ 14-16 MMYE	$4.8 MM	$ 22-24 MMEPS Basic	 	 Q4	($0.04)	$0.10-$0.12YE	($0.07)	$0.22-$0.24About PyroGenesis Canada Inc.More,Dreamer1314,,8,1
11 days ago,Very long with PYRNF. When it lists on Nasdaq it will explode. New video from Cathie Wood of ark investments posted Jan 8 titled Senate Impact, Upcoming Earnings, Innovation | ITK with Cathie Wood . Go to the 28 minute mark as she talks about TSLA and bitcoin being the 2 of the greatest upside business she has seen in a long time. ARBKF and BFARF are 2 bitcoin stocks that look like a great way to play bitcoin. According to Cathie the greatest hedge against inflation is bitcoin. These low cap stocks just listed on otc and are at a bargain today . They are both expected to go above 10 by end of this year and both are very inexpensive and look like a no brainer to me just like PYRNF is. If they go to the Nasdaq an easy 20 plus stock. Hang in there everyone all we need is a major news release from PYRNF and this is an easy 25 plus stock this year alone. After a few quarters of earnings increases could get to 100 since this is such a low cap stock with massive potential.More,Hunter,,1,1
15 days ago,SNN Network Canada virtual event this morningIf I understood correctly, Peter validated that he's expecting a net value of 3M$ per torch.Clients A, B and C have a potential of around 1000 torches, which means a net value of 3B$.

He is helping to ensure the success of all his people and not just himself. Having the options vest over time, allows them to follow the price rises of the stock he is expecting, doesn't drop a ton of shares on the market at once, and ensures employees are motivated and excited about building a great company. When you take into account the fact they bought open market shares since april, which are then cancelled, there's no dilution really with these options. He simply took public shares out, to allow room for employee shares in their place, while also receiving money to the company to fuel operations.

8 months ago,Mac D thought cement producers were a good possibility for plasma arc.  Here's something about cement making that seems to be  needing like PYRO's tech to answer the heating problem:Kiln fuelsUsed tires being fed mid-kiln to a pair of long kilnsFuels that have been used for primary firing include coal, petroleum coke, heavy fuel oil, natural gas, landfill off-gas and oil refinery flare gas.[13] Because the clinker is brought to its peak temperature mainly by radiant heat transfer, and a bright (i.e. high emissivity) and hot flame is essential for this, high carbon fuels such as coal which produces a luminous flame are preferred for kiln firing. In favorable circumstances, high-rank bituminous coal can produce a flame at 2050 ¬∞C. Natural gas can only produce a flame of, at best 1950 ¬∞C, and this is also less luminous, so it tends to result in lower kiln output.Alternative fuelsIn addition to these primary fuels, various combustible waste materials have been fed to kilns. These alternative fuels (AF) include:    Used motor-vehicle tires    Sewage sludge    Agricultural waste    Landfill gas    Refuse-derived fuel (RDF)    Chemical and other hazardous wasteCement kilns are an attractive way of disposing of hazardous materials, because of:    the temperatures in the kiln, which are much higher than in other combustion systems (e.g. incinerators),    the alkaline conditions in the kiln, afforded by the high-calcium rawmix, which can absorb acidic combustion products,    the ability of the clinker to absorb heavy metals into its structure.A notable example is the use of scrapped motor-vehicle tires, which are very difficult to dispose of by other means. Whole tires are commonly introduced in the kiln by rolling them into the upper end of a preheater kiln, or by dropping them through a slot midway along a long wet kiln. In either case, the high gas temperatures (1000‚Äì1200 ¬∞C) cause almost instantaneous, complete and smokeless combustion of the tire. Alternatively, tires are chopped into 5‚Äì10 mm chips, in which form they can be injected into a precalciner combustion chamber. The steel and zinc in the tires become chemically incorporated into the clinker, partially replacing iron that must otherwise be fed as raw material.A high level of monitoring of both the fuel and its combustion products is necessary to maintain safe operation.[14]For maximum kiln efficiency, high quality conventional fuels are the best choice. However, burning any fuels, especially hazardous waste materials, can result in toxic emissions.[15] Thus, it is necessary for operators of cement kilns to closely monitor many process variables to ensure emissions are continuously minimized. In the U.S., cement kilns are regulated as a major source of air pollution by the EPA and must meet stringent air pollution control requirementsMore,lawrence,,2,1
8 months ago,So I was talking to a guy at work today about this great company I just bought into on Friday...and how we had a 25% pop today. I mentioned the name and started rifling off the same spiel I did below and he says "I watched a documentary about that on the weekend...they use torches to burn garbage on navy ships."...well I ask what was it? and he says "A plastic ocean, it's on Netflix"...I came home and decided to check it out, and for those that don't care to watch the whole hour and 40 minutes, it's at the 1hour and 10 minute mark...there is a brief, less than 2 minute clip of a air craft carrier and some footage of at least a replica of what is being provided from PryoGenesis...Name is mentioned and company name on the screen. I keep getting these little signs in the past week, all pointing to this company...just bizarre. I also noticed, the documentary is dated 2016...and again, story has been out there for years, and I'm just hearing about it.

8 months ago,Cemet!!!!!!!There's that word "sintering" which we saw in the iron pellet process and it's used with temps up to 1450 degrees.  Sure sounds like a perfect use for the plasma arc tech PLUS i remember reading years ago that used tires were used in the incineration process as a cheap source of heat - not good.Cement manufacturing is a complex process that begins with mining and then grinding raw materials that include limestone and clay, to a fine powder, called raw meal, which is then heated to a sintering temperature as high as 1450 ¬∞C in a cement kiln. In this process, the chemical bonds of the raw materials are broken down and then they are recombined into new compounds. The result is called clinker, which are rounded nodules between 1mm and 25mm across. The clinker is ground to a fine powder in a cement mill and mixed with gypsum to create cement. The powdered cement is then mixed with water and aggregates to form concrete that is used in construction.More,lawrence,,3,1

8 months ago,Here's a good read on possibly going for an uplisting to NASDAQ:The NASDAQ is the second-largest stock exchange by market cap in the world. As an American exchange, it has listed over 3,100 companies with average daily share trading volume at over two billion. NASDAQ has handled more IPOs than any other exchange. Since 2000, NASDAQ boasts over 1,000 Initial Public Offerings. What follows is a brief description of what NASDAQ is and what it takes to be listed on that exchange.What does NASDAQ stand for? It‚Äôs an acronym for National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations.What are the rules to be listed on NASDAQ? To be listed on the NASDAQ exchange and reporting system, the following requirements:    Shareholders Equity of at least $2,000,000    At least 100,000 shares of public float    A minimum of 300+ shareholders    Total assets of $4,000,000    At least two market makers    $3 minimum bid price of the company stock    Public float market value of $1,000,000 I‚Äôve heard a number of pushers for reverse mergers tout the ability of a company now listed on the Over the Counter (OTC) exchanges can ‚Äúgraduate‚Äù to NASDAQ or the NYSE. This is certainly possible and many salespeople will reference some big names like Turner Broadcasting, Occidental Petroleum or Berkshire Hathaway. Each of these companies are the wide exception to the rule. Unfortunately, transitioning to larger exchanges is much more difficult than many micro-cap business owners and management assume. However, it‚Äôs not out of reach as the numbers above showcase. Your best bet for being able to step up to the next exchange: build a good business that is investable. That is, focus on the business and not the financial engineering behind the business. If you have a great business, the money will flow in, the stock price will increase and the transition will be more than natural. The most common problem are the puffer fishes. They‚Äôre those that tout how great their business is, but who may have unrealistic expectations on their abilities and the growth within the market.More,lawrence,,0,3

last year,Not sure I ever saw this until today so here it is:Metal recovery system targets smaller facilities29 June 2018PyroGenesis' Drosrite System.PyroGenesis' Drosrite System.Powder producer PyroGenesis Canada has developed a smaller version of its Drosrite system for metal recovery, designed for small facilities.According to the company, Drosrite is a salt-free, sustainable process for maximizing metal recovery from dross, a waste generated in the metallurgical industry. PyroGenesis' patented process can avoid costly loss of metal while reducing a smelter's carbon footprint and energy consumption. The company says that the system can increase metal recovery from waste, without producing any hazardous by-products, while at the same time reducing operating costs.The Mini-Drosrite System can economically process 500 tons of dross/year when compared to the 3,000-7,500 tons/yr processed by PyroGenesis‚Äô larger system.‚ÄòThis smaller system enables us to target thousands of smaller facilities which were not originally in our target market,‚Äô said CEO Peter Pascali. ‚ÄòWe have targeted three main dross streams; aluminum, copper, and zinc, each divided between primary, secondary and casting producers. Presently we are focusing on the three segments within aluminum dross.More,lawrence,,4,0

The agreement now includes evaluating manufacturing porous Silicon wafers for solid-state Li-Ion batteries using Apollon patented process and Silicon (Si) produced by HPQ PUREVAP(TM) Quartz Reduction Reactor ("QRR") ("PVAP Si").APOLLON PATENTED LOW-COST APPROACH TO MAKING POROUS SILICON WAFERSIn 2012, Apollon, working in collaboration with France CNRS ("Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique"), developed and obtained a worldwide patent for a unique low-cost process that uses standard metallurgical Silicon (2N to 4N+ Si) to produce square porous Silicon Wafers with a thickness of up to 2 cm."The HPQ PUREVAP(TM) QRR's proprietary capacity of controlling the purity of the Silicon (Si) produced should allow our unique and patented process to optimize the porous structure of the wafers between Microporous (pore size &lt;5nm), Mesoporous (pore size 5nm - 50nm) and Macroporous (pore size &gt;50nm) as per end-users requirements, simply by adapting process parameters" stated Mr. Jed Kraiem Ph.D, General Manager of Apollon Solar.Working with Apollon, HPQ intends to develop the manufacturing of porous silicon wafers using PUREVAP(TM) Si that can be used as anodes for solid-state Li-ion batteries."Combining Apollon's patented low cost approach to make porous Si wafers and the HPQ PUREVAP(TM) Gen3 Pilot Plant's ability to produce Si will allow us to start the commercialisation of our porous Si wafers for solid state Li-Ion batteries earlier then most competitors, who are still only earlier stages R&amp;D plays" said Bernard Tourillon, President &amp; CEO of HPQ Silicon Resources Inc. Mr. Tourillon added: "Production of the first porous Silicon test wafers could start as early as Q4 2019."GLOBAL ENERGY STORAGE MARKET READY TO EXPLODEA recent report projects that energy storage deployments are estimated to grow 1,300% from a 12 Gigawatt-hour market in 2018 to a 158 Gigawatt-hour market in 2024. An estimated US$71 billion in investments will be made into storage systems where batteries will make up the lion's share of capital deployment. Research suggests that replacing graphite materials with Silicon anodes in Li-Ion Batteries promises an almost tenfold (10x) increase in the charging capacity of batteries."Silicon potential to meet energy storage demand is generating massive investments. HPQ, working with Apollon, fully intends to use its first mover advantage in low cost porous Silicon (Si) wafer manufacturing using metallurgically produced PUREVAP(TM) Silicon (2N to 4N+ Si) to attract investors and commercial interest" said Mr. Tourillon.About SiliconSilicon (Si) is one of today's strategic materials needed to fulfil the renewable energy revolution presently under way. Silicon does not exist in its pure state; it must be extracted from quartz, one of the most abundant minerals of the earth's crust and other expensive raw materials in a carbothermic process.About HPQ SiliconHPQ Silicon Resources Inc. is a TSX-V listed company developing, in collaboration with industry leader PyroGenesis (TSX-V: PYR) the innovative PUREVAP "Quartz Reduction Reactors" (QRR), a truly 2.0 Carbothermic process (patent pending), which will permit the transformation and purification of quartz (SiO2) into Metallurgical Grade Silicon (Mg-Si) at prices that will propagate its significant renewable energy potential.HPQ is also working with industry leader Apollon Solar to develop:-- Porous silicon wafers manufacturing using PUREVAP(TM) Silicon (PVAP Si) that can be used as anode for solid-state Li-ion batteries; and-- A metallurgical pathway of producing Solar Grade Silicon Metal (SoG Si) that will take full advantage of the PUREVAP QRR one-step production of high purity silicon (Si) and significantly reduce the Capex and Opex associated with the transformation of quartz (SiO2) into SoG-Si.HPQ focus is becoming the lowest cost producer of Silicon (Si), High Purity Silicon (Si), Porous Silicon Wafers and Solar Grade Silicon Metal (SoG-Si). The pilot plant equipment that will validate the commercial potential of the process is on schedule to start in 2019.This News Release is available on the company's CEO Verified Discussion Forum, a moderated social media platform that enables civilized discussion and Q&amp;A between Management and Shareholders.More,lawrence,,2,0

For additive manufacturing in particular, its range of powder encompasses Ti64 titanium, Tungsten Carbide, Tantalum, and Molybdenum, a common addition to steel and stainless steel alloys. In addition to spherical powders, the company also makes nanopowders.Since the expansion of its facilities in Quebec, Tekna is on track to increase the production of both its powdered products to over 1000 tonnes per year.Aperam, on the other hand, produces steel and stainless steel in bars, strips, wire rods and plates. In addition to its Luxembourg headquarters, the company has sites across 18 European nations, Russia, Asia, the Middle East and North and South America. This includes 2.5 million tonnes of flat stainless steel capacity in Europe and Brazil.A depiction of Tekna's ICP process. Image via Tekna.A depiction of Tekna‚Äôs ICP process.

3 years ago,ZINCAfter doing a little searching on GOOGLE I can see why there's interest in DROSRITE for zinc recovery.  From what I've read there's a massive looming shortage of zinc in the next few years so recovering every ounce possible from zinc dross is essential to profitability.  Just GOOGLE "zinc shortage" to read more and here's something re U.S. zinc usage especially page 6 where there's stats on zinc wastage.  If DROSRITE catches on for zinc recovery and I don't see any reason why it wouldn't what with shortages and rising prices this could be as big as AL recovery.As always....https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/zinc/mis-201802-zinc.pdfMore,lawrence,,2,0

3 years ago,Further to my response to MacD, looking at PYR's WEB site, I don't see a separate section devoted to DROSRITE and this is the tech that Pete says will lead the company to profitability in 2018.  I did drift thru all the headlines that were available and there wasn't any specifically for DROSRITE but I did copy this from PYR's recent PR on 2017 results and it seems inline with today's PR:DROSRITE‚Ñ¢:As the Company positioned itself, during 2017, to become a significant powder producer to the Additive Manufacturing Industry, it also successfully positioned its DROSRITETM Furnace System to become a fully commercial product line in and of its own right.2017 saw the commercial acceptance of PyroGenesis‚Äô patented DROSRITE‚Ñ¢ System with, not only an acceptance of its first commercial sale, but a subsequent re-order by the same client at a higher price.During this time, a successful demonstration of the DROSRITE‚Ñ¢ System in the Middle East has resulted in significant interest from that region while the Company‚Äôs demonstration  unit  is already fully booked in India, to September, with paid-for-demonstrations. This flurry of activity and interest for the DROSRITE‚Ñ¢ System resulted in the Company hiring a full-time  business development manager to market the DROSRITE‚Ñ¢ System, and who‚Äôs role is exclusively to secure DROSRITE‚Ñ¢ system sales. PyroGenesis is aggressively targeting both primary aluminum smelters in Asia and the Middle East where the market is estimated to be in excess of 1 million tonnes  of  dross1,  as  well  as  tertiary  casting  producers  worldwide.  These  two  markets  alone represent a potential market for DROSRITE‚Ñ¢ systems numbering in the hundreds of units.As of this writing, PyroGenesis1.is  currently  discussing  the  purchase  of  an  additional  two  (2)  systems  with  an  existing client;2.has  demonstrated  the  system  in  the  Middle  East  and  are  expected  to  close  on  the equivalent of three (3) systems over the next few months;3.has  a  demonstration  system  in  India  on  contract  for  paid-for-demonstrations,  which  if successful could result in 1-4 additional orders; Plus,4.as noted, this demonstration system is fully booked until September 2018.Due to this high demand for on-site paid-for demonstrations, the Company is in the process of constructing a second DROSRITE‚Ñ¢ demonstration system  which  is  expected  to  be  available  for demonstrations  in  Q3  2018.    There  is  a  high  probability  that  PyroGenesis  will  be  profitable  in 2018 from DROSRITE‚Ñ¢ system sales when combined with existing backlogIMore,lawrence,,0,0

3 years ago,Bill, Snowman, etc:My background and latest thoughts on PYR, FWIW - I really go back decades with additive manufacturing when 3-D Systems was a start-up on the the old Vancouver Exchange (never owned a share just watched it climb) and then I did catch ARCAM but sold after I doubled my money and then it went to $100 and split and doubled off the split price.  Then there was the 3-D printing craze 5 or 6 years ago with Stratasys and the rest of the start-ups that was like the DOT.COM craze.  Great if you caught any of them early but I never got into it.  Then some how I became aware of PYR (maybe it was Stockhouse @ The Bell) and I jumped all over it in the teens because of 2 things,  additive manufacturing to supply the metal powders and using plasma arc technology to produce the powders - both of these techs I dig and PYR was using both of them.So I've been holding PYR for maybe 2 years and thankfully I'm ahead of the game but here's my words of caution to current holders or anybody considering taking a position - CAUTION!!!  For a number of reasons:- re the metal powders business, PYR is kind of late into the business.  The additive manufacturing (AM) business has many firms producing parts from these powders ALREADY so there have to be any number of powder producers already in the supply chain.  My point is, PYR will have to produce powders in volume with prices that beat the competition for them to get a viable stance in the business.  AM businesses will go very slowly with PYR until there's a high level of confidence in their supply capability.  Nobody is going to trust PYR as a solitary supplier for powders until they can prove their trustworthiness insofar as quantities, quality, backup (QQB), etc.I'll sum this point up by saying that PYR has been at least a year into this spin-off business but until they prove the QQB the spin-off is nothing but smoke which has to be blown away so that the fire of hard orders from real players in the AM game are announced.- DROSRITE.  Having said all of the above, I'm very understanding and patient re the AM powders effort but I'm getting concerned about the silence on the 2nd test DROSRITE unit.  IMO, this not the Manhattan Project so why is it taking so long to get a 2nd unit built and out the door to supposedly eager potential clients who are willing to RENT the machine.  As near as I can tell PYR should have had adequate funds to finance construction for the past several months so why have we not heard that unit 2 is built OR at least a status on its construction.Enough for now.  I already have a gut full of PYR stock so I'm set but all of the above, to me, dictates CAUTION for current holders and especially newbies thinking about some entry point into PYR.As always, time will tell.More,lawrence,,1,0
3 years ago,I chanced to read an article by LPW Technology - a REAL player in the metal powder business for additive manufacturing which then led me to take a good look at their web site.

It's been a year since PYR's CEO first ventured the idea of spinning off the additive business and after seeing where LPW is at with their technology, IP, experience, customer relations, etc I can understand why there's been a dearth of news re PYR's progress.  PYR will never be another LPW, IMO, rather I could see PYR licensing their powder technology, if it's so great, to companies like LPW otherwise, if they continue to pursue the spin-off idea, I wouldn't hold my breath.This is worth the long look - enjoy:https://www.lpwtechnology.com/More,lawrence,,0,0

4 years ago,After reading this, it's time to really load up:GE Keeps Its Checkbook Handy After All-in Bet on 3-D Printingby Rick Cloughand Oliver SachgauApril 20, 2017, 4:00 AM CDT    Vice chairman sees ‚Äòone of the most disruptive innovations‚Äô    Pratt, Siemens also race to integrate devices in manufacturingGeneral Electric Co. shook up the 3-D printer market last year by laying down more than $1 billion on two acquisitions. Turns out that may be just the beginning.The manufacturing giant is weighing additional purchases to expand the fast-growing business, said David Joyce, GE‚Äôs vice chair in charge of 3-D printing. The burgeoning technology is becoming a new product line as well as a central component of GE‚Äôs effort to modernize its manufacturing operations, boost productivity and reshape how everything from locomotives to medical scanners to jet engines are made.In that process, GE is racing to beat out competitors such as Siemens AG and United Technologies Corp., which also are integrating advanced printers into their operations. The moves come as manufacturing is thrust into the spotlight amid the rise of President Donald Trump, who has pledged to revitalize the sector and reverse decades of job losses. While 3-D technology could help bring back factories, it‚Äôs unlikely to do the same for factory workers.The ability to print complex parts is ‚Äúone of the most disruptive innovations I‚Äôve seen in the manufacturing space in my 37 years here,‚Äù Joyce said in an interview in his Cincinnati-area office. As chief executive officer of GE Aviation, he‚Äôs helping lead adoption of 3-D technology within the company by incorporating printed parts into jet engines. ‚ÄúManufacturing is going through a renaissance,‚Äù he said.Industrial 3-D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, uses lasers and other technology to fuse ultra-thin layers of material such as metal powder or polymers, building parts from the bottom up. In a few hours, a machine can construct complex components that otherwise would be difficult or impossible to make. While the process has been used to build quick prototypes, integration into full-scale manufacturing has been limited by material and cost issues.New ApplicationsQuickTake: The Evolution of 3-D PrintingGE will expand its 3-D printing business through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth, Joyce said without naming potential targets. Several additive manufacturers have gained recently on increased investor interest in the technology. Stratasys Ltd. surged 45 percent this year through Wednesday, while 3D Systems Corp. advanced 15 percent.New applications are emerging and GE‚Äôs aggressive push into the market may lead to quicker adoption of the machines across the factory sector. The global market for industrial 3-D printers and materials increased 17 percent last year to $6.06 billion, according to data from Wohlers Associates Inc. The research firm projects the market to balloon to $26.2 billion by 2022.GE is even more optimistic. The technology could take a piece of the roughly $14 trillion market for traditional manufacturing, said Mohammad Ehteshami, GE‚Äôs vice president of additive integration.‚ÄúIf we do only half a percent, that‚Äôs still $70 billion,‚Äù he said.The Boston-based company is in prime position, having spent more than $1 billion late last year to take majority stakes in European printer makers Arcam AB and Concept Laser GmbH. Offer RejectedGE has aggressively sought out deals. Before striking the Concept Laser pact, the company made an offer for Germany‚Äôs SLM Solutions Group AG. GE walked away after failing to receive support from SLM investors including billionaire Paul Singer. GE also approached Germany‚Äôs EOS GmbH but was rebuffed.‚ÄúI said, why should we become part of a customer when there‚Äôs a market to develop?‚Äù recalled Hans Langer, the founder and CEO of closely held EOS.GE aims to sell 9,000 3-D printers to outside customers over the next decade in industries such as automotive, medical and aerospace. And by the middle of the next decade, the company expects to wring $3 billion to $5 billion from costs by using the machines in its own manufacturing operations, Joyce said.GE had its ‚ÄúAha!‚Äù moment in 2011.After failing eight times to build an intricate part for a new jet turbine, engineers sent the design to a 3-D printing company, Morris Technologies. A few days later, GE had the metal-alloy piece in hand, and Ehteshami rushed to GE‚Äôs head of manufacturing. ‚ÄúI said, ‚ÄòBuy ‚Äôem, trust me,‚Äô‚Äù Ehteshami recalled. GE acquired Morris in 2012, and the part -- a fuel nozzle -- is now used in new jet engines.Competitive AdvantageYour cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email.Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter.The stakes are high as major manufacturers try to reap competitive advantage from new technology. GE‚Äôs aviation division is working on a new turboprop engine for which about 35 percent will be 3-D printed. United Technologies‚Äô Pratt &amp; Whitney division uses printed brackets and other components for a jet engine that competes with one made by GE. At a February shareholder meeting, Siemens CEO Joe Kaeser showed off a 3-D-printed turbine blade that is being tested.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a revolution in how we design, produce, buy and digitally connect parts,‚Äù said Markus Seibold, the head of additive manufacturing for Siemens Power and Gas, which competes with GE‚Äôs power-turbine business.Printing could also upend the supply chain as equipment makers rely less on third parties for processes like casting and forging. And over time, machinery like 3-D printers and robots could further displace workers; since peaking in 1979, the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs has fallen 37 percent to about 12.4 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Alongside tech giants such as IBM and Amazon, GE has ‚Äúthe deep pockets and they‚Äôre taking a lead‚Äù in modernizing U.S. manufacturing, said Barclays Plc analyst Scott Davis.‚ÄúThey could screw it up, but they could get it right,‚Äù Davis said. ‚ÄúAnd if they get it right it could be amazingly valuable.‚ÄùMore,lawrence,,4,0
4 years ago,More good news:MONTR√âAL, QU√âBEC--(Marketwired - April 25, 2017) - HPQ Silicon Resources Inc ("HPQ") (TSX VENTURE:HPQ)(FRANKFURT:UGE)(OTC PINK:URAGF) would like to inform its shareholders of the following significant advances in its Purevap‚Ñ¢ project with strategic partner PyroGenesis Canada Inc ("PyroGenesis").Work is now transitioning from bench scale testing to Pilot Plant, as PyroGenesis approaches completion of phase 1 of the Process Characterization phase. Bench scale testing will continue and overlap with the start of equipment purchase and assembly of the Pilot Plant. The purpose of the Process Characterization bench scale work is threefold: Determine the best and most efficient way to scale up the PUREVAP‚Ñ¢ QRR processDetermine the best and most efficient way to scale up the PUREVAP‚Ñ¢ QRR processGenerate the necessary data required for the design of the 200 Tonnes Per Year High Purity to Solar Grade Silicon Metal pilot-scale system announced on August 2nd 2016;Complete tests at different operational settings to identify the best and most efficient way to produce High Purity to Solar Grade Silicon Metal.Payments totalling $1,072,000 were made in two tranches to Pyrogenesis in February and March to continue the work on the design and fabrication of the PureVap‚Ñ¢ pilot plant equipment.
