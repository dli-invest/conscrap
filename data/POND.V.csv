Algae is expected to be the future of plant-based feeds for livestock. Their resource efficient method requires minimal land and loses zero water. They've recently announced their entry to the XPRIZE Carbon Removal competition funded by Elon Musk (with a prize of $100M). (Link: https://www.pondtech.com/media-releases/press-release-former-carbon-xprize-semi-finalist-pond-technologies-announces-entry-to-elon-musk-sponsored-xprize-carbon-removal-competition/) POND currently has 9 US patents and 24 international patents in process globally. The annual global markets that algae can supply exceeds $400B. Using a greenhouse gas associated with global warming to create algae products is a game changer considering the current climate crisis, and I'll be sure to watch this one closely.More,May,,1,0

5 months ago,Canadian Federal Government working hard to reduce emissions… “What was tabled on Monday was the promise to introduce an investment tax credit for capital invested in CCUS projects in 2022, following a 90 day consultation period with stakeholders.” POND has ample opportunity in this carbon capture and carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) industry. The world has a drastically far way to go to meet its goals – “according to the International Energy Agency, the world has a long way to go. We are only at five per cent of the 800 million tonnes (MT) of carbon dioxide that must be annually captured and sequestered by 2030 if we are to meet those goals.” https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/road-ahead-carbon-capture-storage-federal-budget-yedlin-1.5994628 We Could Be A Leader in Canada's Quest to Reduce Emissions!!

8 months ago,I'm trying to understand how the money changes hands with this company. It's not very clear who makes what money and when. For example, if they install one of their bioreactors on an industry CO2 emitting factory, and the algae is growing for them to harvest. Why does the factory pay Pond? Pond is using the factory's C02 emissions,  would Pond not have to pay them? It's cool that they're keeping C02 from entering the atmosphere, but how are their products doing?,Doofus,,1,0
