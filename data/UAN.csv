yesterday,Can we talk post-war, cease-fire, sanctions lifted.... from what I understand, the global supply of fertilizers was greatly under pressure way before the situation in Europe.  Is it generally understood that while prices would come down if Russia/Belarus sanctions were lifted, the global supply would still be insufficient to satisfy all of the demand?  Also, Scotiabank mentioned that prices could down after the planting season but, from what I've been reading, customers are so worried about next year's supply that they're buying early (aka stocking up) which would keep the demand pressure on.,Cold Beef Cake,,0,0

AP News reports more than 3,000 CP Rail conductors, engineers, train, and yard workers represented by the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference stepped off the job Sunday as the union and CP Rail couldn't strike a deal.CP Rail is the leading carrier of potash, a potassium-rich salt mined from underground deposits formed from evaporated sea beds millions of years ago, used to support crop development. In prior investor documents, the rail company said it hauls 70% of the potash produced in North America, all from mines in Canada. The railroad also carries fertilizers, including phosphate, urea, ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, and anhydrous ammonia. A disruption of fertilizer shipments could significantly impact US farmers on the cusp of planting season. The work stoppage may exacerbate existing supply chain bottlenecks in North America stemming from COVID. The agricultural sector can't afford any more disruptions as Western economic sanctions on Russia and Belarus, two major fertilizer producers, have unleashed higher prices globally and shortage fears. Here's how much fertilizer Russia exports to North America. The union said they tried to continue bargaining, but CP Rail "chose to put the Canadian supply chain and tens of thousands of jobs at risk.""As Canadians grapple with a never-ending pandemic, exploding commodity prices and the war in Ukraine, the rail carrier is adding an unnecessary layer of insecurity, especially for those who depend on the rail network," the union said.Canadian potash spot prices per ton in USD are nearing record-high levels. CP Rail extends throughout the Midwest; Its rail services cover Dakotas, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, other regions, including parts of the Northeast. Federal negotiators are moderating the discussions between CP Rail and the union. However, there's no timeline on when an agreement will be reached. Mike Steenhoek, the Iowa-based executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition, was quoted by Reuters as saying, "the current war in Ukraine is placing additional pressure on delivering U.S. agricultural production and inputs, particularly fertilizer." "A shut down in operations at Canadian Pacific will certainly compound that stress," Steenhoek said. Canada is about a month away from seeding, and parts of the US could be imminently ready to plant. If farmers don't have enough fertilizer on hand, it could have severe implications for declining yields for this year's harvest. For the sake of the North American food supply, let's hope a resolution is found shortly. Otherwise, anyone who didn't prepare for food shortages will be eating lentils and insects. 9,93442NEVER MISS THE NEWS THAT MATTERS MOSTZEROHEDGE DIRECTLY TO YOUR INBOXReceive a daily recap featuring a curated list of must-read stories.SHOW COMMENTS3,000 Canadian Pacific Rail Workers Strike As Fertilizer Shipments Grind To Halt Tyler Durden's PhotoBY TYLER DURDENMONDAY, MAR 21, 2022 - 01:43 PMThe North American agricultural sector could be in for a major shock if Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd's (CP Rail) work stoppage is not resolved in a timely manner because it could spark a shortage of fertilizer and other shipments critical for the spring growing season, according to AP News.

(DTN graphic)MT. JULIET, Tenn. (DTN) -- In 2020, corn growers with high-productivity ground in central Illinois spent about $143 per acre on fertilizer, according to crop budgets from the University of Illinois. Forecasts for 2022 climbed to $230 per acre.But actual expenditures could be higher. When the Farmdoc team made their estimates in December, they argued that many farmers booked their needs before anhydrous prices topped $1,000 per ton. They also estimated farmers would likely reduce application rates to control costs and factored in the chance prices could come down by planting season.But with drought in South America and the war in Ukraine pushing the National Corn Index, a measure of spot cash prices at grain elevators, to more than $7 per bushel and December corn futures to more than $6.25 per bushels, farmers will be motivated to grow as many bushels as possible.Global supply issues have also continued to push the price of fertilizers higher. According to DTN's weekly survey of fertilizer retailers, the average retail price of anhydrous ammonia for the second week of March 2022 was $1,490 per ton. Two years ago, farmers paid an average of $490 per ton. You can read more here: https://www.dtnpf.com/….USDA collects survey data on how much money farmers spend on fertilizer each year, aggregated to the state level. USDA is currently surveying farmers on their 2021 expenses, so the most recent data available is for 2020. It found that U.S. farmers spent $24.4 billion on fertilizer, lime and soil conditioner, about $1.1 million more than the previous year.Given the state of current retail prices, it's fair to assume the amount farmers spend on fertilizer in 2022 will skyrocket. But, historically, the states that spend the most on fertilizer haven't changed very much. In fact, the five states that spend the most on fertilizer have been in the same order for the past five years.More,richard,,5,0

13 days ago,Canadia’s Nutrien Ltd. said Wednesday it would boost potash production by about one million metric tons in 2022 to a total of 15 million tons, with most of the additional volume coming in the second half of the year.That may not be nearly enough to meet demand. Sanctions on major producers means there could be a shortage. Second-ranked producer Russia may face sanctions due to its invasion of Ukraine, while third-ranked Belarus has already been cut off from global markets. That leaves Canada scrambling to supply agriculture powerhouses like Brazil, the biggest importer. The northern nation already supplies nearly all of the potash used in the U.S.“Nutrien’s move to add one million metric tons of capacity, while sorely needed by the market, does not come close to fixing the supply gap if both Russia and Belarus are sanctioned out of the global potash trade,” said Alexis Maxwell, an analyst for Bloomberg’s Green Markets.Russia and Belarus together supply about 42% of the $35 billion global potash trade, or some 24 million metric tons annually, Maxwell said.More,richard,,5,0

Russia accounts for 23% of ammonia production globally, as well as 14% of urea and 21% of potash production, suggesting that a fertilizer export ban would further exacerbate already sky high fertilizer prices.		However, the full statement from the Russian trade ministry said, "the ministry had to recommend Russian producers temporarily suspend export shipments of Russian fertilizers until carriers resume rhythmic work and provide guarantees that Russian fertilizer exports will be completed in full."		The market may not be willing to take the Ministry's word at face value; however, the comments come on the back of major shipping groups suspending operations to and from Russia.		Importantly, Russia had already banned ammonium nitrate exports in an announcement February 2nd, whereby trade was to be postponed until April 2022.		European energy prices have pushed commodity feedstock costs higher, lifting global prices across the commodity complex; US fertilizer producers like CVR Partners (NYSE:UAN), CF Industries (NYSE:CF) and Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) stand to benefit from comparatively cheap feedstock costs and high fertilizer prices.		Fertilizer markets remain extremely tight; however, there is a path forward for Russian exporters, when and if shippers are able to load Russian volumes, and if the Ministry's statement Friday proves factual.More,richard,,5,0

And then there is the whacky thing where the price gets pushed down two or three dollars at the end of the day only to rebound as much on the first after-hours trade. I can't help but believe someone continues trying desperately to keep the price from going up too fast...so they can eventually put in a low-ball offer on the company but pitch it as a "fair offer".  Stock should be 130-140 a share by now.,halv,,5,0
27 days ago,Been doing some more reading on UBIT of MLP's in IRA's.Thanks for your comments from my last post.So, here is what I think will generally happen with UBIT if UAN goes from 115 to 215 in a year and pays out $40 per share in distributions...(maybe a dream?)  I think the $100 per share capital gain would be mostly tax-freesince capital gains in IRA's are not taxable (except for depreciation recapture at sale whichshould not be significant if UAN sold in a year).Probably most of the $40 per share distribution from UAN (hypothetical) would be taxable. The depreciation recapture at the sale would result in ordinaryUBIT tax. This is why I am suggesting most of the $40 dividend would be UBI as some of the initial $40 distribution would be shielded from tax by depreciation, but would then be taxed as UBI at sale in a year as depreciation recapture.My point is, if an MLP increases significantly in price in a year, not all of the capital gains and distributions would be taxed at up to 37%. Just sharing this as some of this logic also applies to UAN tax dynamics held outsidean IRA. One advantage of having securities in an IRA is that both short-term and long-term "net" capital gains are not taxable (as noted by another person).More,Richard,,3,1

last month,Back in 2010 to 2012 UAN was about 2/3rds the production capacity of what it is today (ie, it was smaller).  Today fertilizer prices are higher than they were in that earlier time period.  At that time, in 2012, UAN hit $280, and was regularly above $200.  So, since UAN today has larger production capacity and the thing that UAN sells today commands a higher price than it did in 2012, why is the UAN unit price only about half of what it was back then?  Lets face it, with Russia at war the price of ammonia and UAN IS NOT going down to 2019 levels any time soon.  The price of corn continues to rise, and that means farmers can pay the currently high prices for fertilizer and still make loads of money.  That means demand is strong, sales price is strong, profitability is strong, and UAN has larger production capacity than it did 10 years ago, so the unit price should be ABOVE the price it was ten years ago.  It's just logic.  Whatever, eventually the big time distributions coming our way will pull the price higher.More,Geezer31,,9,0

last month,CF said multiple times in their conference call that the fertilizer demand and high prices are expected to last for at least a few years, and perhaps longer.  They and others will want to increase capacity going forward if their long term forecasts are reasonably accurate, and (here's the kicker) the cost to purchase existing fertilizer plants in the US is lower than the cost to build new green field fertilizer manufacturing facilites.  That says to me they think the price to buy UAN and gain ownership of the two UAN manufacturing plants is lower than the cost of building two new plants, so ...... this was said NUMEROUS times in the call (without mention of UAN specifically, but UAN's valuation is transparent in the market due to small size (two plants) and publicly traded units), so I think it's safe to assume the UAN is a future acquisition target for the big fertilizer companies.  I have no idea what a takeover premium might be, but hopefully nothing happens until post-Q2 2022 distribution announcement, because I expect H1 distribution news will push UAN's unit price much higher than it's current $100.More,Geezer31,,7,0

2 months ago,Fertilizer Prices Jump in North America on Race for SuppliesBy Elizabeth Elkin BloombergFebruary 4, 2022, 12:26 PM ESTNorth American fertilizer prices rose the most in almost five months this week as a global competition for supplies means farmers could still have a ways to go before seeing relief from high nutrient costs.The Green Markets North America Fertilizer Price Index jumped 11%, the most since the week ended Sept. 10. India, the world’s largest importer of the popular nitrogen fertilizer urea, is looking to buy product later than usual. That will increase competition for nitrogen in the first quarter of 2022, when the U.S. and Europe are looking to buy, said Alexis Maxwell, an analyst for Bloomberg’s Green Markets.“India’s seasonally late urea tender firmed a market looking for direction,” she said by email. “Prices rose globally with the U.S. market up $90 per short ton on the news.”Urea prices in New Orleans rose 10% this week, also the most since September.Crop nutrient prices have surged to records around the world following an energy crunch that curbed production in Europe, while supplies also face threats from export curbs and trade sanctions. Though prices in the U.S. have dipped off records, they remain high. That’s adding to costs for farmers and prompting some to curb fertilizer usage, threatening to curb crop yields and further raise global food prices that are near a record high.More,Do,,3,0

2 months ago,UAN good newsMOINES (DTN) -- Ethanol producers in Iowa are coming off one of the strongest quarters of production and profitability in history as demand in the latter part of 2021 was better than anticipated, even with higher corn prices.Typically, the winter months are slower, but ethanol prices have been higher to overcome strong corn prices. Ethanol producers were somewhat caught off-guard by the demand they saw for fuel toward the end of the year."As part of the ethanol industry right now, we're seeing a really attractive margin environment," said Mike Jerke, president and CEO of Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy near Council Bluffs, Iowa. "It's good, and in our business, if you can get through the winter months, the seasonality is such where you are just trying to hold things together, and quite frankly, we're doing much better than just holding things together right now."POSITIVE SIGNSMoving into the next quarter, signs remain positive."At the end of the day, we're a commodity business. The whole industry will respond to positive margins by producing more. That will also have the effect of bringing those margins back. It will be interesting to see as we move into spring and the driving season, the buildup and if we are able to maintain the momentum."Dave Sovereign, board president for Golden Grain LLC in Mason City, said margins currently remain good, but not quite what they were during the last four months of 2022."Historically, they are at record levels, or at least at the high side of the trends," Sovereign said.Sovereign and others said the ethanol industry also was able to benefit from some supply chain logistics. Slower train performance in some areas of the country led to higher demand needs for ethanol."That's adding to the demand right now," Sovereign said. He added the industry has rebounded dramatically from the pandemic in 2020. "Especially this fourth quarter. Nobody saw that coming. You couldn't have planned for that type of dynamic coming together. That quarter was the best in the history of Golden Grain," which began producing ethanol in 2004.More,richard,,5,0

2 months ago,UAN good newsDEERFIELD, Ill., January 27, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CF Industries Holdings, Inc. today welcomed the U.S. Department of Commerce’s ("Commerce") affirmative preliminary determinations in its antidumping duty ("AD") investigations of imports of urea ammonium nitrate ("UAN") from Russia and Trinidad and Tobago ("Trinidad"). This follows Commerce’s affirmative preliminary countervailing duty ("CVD") determinations for UAN from Russia and Trinidad, issued in November 2021."Commerce’s affirmative preliminary antidumping and countervailing duty determinations not only address unfair trade practices that have harmed the U.S. UAN industry and its workers, but also help ensure that this vital product remains readily available to U.S. farmers from reliable domestic suppliers," said Tony Will, president and chief executive officer, CF Industries Holdings, Inc. "We appreciate the thorough, fact-driven investigations conducted by Commerce professionals and their impartial application of U.S. law. We look forward to participating in the post-preliminary phase of these investigations."Commerce found that Russian UAN imports are dumped (i.e., sold at less than fair value) into the U.S. market at rates ranging from 9.15% to 127.19%, and that Trinidadian UAN imports are dumped at a rate of 63.08%. As a result of these determinations, Commerce will impose cash deposit requirements on imports of UAN from Russia and Trinidad, based on the preliminary rates of dumping. Additional CVD cash deposit requirements are already in place based on Commerce’s previous preliminary finding that Russian UAN imports are unfairly subsidized at rates ranging from 9.66% to 9.84%, and that Trinidadian UAN imports are unfairly subsidized at a rate of 1.83%.More,richard,,7,0
2 months ago,Breaking News yesterday - US Anti dumping investigation concludes both Russia and Trinidad companies guilty of dumping -    Trinidad and Tobago got 68% tax. They were 37% of US import and they are now out of the game.Russian companies which export 43% of total US import got 9-127%, each Russian company got a different tax (in addition to 9% tariff). I guess they can play it dirty  and have the company which got 9% tax to "buy" from all the other Russian companies which got higher taxes and export into the US and pay 9% (plus 9% tariff). So to summarize- T&amp;T are probably out of the game.Russia might play games but will have 18% total tax as minimum. obviously I don't think they can sell all via one company as it will be easy to spot. Definitely a support for high prices. They have 135 days to appeal.More,tony,,0,0

So to summarize- T&amp;T are probably out of the game.Russia might play games but will have 18% total tax as minimum. obviously I don't think they can sell all via one company as it will be easy to spot. Definitely a support for high prices. They have 135 days to appeal.More,tony,,2,0

CVR Partners, LP (NYSE:UAN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 5Like other industries, the agriculture sector has also been hit by supply shortages in the past few months. An increase in demand for corn has led to more corn being planted. This has led to an increase in demand for nitrogen fertilizers, a key product of CVR Partners, LP (NYSE:UAN). Corn crops that do not use nitrogen fertilizers have yields affected by as much as 40%. The prices of nitrogen fertilizer have thus more than doubled in the past few months, leading to greater revenues for firms like CVR Partners, LP (NYSE:UAN).The positive business momentum is also reflected in the share price of CVR Partners, LP (NYSE:UAN) that has climbed more than 390% in the past twelve months. With supply disruptions likely to persist in 2022, the stock has plenty of room to climb even higher.There has been increased hedge fund interest in CVR Partners, LP (NYSE:UAN) as well. At the end of the third quarter of 2021, 5 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $20 million in CVR Partners, LP (NYSE:UAN), up from 3 in the preceding quarter worth $18 million.Just like CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

(CRU graphic)Global nitrogen demand is expected to increase in 2022 despite higher prices. (CRU graphic)OMAHA (DTN) -- Despite significantly higher fertilizer prices across the globe throughout 2021, global nitrogen fertilizer demand appears to be set to increase in 2022. According to fertilizer analysts, demand destruction does not appear to be on the horizon.Nitrogen supplies continue to be tight with various supply issues, but the price of nutrients could begin to fall in the second half of the year as supply returns. The number of corn acres in the United States in 2022 could affect nitrogen supplies.GLOBAL N DEMAND TO INCREASE?According to the International Fertilizer Association (IFA) Public Summary Medium-Term Fertilizer Outlook 2021-2025 (https://www.fertilizer.org/…) released in August of 2021, global fertilizer use (N+P+K) was estimated at 198.2 million metric tons (mmt) in 2020-21, which was almost 10 mmt or 5.2% higher than in 2019-20. This was the largest increase since 2010-11.The rate of growth in all fertilizer demand is expected to slow to 0.9% in 2021-22. IFA forecasts global fertilizer use to reach 199.9 mmt.Nitrogen experienced a 4.1% increase in demand to 110 mmt in 2020-21. Annual growth in global fertilizer demand will be around 1% from 2021-22 to 2025-26.Global ammonia production increased by 2.9 mmt in 2020, taking total supply to 185 mmt. From 2015 to 2020, global ammonia capacity increased by 6 mmt.World urea demand is forecast to increase about 3% in 2022 to around 170 mmt, according to London-based consulting firm CRU. Chris Lawson, head of fertilizers for CRU, told DTN that demand destruction from higher nitrogen prices has been overstated.The various supply issues globally are well established in 2021, from increasing demand to the supply-chain issues.Lawson said nitrogen is a product that is fairly inelastic. While there are issues with supply causing prices to spike higher, farmers are still going to buy and apply the most important nutrient, he said."There are different ways of looking at demand destruction," Lawson said. "What might happen is North American farmers will get their nitrogen, but farmers in other parts of the world may be short some."More Recommended for YouKub's DenHigh Fertilizer Prices: The History and FuturePrices for dry urea fertilizer are 143% above year-ago levels, but only 13% above the previous all-time high from 2012.

Four questions can help producers decide how to adjust their fall fertilizer program, as they eye uncertain spring supplies. (DTN photo by Pamela Smith)10/26/2021 | 3:50 PM CDTHere are four questions that can help farmers adjust their fertilizer program, as prices soar...HIGH NATURAL GAS PRICESOne reason nitrogen prices climbed higher on the world market in 2021 is the situation with higher natural gas prices, specifically in Europe.Natural gas prices have risen globally as countries reopen their economies and lifted COVID-19 restrictions, and thus natural gas demand increased. Higher prices earlier this fall in Europe caused fertilizer manufacturers to curtail production with changing margins.CF Industries halted production at two United Kingdom nitrogen facilities in September because of the skyrocketing natural gas price. One plant reopened a week later, and the other plant reopened in October, thanks to a UK subsidiary deal.While some might believe fertilizer producers could be limiting production of nutrients to increase the price, Lawson said nitrogen fertilizer producers are producing as much product as they possibly can. Many manufacturers are even delaying maintenance to their facilities to continue to produce much-needed tons of nitrogen, he added.With production at full tilt, at some point, the supply will catch up with the demand and fertilizer prices will begin to level off. Lawson believes this could be seen by the second half of 2022.U.S. CORN ACRES MATTERWhat happens in North America, specifically the U.S., has a large effect on the global nitrogen fertilizer market.More,Ross,,0,0

So the pressure on that sector is a different than we’ve faced before.When is the last time that we saw the threat of famine or world hunger on a scale that we’re seeing today?This is worse than 2007-2008 for sure, in terms of what we call levels of acute food insecurity driven by conflict. But globally, the overall situation is still better than in those years — in the sense that we still have food availability but the problem today is of food access. But it is entering a situation that I call an orange light, and potentially a red light if we’re not careful. … We don’t have a food crisis today. We have a problem of recession and food access.

5 months ago,UAN excellent newsAnhydrous prices surged 38% from October to November, and now averages $1,113/ton. The nitrogen fertilizer is 163% more expensive than at this time last year. (DTN chart)MT. JULIET, Tenn. (DTN) -- The average retail price of anhydrous set a record this week at $1,113/ton after increasing 38% from last month. The seven other major fertilizers tracked by DTN for the first week of November saw increases ranging from 9% to 36% as supply disruptions push prices to new highs. DTN considers a monthly price change of 5% or more to be significant.DTN began collecting fertilizer price bids in 2008 as expanding corn acreage pushed up demand for fertilizer, taking prices with it. DTN reported anhydrous' highest price during the first week of November that year, at $1,043/ton. And while the nitrogen fertilizer is the most expensive of the eight DTN monitors today, it wasn't back then. That honor went to 10-34-0, which cost $1,250/ton. MAP was close behind at $1,079/ton. This year, high prices are more related to supply chain issues and worries about shortages than increased demand. The entire fertilizer complex is seeing higher prices, but the largest movers this month are nitrogen products.The average price of UAN28 is 36% higher than last month at $545/ton. UAN32 is 32% more expensive at $604/ton, while urea is up 26% at $820/ton. All are new records for DTN's database.Potash and DAP prices are 11% higher than last month, at $750/ton and $814/ton, respectively. MAP costs an average of $900/ton, up 9%.Unlike 2008, 10-34-0 is the laggard. While it's up 10% from last month at $702/ton, it's only 54% higher on the year, far less than the price gains seen in other fertilizers. Anhydrous is now 163% more expensive than in the first week of November 2021. UAN28 is 162% higher. UAN32 costs 144% more. Urea, 129%. Farmers are paying 127% more for potash, 88% more for MAP and 82% more for DAP.More,richard,,9,0

5 months ago,From cf industry conference call We believe global supply will remain constrained in the near term, with relief unlikely to appear anytime soon. We believe inventory in the channel is very low. Global production has been lower in 2021 due to severe weather in North America, higher maintenance worldwide, and ongoing European shutdowns and curtailments. Further, the Russian and Chinese governments are discouraging nitrogen fertilizer exports through the spring. These factors suggest the potential for strong fertilizer demand to last beyond 2023 even as some regions are unable to secure enough product in this supply constrained environment, resulting in lower yields. If this were to happen, demand would be deferred into future years as it would take more than two growing seasons to replenish global grain and oilseed stocks. As we prepare for the spring application season, we continue to receive substantial interest for any product we offer into the marketplace. We are building a solid order book for the first quarter of 2022 at the prices you see in the market today. The demand side of the equation is still very strong. And you're correct, what we sold for fall and we're applying today was sold at levels much lower than the current market, which is probably over $1,000 for ammonia. That being said, we're selling $1,000 ammonia for fall application on our incremental tons that are available, where, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're selling urea. And there is significant demand at that $730, $750 a short ton NOLA. It's even higher in the interior at over $800, which we've transacted at Port Neal. And you've seen in the publications the UAN reaction and the demand pulling. And I just looked at the analysis of where we are to date with order books and demand, and again, in a very good place at $550 UAN, calculating all that forward with current trend yield at 177 bushels per acre on the trend yield, that's not considering the I states, where you'll be 200 to 275 bushels.More,Ross,,6,0

Q4 fertilizer pricing will not be close to current prices as the price jump really occurred in October, and much of Q4 production was already sold before the price increase began.  Their realized prices will really rocket higher in H1 2022.  They expect to have some firm options on monetizing the carbon credits by Q1 2022.  The CEO thinks the strong cycle may last for a while, although no one really knows the future.  The key thing to watch is corn and wheat prices, if they are high fertilizer prices are likely to remain high.  In general the call wasn't a rocket ship launch, but it did confirm the positive environment, and the likelihood of steadily improving results next Q and much much better results through next summer as the higher fertilizer prices appear in the financial statements.More,Geezer31,,5,0

5 months ago,I suppose I have to enter the distribution sweepstakes Disclaim:   I remain long, slight increase in position (held back by diversification limits) and expect an increased distribution over at least the next two quarters.Estimate:  $3.00-3.40, 3.25 most likely...could be larger and I'd be pleasantly surprised if we get a windfall but I tend to hold my cards very closely.I run more cautious than most everyone else here and I'll outline my reasoning:(1) Like most boards, I still see a considerable amount of projection / confirmation bias influencing estimates. (No, not -all- of you, just -some- of you).  Accentuate the positive and all that....(2) Yes, -spot- prices are still extremely strong, but we don't know for how long.  Neither does management(3) I've been busy and haven't mined the 10-K's -but-:  contract tends to be lower and we don't know how much forward sale for next season will be under contract and not spot.(4) Too may people focusing on gross selling price, forgetting that UAN, like everyone else, is caught up in a cost increase cycle for inputs, logistics. We'll still be up, but maybe not quite as much once this gets factored in and we don't know how long cost growth will continue (i.e. longer than selling price increase?).  Think net, not gross, please?And, again, still bullish, still expecting an increased distribution - just a more sustainable/managed one.(5) Same applies for their customers - who are being eaten alive by fuel, equipment and logistics costs. The past is already written but future buying may be more constrained than expected.  Look at the backwardation in corn after a good season. There are some estimates that a significant fraction of farmers may need a corn price -higher-than current (high 5's? - I've seen 5.80 suggested for smaller farmers but, no, I don't recall the source on that) just to break even. Consider that they may switch to beans.  Management may want to withhold a cash buffer to smooth out distribution flow, especially since we can expect the annual one punk quarter (see next)(6) No, they won't reverse the reserve for turnaround costs.  They may even increase it since they've been running flat out for longer.  They may/may not prioritize paydown of the debt stub(7) As noted last quarter, UAN/Rentech has -never- paid out more than 3-3.50 (adjusted) IIRC and it's an MLP, not a closed end vehicle or royalty vehicle...i.e. management is not obligated to disburse all distributable cash. Think like a partner.(8) While no one knows Carl's mind, history suggests that he's around long-term, which implies a preference for a stable cash stream.  But that's just guessing about what's in a black box. That said, I still envision $10+ annual distribution rate (allowing for the annual turnaround and seasonality  punk quarter) and therefore a target price of $100-120.More,Roger H.,,7,1

Europe has been hard hit by the natural gas crunch, which has forced a number of nitrogen-fertilizer plants to halt or curtail production, including the likes of Norway’s Yara International ASA and top European chemicals company BASF SE. The gas makes up 80% of the cost to produce the nutrients and prices are four to five times higher than normal, according to industry group Fertilizers Europe. Local farmers are already fretting about securing enough supplies for the spring. Any scarcity risks curbing grain yields and quality in the European Union, the world’s biggest wheat exporter and a major barley supplier. Any drops in output could add to concerns about rising food prices.Corn prices have been rebounding over $5.50 a bushel, well over the five-year average around $4.34. A benchmark North American fertilizer price index rose 0.4% to $1,017.87 per short ton Friday, still teetering close to a record reached earlier this month.Farmers in the U.S. have pulled back slightly on fall fertilizer use, and retailers are now only buying what they need for the immediate future, said Alexis Maxwell, an analyst at Green Markets, a business owned by Bloomberg. The rush to buy fertilizer for the spring won’t come until around February.“So now we wait and see,” Maxwell said. “Do rest of the world prices fall to meet the U.S., or does the U.S. eventually jump up to meet the rest of the world?”Related: Food Prices Poised to Surge With Fertilizer at Highest in Years(Updates with corn prices in paragraph five.)©2021 Bloomberg L.P.AdvertisementMore,GoodTrade,,3,0

5 months ago,ANKENY, Iowa (DTN) -- Fear regarding rising prices and limited supplies of nitrogen, along with a fast harvest, could entice producers to apply more anhydrous ammonia this fall than usual and before the soil is fit.Some anhydrous ammonia application has begun in fields where soil temperatures are still above 50 degrees Fahrenheit. That makes the popular corn nitrogen (N) fertilizer more vulnerable to leaching, which can reduce availability for next year's corn crop and pollute water sources.Nutrient specialists and agronomists understand why producers may want to buy and inject anhydrous ammonia as soon as possible, but they urge farmers to hold off applications until conditions are right or until spring."Please try to wait until soil temperatures are consistently below 50 and dropping and use a nitrification inhibitor," said Lowell Gentry, a University of Illinois agronomist and nitrogen and drainage tile researcher. "There might not be a big yield impact (not following either practice), but there can be a significant impact on water quality."Gentry called this fall the "perfect storm" for early anhydrous ammonia application -- and more of it. Here's why.-- Anhydrous price has nearly doubled to tripled within the past year, according to DTN fertilizer price data and farmers.More,richard,,4,0

6 months ago,Nice trendOMAHA (DTN) -- Retail fertilizer prices are pushing considerably higher once again, according to prices tracked by DTN for the fourth week of September 2021.Five of the eight major fertilizers saw significant price increases, which DTN designates #$%$ or higher, compared to last month.Leading the way was potash, which was 13% higher compared to last month. The fertilizer had an average price of $647/ton.Urea was 11% more expensive than the prior month. The nitrogen fertilizer had average price of $620/ton. It is the first time urea crossed the $600/ton threshold in nine years. The last time it was this expensive was the second week of September 2012 when the nutrient was $605/ton.Both UAN32 and MAP were 6% higher compared to last month. UAN32 had an average price of $444/ton while MAP was at $800/ton. MAP is now at $800/ton for the first time since the third week of December 2009, when the price was $802/ton. The current price of the phosphorus fertilizer is the fifth highest price in the history of the nearly 13-year-old DTN data.UAN28 is 5% more expensive compared to a month prior. The nitrogen fertilizer has an average price of $388/ton.The average price of DAP and anhydrous increased 4% to $722/ton and $782/ton respectively.More,richard,,3,0

6 months ago,DTN Retail Fertilizer TrendsMAP Fertilizer Price Hits $800 Per Ton as Retail Prices Spike10/6/2021 | 9:42 AM CDTRuss QuinnThese record or near-record high retail fertilizer prices could be present through next spring. This was the conclusion of a recent North Dakota State University (NDSU) news release ().Dave Franzen, NDSU Extension soil science specialist, said he expects fertilizer price to stay at these price levels or continue rising through next spring."China has supplied about a third of the world's phosphate and it has essentially banned exports through 2022," Franzen said. "That puts the burden of supply on other countries, including the United States." (For more, please read: )The U.S. is not in a great position to expand mines and production due to environmental concerns, he said. This means fertilizer prices will continue to rise at least through 2022.Franzen recommends farmers consider soil sampling, use nitrogen calculators and consider whether fall nitrogen applications are wise. With phosphorus fertilizer, he suggests producers be more efficient when applying the fertilizer by working it into the soil or even applying the nutrient with a drill or air-seeder to limit the effects of water or wind movement."The most important strategy to use for potassium in North Dakota is to follow the NDSU recommendations for potassium for each crop, soil test by zone and use the North Dakota potassium calculator for corn to avoid any excessive and futile potassium application," he said.Retail fertilizer prices compared to a year ago show all fertilizers have increased significantly.10-34-0 is now 40% more expensive, DAP is 64% higher, urea is 71% more expensive, MAP is 74% higher, UAN32 is 78% more expensive, UAN28 is 83% higher, anhydrous 84% is more expensive and potash is 92% higher compared to last year.More,L,,2,0

7 months ago,CF went Force majeure suspending nitrogen deliveries on Sept 3 but it doesnt make the news until the 7th?We kind of suspected - but, still.(Bloomberg) -- Fertilizer prices are soaring after the world’s largest nitrogen facility had to declare a force majeure.CF Industries Holdings Inc. said on Sept. 3 that it can’t fill orders from its Donaldsonville, Louisiana, nitrogen complex, which was closed ahead of Hurricane Ida, according to a letter seen by Bloomberg. That’s stoking fears of production losses at a time when supplies are already tight.Fertilizer prices are already high, and that’s adding to increasing costs for farmers, who are paying more for everything from land and seeds to equipment. The higher costs of production may mean more food inflation is on the way. Global fertilizer costs touched near-decade highs in recent weeks, becoming expensive enough where growers may have to curb purchases.Prices for urea, a type of nitrogen fertilizer, in New Orleans are spiking in part due to “uncertainty surrounding the restart of CF’s Donaldsonville plant,” as well as when other plants will receive electricity, Scotiabank analyst Ben Isaacson said in a note Tuesday.The giant Donaldsonville complex consists of 19 plants including six ammonia and five urea facilities, making nitrogen-based products for agricultural and industrial markets. The plant is located in Ascension Parish, where over 2,700 customers were still out of power as of Tuesday morning, and should have power restored later in the day, according to an update from Entergy Corp.CF Industries did not respond to a request for an update of the status of the plant Tuesday.

If CF’s UAN manufacturing is also going to be down for1 to 2 months, and we head into the high  demand season for 2022 planting, and corn prices stay elevated, well, the price of UAN fertilizer has to go higher, and perhaps A LOT higher.

7 months ago,Yes, fertilizer prices today are high.  Will they stay high?  That's the thousand dollar question.  We know that if UAN fertilizer stays above $300/ton, UAN the MLP is going to distribute around $20 per year, give or take.  This is clear.  However, if UAN fertilizer falls back to $150/ton, then UAN the MLP probably heads back toward zero distribution.  So it's the future price of fertilizer that is the issue now, as far as I can tell the price of fertilizer is still heading higher, and by November we'll be heading into buying for the 2022 spring planting season, and that seasonal period generally pushes prices higher.  So, I guess we UAN MLP unit owners just have to sit here and collect our ~$5.00 per quarter distributions until the rest of the world comes to realize what a cash machine we are sitting on here.......More,Geezer31,,3,0

The tariffs are moving forward, so it's unlikely Russian or Trinidad/Tobago UAN will be shipped into US markets going forward, and that should push prices higher.  The completed debt refinance will have $4 million per quarter interest expense savings going forward.  The news looks great.  In this type of environment it's easy to see UAN paying $15 per year, or perhaps more, up to even $25 per year is possible.  The rest of the world will know this by summer 2022.  I think the units are highly undervalued, and if UAN prices climb from Q4 on (as they normally do) the unit price is insanely low.

Bob Spratt, manager of LeRoy Fertilizer Services located in LeRoy, Illinois, told DTN a storm could be brewing with a possible limited supply of crop nutrients."I have not seen a fertilizer market like this ever -- even in the 2008 market," Spratt told DTN. "We are going to face supply issues like never before, I feel."The supply issues aren't related to COVID-19 (although the worldwide pandemic probably hasn't helped any) but they are related to other issues. These include the draining of the fertilizer supply chain in 2020, the chemical plant shutdowns from the freeze in Texas last February and the lack of available fertilizer imports, he said.Spratt said there just is no advantage to importing fertilizer into the U.S. right now."The question is: Will we be able to get fertilizer when we need it?" he said.

8 months ago,Early trading does show some weakness fir UAN. One factor might be that the 2d quarter EPS was $.66 yet the declared distribution was so much more ($1.72).

Maybe the CC will reveal more insight.,Gregory,,1,1
8 months ago,Well lets see.  There's a $15m charge to recapture previous losses.  And there's $8m charge for the debt refinance.  And the interest expense should go down by $4m next quarter.  That's $27m, or about $2.50 per Q that can be in future distributions.  The question remains though, why were UAN's realized prices for UAN fertilizer and ammonia significantly below the NOLA prices and lower than the Key Market Indicators in the press release?  Remove the charges, lower the interest expense, and sell fertilizer at market prices (how hard is that??) and it seems like $5.00 per unit is reasonable each quarter.More,Geezer31,,9,0

9 months ago,Good read Investigation shows scale of big food corporations' market dominance and political powerIllustrations by Julia Louise PereiraA handful of powerful companies control the majority market share of almost 80% of dozens of grocery items bought regularly by ordinary Americans, new analysis reveals.A joint investigation by the Guardian and Food and Water Watch found that consumer choice is largely an illusion – despite supermarket shelves and fridges brimming with different brands.In fact, a few powerful transnational companies dominate every link of the food supply chain: from seeds and fertilizers to slaughterhouses and supermarkets to cereals and beers.The size, power and profits of these mega companies has expanded thanks to political lobbying and weak regulation which enabled a wave of unchecked mergers and acquisitions. This matters because the size and influence of these mega-companies enables them to largely dictate what America’s 2 million farmers grow and how much they are paid, as well as what consumers eat and how much our groceries cost.More,richard,,2,0

9 months ago,From AgWeb articleVery interesting Almost half a billion dollars is buried at the bottom of the Mississippi River, and the U.S. soybean industry is confident the vast sum is waiting at a depth of 50’. A massive effort is underway to dredge the lower Mississippi along its final 250-mile stretch, and the results could provide major financial benefits to American farmers.At ports along the mouth of the Mississippi, most ships loading soybeans can presently carry a maximum of 2.4 million bushels, and any additional weight in the hold puts the vessels in danger of scraping the riverbed. However, a mere extra 5’ in depth allows a ship to squeeze in 2.9 million bushels, and gain greater carrying power, at a marginal increase in transport costs to the vessel. Translation: Digging the depth of the lower Mississippi from 45’ to 50’ could generate an extra $461 million annually for the U.S. soybean industry—independent of supply and demand, and strictly based on efficiency of transport.More,richard,,3,3

9 months ago,PubliusToday, 7:53 AMContributorPremiumComments (2.77K)|There have been endless posts on both of my articles basically asking "if CVR is so great, why is the price so low?" Well, I have given a slew of reasons, but one of the biggest is the failure of Wall St. analysts to comprehend what is going on in the fertilizer markets (not to mention grain markets). This is compounded by the lack of any coverage of CVR.But Credit Suisse covers CVR Energy (CVI) and provides estimates for "the nitrogen business" as part of their analysis. Well, last night, CS put out an update on CVI, and as part of that, they said that for Q2, the nitrogen business would generate $61MM of EBITDA. That's their number for CVR as of today. I have EBITDA of $115MM for the quarter. I did some calculations to figure out how they got there, and the answer is UAN prices of just under $200 and ammonia at $395. Is this possible? Well, those were the prices back in January. So if CVR sold 100% of its inventory and 2nd quarter production back in January, their numbers could be correct. Did CVR do this? Of course not.So this is a perfect example of how divorced from reality Wall St. is when it comes to fertilizers in general and CVR in particular. But the real money is coming, and we are only about a month away now.LikeMore,GoodTrade,,0,0

9 months ago,PubliusToday, 7:49 AMContributorPremiumComments (2.73K)|There is some incredibly bullish news on nitrogen fertilizer pricing for the rest of the year. All of the Wall St. analysts as well as farmers had been expecting a significant to huge drop in prices for the traditional "summer fill" programs and that prices would continue dropping for the rest of the year. Well, they were wrong. Way, way wrong.Nutrien announced its summer fill program for UAN on Thursday with a discount of $20 per ton from current pricing. That means $280 at NOLA and $30-60 higher than NOLA at its Midwest plants. For CVR, this would translate to about $325 per ton from its plants. Now, CVR is not bound by this pricing, but they have always been a price follower, not a price leader, so I would expect their prices to be in this range. Also, it should be noted that this "discount" from Nutrien is only good for commitments made until July 1 (unless they sell out before that) for delivery in July-September. After that, the prices for Q4 delivery go back up by the same $20. They made the comment that given the market, they thought that these prices were "very reasonable."For Ammonia, CF has put out its summer fill programs as well. For its Illinois plant, it offered NH3 at $565 a ton, and sold out in 3 days. In Oklahoma (their closest plant to Coffeyville) they offered it at $560, but for a very limited number of tons. In Nebraska and Iowa, they didn't offer any summer delivery program at all, but instead offered 4th quarter "fill" pricing at $640 and $650 respectively. Since Ammonia peaked at $640 a few weeks ago, they are pricing Autumn "fill" at new highs. I've never seen such a thing before.A couple of points here. These fill programs are all for very limited tons. This tells me that they have already sold some (if not all) July delivery tons at Spring prices and that they are going to price 4th quarter products at greater than current pricing. This is WAY more than I had been expecting, even in my most optimistic projections. And now with actual prices (and sales), I would expect that Wall St. will have to start changing their price decks for the rest of the year.Another point of reference here. In my previous projections, I had been assuming that CVR would get $510 for its summer ammonia and $600 in the Autumn. For UAN, I had been projection $290 for the summer and $320 for the Fall. Obviously I was way low.Now, I would be remiss if I didn't also mention that natural gas prices have soared to over $3.50. My previous projections had been at an average of $3.10, but I have now raised that to $3.60. This will cost CVR $0.25 per unit each quarter from my earlier projections. I have no idea whether this is a spike or just the start of a much bigger run-up, but I will adjust as necessary. The good news on this is that while over the last 12 months, natural gas prices in the US have gone from $1.70 to $3.50, in Europe they have gone from $2 to over $11. This makes Europe's nitrogen production that much more expensive, and puts a vastly higher floor on nitrogen pricing. Similar numbers have been happening with coal in China, but European plants have become the marginal producers and so that is the most important thing now.I have re-run my projections for 3rd and 4th quarters based on these numbers and have gotten DCF numbers for both quarters of about $8.25 per quarter. 4th quarter pricing is higher, but CVR will Turnaround the Coffeyville plant then which will cost $9MM for turnaround costs, about $5MM for expansion capital expenses and probably a $15MM loss of EBITDA from the reduced production. I have not done a new projection for 1Q22, but obviously with 4th quarter pricing and no turnaround costs you would get about $2-3 more in DCF for the quarter if they sold out all of their production. Which is normally about what you would expect, but after what happened this year (also what happened in 1Q19) I am reluctant to project sales volumes at this point.)So there we are. If CVR had any Wall St. coverage (where are you Jeffreys?) it would skyrocket on this news. I will be curious to see whether CF's or NTR's analysts say anything about this today. They will have to at some point, but I wonder when they will get around to it.Best to everyone.LikeMore,GoodTrade,,0,0

The average gate price for the year is $295/t (remember, Midwest sells at a premium to NOLA). If CVR Partners meets their operating targets, I’ve assumed 95% utilization for the rest of 2021, current commodity prices support 2021 EBITDA of $294 MM. Using a historical multiple of 8.0x EV / EBITDA implies an EV of $2,348 MM. Figure 2: Fertilizer Operations EVI’ve provided a sensitivity table at the end so that you can change the assumptions and come up with your own view on value.Debt Refinancing (9.25% Callable Notes)On June 8, CVRP announced a partial redemption for its $645MM 9.25% senior secured notes due 2023. The company intends to call $550MM of these notes leaving a $95MM stub outstanding. As expected, CVRP will use the proceeds from the 45Q monetization to pay off the remaining $95MM of the 2023 notes once that transaction is complete. Moody’s Rating Action note confirms this (You don’t need to register. Just scroll and hit “I agree”). At the same time, the company placed $550MM of 6.125% senior secured notes due 2028. This is a fantastic rate to issue 7-year notes. In addition to reducing interest expense, these notes will secure the company’s financing needs for the foreseeable future. The result of this first step, prior to monetizing the 45Q’s, is an annual interest savings of $17MM per year. That’s an additional annual distribution of $1.62 per unit.45Q Monetization (Current Legislation)The company is still working on monetizing the 45Q credits. The $95MM 9.25% stub gives a good indication of where management feels the 45Q valuation floor is. My calculation has the value at $113MM for the ’21-’25 credits. I tested the value for a range of discount rates and found the escalating nature of the credits on a $/t basis reduces the sensitivity of the PV to various discount rates. For comparison’s sake, I have the ’21-’25 credits valued at $104-$124MM using 5% to 15% respectively. What will management do with the remaining proceeds? There are a number of one-off expenses they could use the funds for such as underwriting/transaction fees for the debt/45Qs, the second $10MM buyback announced, or the $4-$6MM growth capex in 2021 (see slide 14 of latest presentation). In a worst case they can reserve the funds for the one-off costs. Alternatively, they may pay it out as distributions. Regardless of that decision, taking out the stub reduces the interest expense by an additional $8.8MM. That’s cash that can go straight to unit holders in the form of an additional $0.83 distribution per year. When you add this to the annual interest savings from the debt refinance, the result is $2.45/unit of perpetual distributions that are uncorrelated with operations and commodity prices. Figure 3: 45Q Monetization ValueProposed 45Q AmendmentNo major updates here. After the initial bipartisan bill proposed on March 25, 2021, there have been a number of proposals and discussions on these – some positive, some negative. The fact that both political parties have incentives to continue with the 45Q credits is positive, but it’s too early to say with certainty what the 45Q regime will evolve to. I’ve included the breakdown of the proposal so that you can run your own calculations if changes are announced.

Then, it's refi news release, the Q2 large cash distributions....and then it's UAN to the moon! UAN is the best chart and best scenario I've ever traded. From SA today.... PubliusToday, 5:33 AMComments (2.56K)Urea was up huge yesterday. Huge. UAN was only up modestly, but UAN always trails urea in price. It definitely looks like there will be no summer reset in nitrogen prices, and it is now likely that the summer fill price for urea will be higher than the Spring pricing. That has NEVER happened before and is a pretty good indication that: 1) Demand well exceeds supply, worldwide, as well as in the US and 2) Since summer fill nitrogen won't be applied until next spring (for Fall 2022 harvest crops), the market has realized that this year's corn harvest will not meet the demand and even more nitrogen will be needed next year, and 3) Since nitrogen bought in the summer has to be stored at a significant cost until next spring, prices next Spring will be much higher than they are now.I know that when I wrote this new article, as much as things had improved since my first article, many people were still skeptical that the price increases were anything more than a blip. Well, its not a dip. Summer prices at this level virtually guarantee another full year of huge prices. And given the supply and demand situation for corn worldwide, it seems pretty clear to me that this will mean several more years of ever increasing pricesMore,GoodTrade,,0,0

10 months ago,Prices for nitrogen fertilizers are now getting so high that middle east shipment into the US is becoming economic..............Urea prices rally: PWNI continues to make strong gains, closing in on highs reached in MarchMay 28, 2021General, Nitrogen, Profercy World Nitrogen Index	The Profercy World Nitrogen Index has continued its rapid ascent, this week climbing by over 8 points, the largest weekly increase seen since early February, and nearing highs last seen in March this year.All products across the nitrogen-complex remain firm. Urea values in particular are racing ahead of other nitrogen products and showing no signs of letting up in the near term.In the urea market, participants were focused on the outcome of the third purchasing tender of the current campaign from India. RCF received offers for 1.49m. tonnes of urea, the lowest volume offered in the last three tenders.The timing of the tender and the shipment window implied a target of 0.7-1.2m. tonnes, however, after submitting counter offers at the lowest offer levels of $408.88pt cfr on the east coast, and $418pt cfr on the west coast, reports suggest that RCF has today received award acceptances for around 565,000t. It is likely that India will need to enter the market again soon to make up for the shortfall and build up stocks ahead of the upcoming peak seasonal demand.The presence of India in the market continues to have a positive impact on urea values globally.In China, producers and suppliers raised price ideas ahead of the latest Indian purchasing tender. Prilled urea offers were heard at $380-385pt fob, up more than $10pt on last week, while granular urea offers were at $395-400pt fob for June/July shipment.Buoyed by the bullish international sentiment, in the Middle East values have also advanced with offers into the latest Indian tender from two producers at $390-396pt fob. While the low RCF fob counter offer was rejected by the producers, contract business to western markets continues to provide good returns and producers in the region are confident demand from the west will provide outlets for June and July shipments.Egyptian granular urea prices surpassed the $400pt fob mark, with a large volume sold midweek for August over $405pt fob. The majority of producers in the region are now mostly sold out for June and July, and with demand from Latin America expected to continue, the upwards pressure on prices remains.Heading west, values in the US Gulf barge market also advanced, with increased demand for prompt material pushing both loaded and May barge values some $34-39ps ton higher from the lowest levels heard a week ago. Values for June also climbed higher, with participants remaining optimistic over demand heading into the US offseason.Brazilian cfr values have climbed higher again this week, gaining $15pt from last week.Owing to the rapid advance in urea values, the Profercy World Nitrogen Index gained 8.27 points this week to 182.06. This is the third consecutive week the Index has climbed, gaining over 17 points and recouping on losses that were made in late March and April.By Neha Popat, Nitrogen Market ReportMore,halv,,4,1

11 months ago,Hang on. The next jump-up will be any day. Remember, very solid analysis points to $200 to $300 per unit this year. Corn is going crazy again today and the refi is coming. Also, from another site:..."With the pending refi, I'd expect UAN to publish a new investor presentation in the next few weeks, in front of a virtual debt roadshow. In 2016, the company published a new slide deck on 5/16/16 in front of the 9.25% debt roadshow (mid June pricing). While the roadshow will be geared toward credit investors, very often the potential refi investors also work at shops that run equity money. While UAN's LP structure limits would-be buyers, I suspect the debt roadshow will turn out as a positive for the equity, all else equal.".... So, some are thinking it's had a great run up and will retract. Well, that theory was tested over the last few days. UAN dropped over 20% and then shot back up 20% on a shaky but understandable Q1 report. It dropped so fast and rose so fast that many could not take advantage of the dip. That's it, all the bad is known, the plant shutdown from the weather, the presales etc... and UAN, which grew from $6/unit to $56/unit in 6 months, basically burped! Do your own DD.

Was called an uneducated investor and scoffed at. Well looks like the so called experts on this board put their foot in their mouths. Should have taken management into account and other factors since 2013 in their analysis.,Mike,,5,0
11 months ago,Ok production volumes in Q1 and realized sale prices in Q1 were very weak.  So....how hard is it to fix those two “problems”?  The sales price fixes itself.  Price today are very high.  All UAN management needs to do is sell some fertilizer at today’s prevailing price.  It’s double or more what they received in Q1.  Problem solved!  Low production and numbers, can they fix that?  Sure, why not?  The plants are both forecast to run at 95% to 100% capacity in Q2.  I’d say the production volume “problem” is already fixed.  Sales volume?  Demand for fertilizer is super high, they can sell everything they produce.  Which raises the following question.  When UAN produces and sells UAN fertilizer and ammonia in the maximum feasible volumes for the current market price.....something that will soon happen.....do you want to own the units, or not?  I do.  And so, I sit and wait.More,Geezer31,,4,0
11 months ago,So can someone explain to me how you have 1 plant down for 5 of 90 days (6%) and the other plant doesnt go down at all, and they produced 16% less UAN and sold 41% less ammonia.

What did they presell all of their inventory at the lowest prices on record?  Thats about the only way this could have happened.  I love the fundamentals of the business right now, but the execution by management continues to be about as bad as I have ever seen on a stock I follow.  Now we get to see our accounts drained dry again tomorrow as I sit here looking at 20% down in after hours..................  I think this thing could fall more before it finds its footing again.

11 months ago,So, I just bought 1k more shares on the dip today.  Why, since I already have a bunch from when it was less than $10/share? Well, for several reasons.  First off, since around 2014 the price of corn has been in the $4/bushel range. It was only in the $6-8 range from 2010 to 2013. Right now, it's around $6/bushel - and will probably keep rising this year because of the droughts in Brazil, Uroguay, Argentina, and even in the western US.  There is unrest in the Ukraine and China is trying to replace hogs.  All of that suggests, at least to me, an even stronger demand for fertilizer for the remainder of this year and into early next year at least. Now, the last time prices were at these levels (2011-2013) the price of UAN was between $200-$300/share and was paying a $4-$6/share dividend per quarter.  So, it seems quite likely to me that UAN will still continue to increase significantly from this point moving forward - at least through the rest of this year. I wouldn't be surprised if it passes the $100 by this Fall...More,Sean,,1,0

11 months ago,Article to be posted this weekend, found on reddit: Stock PickIf you have been following me on Twitter you have probably been seeing my tweets how the price of corn is skyrocketing right now. To take advantage of the rising price of corn I have uncovered a stock idea that I think could double or more from significant operating leveraged tied to higher corn prices.Meet CVR Partners (“UAN”).Here is the quick run-down:A master limited partnership that manufacturers and sells nitrogen fertilizers in the United States. Nitrogen fertilizers are used in crops such as corn and beans.The business model has an extremely high fixed cost nature to it. During times of rising prices CVR will print money. In low price environment this bites on the way down.When the price of corn is up this will give incentives to farmers to use more. The price of UAN NOLA has begun skyrocketing, up to $278/ton from $134/ton in just December.Assuming UAN NOLA prices hold steady (I think they increase going forward given the price action of corn) CVR will begin to make a significant amount of money as costs will stay relatively stable. I estimate 2021 EBITDA could be north of $200 million at current prices.CVR is estimated to receive over $300 million in tax benefits for carbon sequestration efforts from Section 45Q.There are 9.25% Callable Notes that are callable in June of 2021. If CVR refinances these notes in the 5% range this will add over $250 million in value to CVR. Proceeds from Section 45Q could amplify this.During the last upcycle CVR had an equity value of $320/unit, with 60% less capacity and nitrogen prices were the same as spot prices now.I am substantially long CVR and plan to write it up in more detail to paying subscribers this weekend.

Photographer: Shannon VanRaes/Bloomberg © 2020 BLOOMBERG FINANCE LPBetter stock up on corn flakes while you can still afford them.An exceptionally weak harvest in Brazil and a likely U.S. drought this year should propel corn prices even higher by the end of the year.December-dated futures contracts for corn were recently fetching $5.69 a bushel on the CME. That’s up from less than $4.90 at the beginning of April, according to CME data. The Teucrium Corn exchange-traded fund (ticker: CORN), which holds a basket of corn futures, performed similarly.At least part of that rip-your-face-off rally is the likely disastrous second corn crop from the world’s second largest exporter. “Currently, the corn market is pricing in a failed 2nd crop Brazil production number and greatly reduced forward looking exports,” states a recent report from Hackett Financial Advisors.PROMOTED“Blow Off Top” Coming Soon For Corn MarketThe good news is that there is likely to be a pause in the current rally during May, which will then give way to to another massive rally in the summer, according to Hackett. The report states:“We should have a pause in May from which a final blow off top on escalating US drought fears that we have been predicting will occur in July  [...]”A blow-off top is characterized by “a steep and rapid” increase in trading volume and price, followed by a steep reversal, according to financial website Investopedia.MORE FOR YOUBest Stocks To Buy Today As Dow Jumps Amid Vaccine NewsLumber’s Latest Price Rally Signals Stronger-For-Longer Spring PricesThe World’s Largest Soybean Exporter Wants To Import Soybeans. What Happened?The Hackett report continues: “[...] end users should look [to] buy any breaks that may occur in what should be ideal planting weather in the U.S. in May.”May Is the Time to Buy Corn Futures, says HackettIn other words, prices should dip in May with the prospect of a good harvest followed by drought in the summer which will then give way to a monster rally. During that dip anyone who needs to buy corn, such as livestock farmers, might want to purchase some December-dated futures contracts. Likewise, risk tolerant trader may wish to do the same or buy the Teucrium corn ETF.Hackett’s report says the likely summer corn market action won’t be the end of the good times for the corn market.“[The likely rally this summer] is only the first part with the second act of the play to reaching even higher levels come the Spring/Summer of 2022 when an unimaginable long cold and snowy winter places its mark on Northern Hemisphere production potential.”In other words, this summer c ould just be the warm up for the main event.More,GoodTrade,,0,0

last year,Retail fertilizer prices continued to rise the last week of March 2021, according to sellers surveyed by DTN. But for the first time in many weeks, some fertilizers moved just slightly higher instead of considerably higher.While all eight of the major fertilizer were again higher, only five fertilizers moved significantly higher, which DTN designates #$%$ or more.Continuing to lead the way to the high side was UAN28, which was again up 34% from last month and had an average price of $340 per ton. UAN32 was 24% more expensive compared to the prior month and had an average price of $377/ton.Anhydrous was up 22% compared to last month and had an average price of $685/ton; 10-34-0 was 7% higher compared to the prior month and had average price of $599/ton.Urea was 6% more expensive than the prior month and had an average price of $502/ton. Urea was above the $500/ton level for the first time since the first week of November 2014 when the price was at $500/ton.The remaining three fertilizers were higher again, but these fertilizers saw just slight price increases.MAP had an average price of $697/ton, potash at $429/ton and DAP $618/ton.On a price per pound of nitrogen basis, the average urea price was at $0.55/lb.N, anhydrous $0.42/lb.N, UAN28 $0.61/lb.N and UAN32 $0.59/lb.N.Higher retail fertilizer prices are naturally on farmers? mind right now and rightful so. In a Minnesota Crop News article from March 30 titled ?Why Corn Growers Shouldn?t Overreact to Rising Nitrogen Fertilizer Prices,? author and Extension educator Brad Carlson wrote that these prices have growers wondering if they should adjust their nitrogen fertility plan for the 2021 growing season.Carlson believes the short answer is ? probably not. He points to the Maximum Return to Nitrogen (MRTN) method of figuring the appropriate N rates for corn. The price ratio of the MRTN is a simple calculation of the current cost of N fertilizer (per pound) divided by the price of corn. If, for example, N is $0.25 per pound and corn is $2.50 per bushel (bu), the price ratio is 0.10. If the price of N is $0.25 and corn is $5, the price ratio is 0.05.?If the price of N is $0.50/lbs. and corn is $5/bu, the price ratio is 0.10, meaning the rate suggestions are the same as they were at $0.25/lbs. of N and the corn price of $2.50/bu.,? Carlson wrote.It is important to put the current situation in context with what has happened in the past, considering the rapid increase in fertilizer price. A closer look reveals the current ration of N price to corn price is in line with the historical relationship, he said.If growers are following the guidelines for the 0.10 price ratio, there is little justification for modifying N rates due to the recent spike in retail fertilizer prices. Carlson did add if someone was applying a significantly higher N rate than the MRTN, this would be a good time to dial back the N application and save some money this growing season.With retail fertilizer prices moving higher over recent months, all fertilizers are now higher in price from a year ago.Potash is now 16% more expensive, 10-34-0 is 28% higher, urea is 31% more expensive, UAN32 36% higher, anhydrous is 39% more expensive, UAN28 is 44% higher, DAP is 52% more expensive and MAP 61% is higher compared to last year.More,Brubeans,,2,0

last year,What's the probability of a stock going from $6 to $100 in a year? How many standard deviations beyond one are we talking about, 4 or 5? The bull case is entirely predicated on the assumption of demand being much greater than supply for several years out and the assumption that past valuations and multiples should apply this time around like they did before. What's actually different: 1) The whole market is in the biggest bubble since the tech bubble of 2000, 2) Money is free (exceptionally low interest rates spurning wild speculations and valuations), 3) CVR went through 4 years of losses, underperformance and near delisting, all of which made the vulnerabilities of the business model and the large debt much more apparent, 4) farming practices continue to evolve toward more targeted and efficient fertilizer applications, 5) Some say it's a new commodities super cycle while others say it's a devaluation of the dollar and inflation, 6) China won't ever export fertilizer to the US again (that's the assumption), 7) etc. Typically, stocks soar when price and volume are increasing while volatility is decreasing. In the case of UAN (recently) price is increasing, volume is decreasing and volatility is increasing. This is usually indicative of a head fake rather than a soar-to-the-moon scenario. Is this episodic or a trend? We don't know. Meanwhile we sit in the midst of far higher risk (at the moment) than the perma bulls could dare to comprehend. If we break through $50 with ease sometime in the next week or two, and stay there, the bull narrative has roots. If we muck around sub $50 or retreat to $30, this could fall apart teens again. The two most important indicators to follow each day are the corn futures prices and the NOLA uan futures contracts, at least till we get some real information from the next CC.More,halv,,3,1

Last year when I started buying UAN it was because I believed ethanol demand was going to drive corn higher and thus UAN. It turned out a plethora of other factors pushed corn to 8-year highs over a few months. Now...ethanol demand is kicking in. UAN's time is now.... we will hit $100, and probably $200, with an outside chance of $300/unit by year's end.

I'm 95% sure about the $100/unit and I'm 75% sure of the $200. $300 is where UAN was trading last time corn/fertilizers were this high, so make your own judgment there.Corn holds gains on tight supply ahead of USDA reportCorn near eight-year high.Brisk demand and weather risks in focus.USDA report awaited on US corn and soy stocks.Wheat futures firm on corn spillover, spring weather threats.Soybeans little changed.Reuters Updated 09 Apr 2021FacebookTwitterWhatsappCommentsPARIS/SINGAPORE: Chicago corn edged higher on Friday, holding on to sharp gains from the previous session as strong demand and weather risks kept the focus on tight supply ahead of closely watched US government forecasts.Wheat continued to track strength in corn while also finding support in adverse weather in some growing regions.Soybeans were little changed as traders adjusted positions before the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) monthly supply and demand report at 1600 GMT.The most active corn contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) was up 0.3% at $5.81-1/4 a bushel by 1130 GMT, trading close to last week's almost eight-year peak of $5.85.Corn climbed on Thursday after the US Energy Information Administration reported corn-based ethanol stocks at the lowest level since November and as rain forecast for much of the US Midwest threatened to hamper planting.The need to replenish ethanol stocks could add to strain on corn supplies after a strong export season.Overseas demand has been boosted by rising Chinese imports.

Anxiety 101Close sticky video Trackerdslogo“The market is bit firm after the long weekend, but we feel any further gain in prices will depend on any issues with the U.S. weather,” said one Singapore-based feed grains trader.Most U.S. markets were closed on Friday for Good Friday.The most-active corn contract on the Chicago Board Of Trade (CBOT) added 0.2% to $5.60-3/4 a bushel by 0225 GMT, after hitting its highest since June 2013 at $5.85 a bushel on Thursday.Soybeans were unchanged at $11.35 a bushel and wheat was down 0.2% to $6.10 a bushel.U.S. farmers plan to sow 91.1 million acres with corn this year, the most since 2016, and 87.6 million acres with soybeans, the most since 2018, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said on Wednesday.However, both estimates were well below analysts’ expectations for 93.2 million corn acres and 89.996 million soybean acres.The USDA’s planting estimates have revived concern about tightening global supplies after importers led by China and domestic processors loaded up on grain and oilseeds this season.AdvertisementSTORY CONTINUES BELOWThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article contentChina released 2 million tonnes of rice from state reserves for sale to feed producers this week to bolster supplies of feed grains amid elevated corn prices, three sources close to the matter said.Corn prices hit record highs in China earlier this year as dwindling stocks and reduced output raised concerns over supplies.Wheat futures are facing pressure amid favorable growing conditions across the Northern Hemisphere.Ukraine’s APK-Inform agriculture consultancy said on Friday it saw the 2021 grain crop rising by 13% to 73.8 million tonnes, allowing the country to export 54.2 million tonnes of grain in the 2021/22 season that runs from July to June.The consultancy said the 2021 wheat harvest could rise by 10% to 27.5 million tonnes with exports of 19.8 million tonnes.Large speculators raised their net long position in CBOT corn futures in the week to March 30, regulatory data released on Friday showed.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s weekly commitments of traders report also showed that non-commercial traders, a category that includes hedge funds, increased their net short position in CBOT wheat and cut their net long position in soybeans.

last year,DTN recently asked the following poll question, “With some questions about fertilizer supply after a busy fall application season and retail prices climbing much higher during the last several months, what best describes your feeling toward the fertilizer situation currently?” Six different responses were given for the question.As of Tues. March 30, there were just under 200 responses. “I have locked in prices; I am not concerned” was the most popular selection with 35% of the votes.  The next popular response was “I have locked in prices; I am somewhat concerned” with 32% of the vote. Next was “I have locked in prices; I am extremely concerned” with 19% of the vote.DATA taken from Russ Quinn article.I know this is a small cross section of farmers, but having 86% of farmers saying that they locked in prices before this spike tells me that its likely that UAN hasnt captured as much as it could have if they just sold everything at the spot and probably locked in alot of their prices far too early.  That said, only 30% of farmers are not worried about the prices affecting them in the future it looks like, so at least most of the farmers are at least seeing higher fertilizers prices could be here for a while.  I do wish we could find out what the company sold the fertilizer at.  Count me as one who is very much anticipating the ER.More,Brubeans,,2,0

last year,It just keeps getting better! PubliusToday, 9:55 AMContributorComments (2.14K)|I wanted to point out some pricing information that I was sent over the weekend. Most of the sources that I use are NOLA pricing and almost all of the attention is to Urea. Just looking at those numbers for the last month or so would make it seem that Nitrogen prices have peaked and are rolling over a little.Nothing could be further from the truth, either for Inland pricing (what CVR actually gets) or for UAN in particular. Current prompt (spot) prices for UAN at East Dubuque are $340 per ton and at Coffeyville it's $350 per ton. I have never seen prices higher at Coffeyville, but since 73% of their UAN is sold out of Coffeyville, this is just getting better and better for CVR. For May and June, NOLA futures are indicating UAN to go down significantly, but no contracts have actually traded for those months for many many weeks now. The current (plant pricing) in the Midwest is indicated at $340 for May and June as well.For Ammonia, prices at both E. Dubuque and Coffeyville are at $630 per ton for prompt delivery.These numbers need to be put into perspective. In 2012 and 2013, which were the peak years for Nitrogen fertilizer, the annual average prices received by CVR for UAN was $303 and $282 per ton. For Ammonia, the prices were $613 and $643. Now current prices are not for the full year, but the reality is that these are pretty much the HIGHEST PRICES EVER RECEIVED by CVR. Back when those were the prices for fertilizer, CVR hit a (split adjusted) price of $320 per unit. I don't know what else I can say about this. CVR Partners at $45 today is even MORE underpriced than it was back when I wrote this article when the equity price was $25 per unit. That's because in that time, both ammonia and UAN prices have gone up so much so as to make CVR that much more profitable. So there you go.More,GoodTrade,,0,0

last year,"FYI, the other side of the story:Hedgeye recently introduced CF Industries as a Best Idea Short with a 40% downside opportunity by year end. CF Industries is a large anhydrous ammonia, granular urea and uan producer centered north of Chicago, Ill. Reasons for the short call include:Hedgeye believes the bullish commodity cycle will come to and end by year end as the economy moves into a phase of stagflation and declining GDP.Their survey of global Urea production indicates that while 2020 saw a lull in new worlwide capacity, additions are set to reaccelerate in 2021 and 2022.Hedgeye sees demand falling considerably by year end as new supply from worldwide sources floods the market late in 2021.On a longer term basis, they see demand decline for Nitrogen Fertilizers amid better technology including more precise applications and better efficacy of amino acid fertilizers.They see acreage changes typically as one year events that rise and fall dramatically and as poor indicators of supply/demand dynamics beyond the current season. They don't see the China issues (rebuilding the swine herd, dramatic corn imports, decreased UAN production due to shifting uses of coal in the country, etc.) as having any lasting effect on the current reduced worlwide uan supply.They see a dramatic shift in US ammonia output coming soon as the country shifts to a hydrogen future. H2 must be stored and transported and the best form for doing this is NH3 (ammonia). From their perspective, every green energy wind farm and hydroelectric generator will soon be adding electrolyzers for H2 and NH3 production making the current NG and petro coke sourcing for ammonia manufacturing relatively obsolete. Plus, ammonia generation will be "closer to home" in many situations adding competition to more regional producers. And, green sources will be able to tout ecological benefits. Hedgeye doesn't believe a hydrogen based energy system will ever really take hold in the US on a grand scale but in the meantime, the stored H2 in the form of ammonia will mean years of over supply versus demand."More,halv,,2,1

Someone I know was doing channel checks and called CVR's Coffeyville plant to get a quote. He was told that they had nothing to sell until the end of September. Which is kind of stunning to me. Now, I have no idea whether they sold everything this week or over the last couple of months. Or whether they have "soft" orders from existing clients that they feel obligated to reserve production for. But it definitely means that there will be no "summer fill" program this year. That is the time after Spring application season is over and fertilizer companies sell their summer production at steep discounts to those with adequate storage to hold it as inventory until it is needed in the late fall and following Spring. So CVR (or at least Coffeyville plant) has no production over the summer that they will have to discount. It tells me that the nitrogen market is even tighter than I thought and that prices will be staying high for as far as the eye can see.More,GoodTrade,,0,0

last year,So I went back and reviewed and in 2011-2013, UANs heyday, it traded somewhere between 8-10% yield on average.  Taking this value into account, I think the current price is predicting a $3-$4 distribution this year.  If the prices stay up, and the distribution exceeds that, then I would expect the price of the stock to go up with it.  If we get up to a $10-$12 distribution, then I think that a stock  price of $100 could potentially become a reality.  This quarter's distribution will be interesting as the price of the fertilizer was low on Jan 1, but it went up pretty quickly.  It they averaged a price closer to todays than Jan.1 price, then it could be pretty good.  I wont believe that until I hear it though.   Either way, at the current prices the distribution should easily exceed $3-$4 for the year which to me means the stock is undervalued.More,Brubeans,,6,0
last year,A lot of speculation and conversation here and there about UAN paying a distrubution at the end of this quarter of as much as $2 per unit and for 2021 as much as $13 per unit (not including savings from refi of debt and value of carbon sequestor credits - another $2-10). Since it seems unlikely to some the company will cough up that much to unit holders, what else would/could they do with distributable cash of that magnitude? Pay down debt? Buy back shares? Buy another fertilizer company to grow market share? Give huge bonuses to management? Give a special performance fee to CVI (Icahn)? Just trying to think my way around this great story to look at how this could all go south for the measely shareholder so only the big boys win. If it's really the story we longs think it is, why is no one looking? why do the shares flounder at the level they were at for 4+ years prior to late last year?More,halv,,3,0
last year,PubliusToday, 9:43 AMComments (2.08K)There have been a lot of comments on this article, and I have been sent a large number of private messages, wondering how CVR's equity price can be so low, if anything that I've said here is correct. I've tried to give a few reasons, but let me now delve into a big one.I've mentioned that there is a thought on Wall St. that current fertilizer prices are just a short term spike, and will head back down soon. Well, on Friday I received a price deck from one of the major houses, and it shows their projections for 2021 on a quarterly basis. I will only deal with UAN and ammonia here, since that is what CVR sells.For UAN, they have (NOLA) prices for the four quarters of 2021 as $190, $190, $160, $150. Now, the first quarter is over, and NOLA prices averaged $217, yet they haven't updated their numbers. For the second quarter, Spot prices are now $290, but if you take the average futures prices for the quarter, you get $262. For third quarter, the futures average $212. Now, any fertilizer company can sell at these prices, but most aren't because they think that they are going up.For Ammonia (Tampa price), the projections are $320 for Q1 and $380 for Q2. Actual Q1 (now over) was $348. Current price for all of April is $545.So, if you look at the projections, just against the reality of what prices ALREADY ARE, you see a huge disconnect. And these projections are from two days ago. These projected numbers are what the analyst is REQUIRED to base their earning projections on. So they have to get numbers that are way below what is going to happen. You can see this in their projections for CF, NTR and MOS, which partially explains why those stocks have not done nearly as well as they should have.Editing now to add that the difference between my (actual plus futures) prices and the analyst's price deck results is about $90MM less in EBITDA and DCF for 2021. I hope that that makes it clear one very big reason for the low equity price right now.Now, CVR is not covered by anyone on Wall St., so there is no direct effect here. But the whole sector is hopeless misunderstood right now. But after we have a couple of quarters at higher numbers, and managements and analysts reset to the new reality, we will see an explosion in all of these stocks, but especially CVR.More,GoodTrade,,8,1

Over the past five years, it's averaged $291/ton during this week. (DTN Chart)OMAHA (DTN) -- Retail fertilizer prices continue to push higher, although at a much slower clip than past weeks, according to locations tracked by DTN for the third week of March 2021. Only seven of the eight major fertilizers were up a significant amount, which DTN designates #$%$ or more, breaking a streak of six weeks in a row all eight were higher.The average retail price of UAN28 was up 35% from last month at $331/ton. UAN32 was 29% more expensive compared to the prior month with an average price of $373/ton.Anhydrous prices were 27% higher compared to a month ago at an average of $671/ton. 10-34-0 was up 14% with an average price of $596/ton.The remaining four fertilizers had slightly less sharp price spikes compared to the previous weeks.

University of Minnesota Extension Nutrient Management Specialist Dan Kaiser said he has talked to many growers this winter concerned about this issue.In response, Kaiser wrote an article for the Minnesota Crop News titled, "With Rising Fertilizer Prices, How Can Farmers Reduce Costs This Spring?" In it, he shared some tips for producers.The first thing he recommends would be to prioritize macronutrients over micronutrients. He said the simple fact is many farmers cannot afford to cut nutrient applications such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potash (K) and sulfur (S) for the sake of applying micronutrients because they likely will not have as high a return on investment."The $5 per acre you may spend on micronutrients would be better spent on nutrients which form the foundation of your nutrient management program," Kaiser wrote.Another important consideration would be to pay attention to P and K soils tests. Farmers can cut cost by skipping application where P and K are not needed and only applying these nutrients where they're essential for crop development, he wrote.A third recommendation would be to make sure you are accounting for all of the nutrients you are applying. Kaiser wrote some of the fertilizer products applied contain multiple nutrients, and thus, producers need to make sure to credit nutrients from all products.An example of this would be nitrogen in MAP and DAP. There is no simple answer as to how best to credit nitrogen from fall applications of MAP and DAP, he wrote."The earlier they were applied in the fall, the more likely it is that the ammonium will convert to nitrate which may be lost before it can be taken up by the crop in the spring," he wrote.He also said fertilizer enhancers and soil amendments can be risky investments and encouraged producers to stay up to date on the latest University of Minnesota Extension research ().

last year,THE BEAR CASE FOR UAN. This is a small company (market cap 373 M) that produces a comodity that cycles wildly between over supply and under supply, that has way to much debt, that nearly failed last year as it languished below $1 and was threatened with delisting. Following a 1 for 10 reverse split it has gone from $6 to $36, a six fod increase in 4.5 months and now sits at a valuation it flat lined at for the previous 4.5 years. The largest owner (Carl Icahn) has a history of indifference toward shareholders and management has a less than stellar track record at selling their product at prices that achieve maximum benefit to the bottom line. In a world of far sexier stocks, what about this stock really stands out to the uninformed investor that never reads Seeking Alpha and knows nothing of historical valuations. Is there any way to get this stock on the radar of a bigger audience when there is a sea of SPAC's, Tech's, Fintech's and Value Plays with better moats and much better balance sheets. This is what we're up against as shareholder longs.More,halv,,1,0

Bob Larson, Marketing Manager with Nutrien Ag Solutions, says increased demand for fertilizer started last fall and has continued to be strong pushing up prices.He says there are several other factors pushing fertilizer values, including higher corn prices and increased planted acreage expectations this spring. Plus, nitrogen fertilizer production has also been compromised with the recent cold snap and increased price of natural gas.Larson says prices for macronutrients like potash and phosphorus are also up. In fact, potash is 14% more expensive compared to last year. He says many plants are trying to restock their supplies which has been tough with the slower river traffic in the winter.The price of UAN28 is up 30% over last year at an average price of $306 per ton, while UAN32 is 24% higher at $344 per ton.

Both farmers and farm supply cooperatives are in strong financial positions at this moment.For cooperatives, CoBank sees a profitable spring agronomy season. Factors such as meaningful expansion in corn, soybean and wheat planted acres and rising fertilizer prices are positive for retailer margins.“Given higher acreage forecasts, we expect farmers to spend more money on traditional fertilization products, specifically the principal NPK macronutrients (i.e., nitrogen, potassium and phosphorous) during the spring growing season,” the CoBank report said.This demand follows a very strong post-harvest fall fertilizer application season (October to December 2020) in contrast to 2019, which had early and extreme winter weather. The increase in fertilizer demand has generally tracked the rise in grain prices, according to the report.The one factor that could create some issues for the upcoming planting season would be the recent cold and wet weather. This uncooperative weather could delay planting and create some logistical bottlenecks, which could cause some input shortages in certain parts of the country, the report said.With retail fertilizer prices moving higher over recent months, all fertilizers are now higher in price from a year ago.More,richard,,5,0
last year,My DD is telling me to buy on even the smallest dips. I've picked up a little more yesterday and today. After reverse-split last fall, hitting $30 was my minimum target based on assets alone. $50 was my next target even before fertilizer prices started climbing. Now, with fertilizers prices rocketing, and the announced plan for debt to be paid off with green credits, and the recent very solid analysis in reddit and SA, my new target for this year is over $100. So, I'm in conviction buying mode for UAN. We're talking broke-back mountain "I wish I could quit you" conviction. And, throughout my investing experience, I, so far, have done well when continuing to buy-in a climbing stock when DD supports this level of conviction. Hope I'm right!

last year,Most of us here are bullish on the UAN units as fertilizer prices have rocketed higher while the unit price has not.  When fertilizer prices were last at today’s levels (2011-2013) UAN was about $220.  So let’s play devil’s advocate.  What could go wrong? The main thing that could ruin the expected unit price appreciation is (I think) a collapse in fertilizer prices. All the crop current news and outlook is fairly strong, but that strength changing to weakness could happen, I suppose.  Other than that, I don’t see any likely scenarios that keep the unit price this low for months.  By Q2 at the latest distributions will begin gushing out of UAN, and the unit price will respond accordingly.More,Geezer31,,3,0

last year,Why fertilizer prices are through the roofTuesday, March 16th 2021, 3:08 PM CDTWe are getting a closer look at some reasons why fertilizer prices are through the roof.Ag Web reports that some farmers are paying as much as $700 dollars per ton of anhydrous ammonia. This week alone, prices shot up by $115 dollars. In the fall, they were as low as $325 a ton. A StoneX fertilizer expert says that it is all a perfect storm, starting with the runup in commodity prices. That means more inputs were applied last fall, which emptied out the system. As grain prices rocketed, demand shot up again.Then there was the February storm which caused nitrogen plants to shut down.More,GoodTrade,,0,0

TRENDINGMARKET NEWSSTOCK IDEASDIVIDENDSINVESTING STRATEGYREITSWALL STREET BREAKFASTON THE MOVEDIVIDEND NEWSMARKET OUTLOOKCourage &amp; Conviction InvestingCourage &amp; Conviction InvestingLong ideasBasic materialsCVR Partners, LP: My Best Current Commodity IdeaMar. 14, 2021 3:52 PMCVR Partners, LP (UAN)SummaryGiven $5 trillion of U.S. stimulus bills signed into law, many investors are looking for stocks to protect them against inflation. Pedestrian stuff about lithium, copper, oil, and gold abound.In today's piece, I discuss the compelling cycle, super cycle even, in the fertilizer market. This explains demand and supply aspects that make it compelling.CVR Partners, LP is the most torqued way to play rising ammonia and UAN prices (think the key inputs for nitrogen fertilizers).(This article was originally written in two parts on February 25, 2021 and March 7th on my Marketplace service).With the third massive stimulus bill recently signed into law, the U.S. government has spent (or committed to spending) north of $5 trillion in less than a one-year time period. In today's inflation-adjusted dollars, the total World War II expenditures were north of $4 trillion but shy of $5 trillion. $5 trillion makes Hank Paulson's talk of elephant guns during the 2008/2009 financial crisis look like bringing a knife to a gunfight. This is a breathtaking amount of money in such a short period of time, and inflation is inevitable. Some economists might even argue that the economy was already proving quite resilient, green shoots were emerging (to quote Ben Bernanke's famous phrase on 60 Minutes) and signs of inflation are/were already visible prior to this third round. There is no doubt in my mind this third round of money printing, another $1.9 trillion, is a tidal wave that most certainly will spark inflation.In today's piece, I decided to share my best current commodity stock ideas. To jog your memory, the last time I wrote about commodity stocks, at least on SA's free site, was when I wrote up Antero Resources (AR) at $1 (back on April 7, 2020) and Range Resources (NYSE:RRC) under $3 (back on April 5, 2020). Today's idea is compelling, but it won't go up to 10x like Antero Resources or 3X like Range Resources.Also, to spare you the suspense, this isn't about a company that mines, drills, or manufactures lithium, copper, oil, gold, or steel. Those commodities are way too mainstream and frankly way too pedestrian. I don't do pedestrian and love to fly under the radar. So if you were expecting the 50th article about Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) or another bullish article about the lithium stocks like Lithium Americas Corp. (OTC:LAC), Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE:SQM), or Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB), sorry in advance to disappoint.That said, before we dive in, let me be clear, I think this idea is compelling and has a good shot at 30% to 75% upside from its Friday, March 12, 2021 closing price of $29.79. However, whenever you are playing in the commodities sandbox, there are no guarantees.On Farm: The Economics And The SetupBefore we discuss CVR, Partners, LP, I want to explain the basics of the fertilizer market and then explain why we have a super cycle and such a unique setup.In the interest of full disclosure, I had to do a lot of synthesizing and work to piece together the puzzle pieces as there is very limited coverage of fertilizer stocks. A name like Deere &amp; Company (DE) seems to garner most of the attention when it comes to farming, at least in the mainstream media.After reading CF Industries, Inc. (NYSE:CF) and Nutrien Ltd.'s (NYSE:NTR) recent conference calls along with a good article about CF Industries by SA author Dave Hickling, along with various other articles, the disparate puzzle pieces started to look like a completed puzzle.Let me try my best to explain why I am super, super excited about 2021 setup for the fertilizer names.Exhibit A - Basic BackgroundFirst, enclosed below is an excerpt from Dave Hickling's recent article about CF Industries. His article contains from good background information for anyone that needs to get up to speed.The main fertilizer products supply Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium and Sulfur that are required by growing crops. S is important, especially for certain oilseed crops, but it is often supplied in a sulfate form with the other three and discussion of the S fertilizer market is complicated. N, P and K are the big ones and global use of these three fertilizer nutrients is approximately 190 million tonnes. N comprises about 107 million tonnes (56%), P comprises about 46 million tonnes (24%) and K comprises about 37 million tonnes (20%). Note that these amounts are standardized to the supply of pure nutrients. The actual commercial single nutrient fertilizer products are not pure nutrient and rather contain between 28% and 92% of N, between 20% and 50% of phosphate and between 33% andMore,GoodTrade,,0,0

As a result, each holder of our common units may be required to sell such holder’s common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on investment, and may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of its common units. Our general partner is not obligated to obtain a fairness opinion regarding the value of the common units to be repurchased by it upon exercise of the call right. There is no restriction in our partnership agreement that prevents our general partner from issuing additional common units and then exercising its call right.

last year,CORNPhosphate Prices Hit Highest Level Since 2012, As Nitrogen Prices Also ClimbNitrogen Prices Increase 030221By TYNE MORGAN March 2, 2021Fertilizer prices continue to climb, as higher demand and strained supplies are creating issues. According to Rabobank's latest RaboResearch North America Agribusiness Review,  phosphate prices are now at the highest levels in North America since 2012. The report also shows urea is likely to see further price movement, as higher corn prices improve appetite for demand are key drivers of the market.raboThe sticker shock is also happening with nitrogen. Ken Ferrie, Farm Journal Field Agronomist and owner of Crop-Tech Consulting, Heyworth, Ill., says nitrogen prices were already moving higher, but the Texas freeze didn't help, putting a strain on production. “The nitrogen market is also climbing and seems to be climbing on a weekly basis,” says Ferrie. “Some of that is probably tied to corn prices as well, but you hear more due to the recent cold snap. They had to reroute some of this natural gas to heating instead of making nitrogen, so some of the facilities have been slowed down or shut down. That’s especially the case in the Texas situation where they had to move to heating. So, it's putting pressure on that market."With issues sourcing fertilizer in some places, industry experts predict the higher fertilizer prices to last through spring. Rabo's February report also stated price and supply concerns. "Looking further ahead, some buying opportunities may emerge as we look into the 2022 season for other inputs, as well. The potential risk for seed price increases headed into the 2022 planting season should be considered.

Insurance Guarantees Highest in YearsSpring Crop Insurance Guarantees Set at $4.58 for Corn, $11.87 for Soybeans2/26/2021 | 4:47 PM CSTKatie Micik DehlingerBy  , Farm Business EditorSpring crop insurance guarantees are calculated by averaging the daily close of the December corn and November soybean contracts throughout February. For 2021, those worked out to $4.58 per bushel of corn and $11.87 per bushel of soybeans. (DTN file photo)MT. JULIET, Tenn. (DTN) -- Spring crop insurance guarantees for corn and soybeans will be $4.58 and $11.87 per bushel, respectively, increases of $0.70 and $2.70 from last year.For corn, it's the highest spring guarantee since 2014; it's the highest since 2013 for soybeans.The guarantees are an integral part of revenue protection crop insurance policies. While farmers have several types of federally subsidized crop insurance to choose from, revenue protection is the most popular. The spring guaranteed prices are calculated by averaging the daily close of the December corn and November soybean contracts throughout February. They're then combined with the farm's historical yield average to calculate a level of insurable revenue. Farmers can elect to cover up to 85%, with most farmers choosing to purchase 75%, 80% or 85%, depending on what the premiums are in their area.Higher guarantees, like this year, mean farmers will have better protection if prices or yields dropped sharply. If a farmer purchases 85% coverage on corn, that equates to a price of $3.89 per bushel, at or above many farmers' break-even levels."I think, No. 1, is that it helps farmers relax a little bit knowing that they've got pretty good downside protection there and can still come out OK if, for some reason, prices did fall apart and go lower," DTN Lead Analyst Todd Hultman said.More,GoodTrade,,0,0
last year,Google ammonia (one of UAN's products) Ammonia will be the fuel of choice for world shipping, thus increasing ammonia demand /price globally. Ammonia will not be shipped up the Mississippi to farmers in corn belt. CVR must increase production to meet demands in their region. MPA joins industry in Ammonia Fuelled Tanker Joint Development Projectin Port News 25/02/2021Ammonia-fuelled tanker Joint Development Project (JDP) partners – MISC Berhad (MISC), Lloyd’s Register (LR), Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI) and MAN Energy Solutions (MAN) announced the entry of two new partners – the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) and Yara International ASA (Yara) at a recent webinar focused on Ammonia as a Shipping Fuel which was organized by the Getting to Zero Coalition’s Fuels &amp; Technologies workstream. The JDP partners also went on to announce a name for the expanded coalition – The Castor Initiative.Leading fertilizer company – Yara will work alongside MISC, LR, SHI and MAN to develop ammonia propulsion ships to support the maritime industry’s drive to decarbonisation.In addition, the consortium will be able to tap onto MPA’s experience as a bunkering hub and flag state to gather insights on safety issues and ammonia bunkering procedures, and gain access to research capabilities in Singapore.The addition of MPA and Yara means that the alliance which was first unveiled in January 2020, now has a complete representation from all areas of the maritime ecosystem. The experience and expertise of each partner will be central to the success of the initiative, from conception to project realisation.This announcement follows a key project milestone in September 2020 when LR awarded Approval in Principle to SHI for its ammonia-fuelled tanker design with the aim of commercialising these developments by 2024.To meet the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) 2050 ambitions on halving greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 2008 levels, zero-carbon vessels need to enter the world fleet by 2030. The JDP was motivated by the partners’ shared belief that the maritime industry needs leadership and greater collaboration if shipping is to meet the IMO’s GHG ambitions.While ammonia is one of the fuels being considered by maritime stakeholders, the partners also recognise that the shipping industry will need to explore multiple decarbonisation pathways and hope their collaboration will spur others in the maritime industry to join forces on addressing this global challenge.Quotes by JDP PartnersMaritime and Port Authority of SingaporeMPA Chief Executive, Ms Quah Ley Hoon, said, “Decarbonisation remains a key priority for the maritime sector, not just in Singapore but globally. As a transshipment and bunkering hub, we are committed to meet IMO2030/2050 decarbonisation goals. We are also looking forward to collaborating with like-minded industry partners to support the development and trials of alternative future marine fuels such as ammonia.”Yara International ASA“Supporting the enabling role of ammonia in the energy transition, we recognize the need for value chain collaboration to make zero emission shipping by using ammonia as a fuel a reality,” said Magnus Ankarstrand, EVP Clean Ammonia, Yara.MISC BerhadMISC President and Group CEO, Yee Yang Chien said, “We are honoured to have MPA and Yara join us as partners on this journey to develop deep sea zero carbon vessels. This JDP has come a long way since our inception in January 2020 and it now stands complete as Castor Initiative; with absolute collaboration and commitment from principal key stakeholders in the shipping industry. We are certainly excited with the expansion of the alliance and look forward to unlocking new possibilities to accomplish our GHG aspirations ahead of 2050 together with MPA and Yara, both of which are global leaders in their respective areas of authority and expertise.”Lloyd’s RegisterLR Group CEO Nick Brown said, “Making deep-sea zero-carbon vessels a reality within this decade calls for leadership commitment and collaborative action. Lloyd’s Register welcomes the expertise that the MPA and Yara will bring to the ammonia-fuelled tanker joint development project (JDP). The calibre of the partners involved in this JDP as well as the milestones agreed are testament to the maritime industry’s determination to deliver on the IMO’s 2050 GHG ambitions.”Samsung Heavy IndustriesSHI President and CEO Jin Taek Jung said, “In the course of energy transition, joining this JDP towards developing zero-carbon vessels coincides with our endeavor to find sustainable growth momentum and fulfill our social responsibility for clean environment. The long-term journey to realize zero-carbon and ultimately zero-emission vessels requires extensive cooperation of the stakeholders in the maritime industry.

(DTN photo by Pamela Smith)ANKENY, Iowa (DTN) -- Farmers may want to lock in fertilizer supplies and prices soon for the 2021 crop if they haven't done so, according to Josh Linville, director of fertilizer for StoneX (formerly INTL FC Stone).The fertilizer and risk management analyst said a "perfect storm" of factors have contributed to tight crop nutrient supplies and a surge in prices. Fundamentals indicate neither will ease by the time fieldwork begins across much of the country this spring.Linville said macronutrients are at the top of his supply concerns. This includes various types of nitrogen, potash and phosphate products such as MAP and DAP."I won't say farmers won't be able to find products, but it could be at a (high) price. This is a capitalistic system," Linville said."Farmers need to have a conversation with their fertilizer supplier now about their needs," he continued. "The longer they wait, the more pressure it puts on the supply system and the more you have to rely on just-in-time demand."StoneX is a global financial services and consulting company. The fertilizer division assists companies with sales and procurement strategies.FERTILIZER PRICESRetail fertilizer prices have skyrocketed since last fall, according to retailers regularly surveyed by DTN. The average price for DAP, for example, is now at an eight-year high at $600 per ton.A significant price surge, which DTN designates #$%$ or more, occurred in each of the past three weeks for all eight of the fertilizers DTN tracks. The following are average fertilizer prices per ton and percent increases compared to last month as of Feb. 24:?DAP, $600, 22%.?Urea, $457, 18%.?MAP, $648, 15%.?UAN32, $288, 15%.?UAN28, $245, 14%.?Anhydrous, $530, 10%.?Starter, 10-34-0, $522, 9%.More Recommended for You?Potash, $404, 7%.Read the latest DTN fertilizer price trend story here: Reid Thompson, who farms 3,400 acres of corn and soybeans with family near Colfax, Illinois, tracks fertilizer prices and trends with the goal of purchasing inputs at the best time to minimize expenses.Thompson purchased all the UAN28 he'll use for the 2021 corn crop last August for a little less than $150 per ton. That's about $100 less than current prices.But he still has about 50 to 100 tons of dry fertilizer to buy for the 2021 crop. Thompson expects to pay about $100 to $150 per ton more for this spring for MAP and DAP, compared to what he paid to lock in 90% of the farm's needs in December. Soil test results weren't in on some ground to buy all of the requirements.Thompson has 120,000 gallons of liquid fertilizer storage on the farm, which is 110% of annual needs. He doesn't have on-farm dry fertilizer storage."Fortunately, we bought nitrogen at the cheapest level it had been in three to four years," Thompson said. "I guess I should have written a bigger check in December (for dry fertilizer and estimated needs). Coincidently, fertilizer prices follow suit with grain prices."COMMODITY PRICESLinville and Jim Fettkether, a farmer and fertilizer retailer near Dunkerton, Iowa, said Thompson's price observation, by-in-large, is correct. Both commodity and fertilizer values started to march upward in August.In the last eight months, March futures prices have increased more than $2 per bushel for corn, $5 per bushel for soybeans, $1.20 per bushel for wheat and 25 cents per pound for cotton.The August derecho, a vicious windstorm that destroyed millions of acres of crops across in Iowa and other Midwest states, sparked a commodity price rally, according to Linville. Strong domestic and international demand for grain and cotton contributed to the rally, as well and will likely help sustain it in the near term.Government COVID-19 relief and market facilitation payments also provided farmers more money to spend on the 2021 crop, Linville said."That will jumpstart the fertilizer market pretty quick," he continued."Anytime you put $5 in front of corn, you know the fertilizer industry is watching," Fettkether added. "Everyone (crop input companies, landlords, etc.) wants a piece of the pie."SUPPLY AND DEMANDStrong fall fertilizer demand contributed to fertilizer higher prices and possible supply issues, Linville said. He credits prospects of a profitable 2021 for grain producers and a near-perfect fall for application."There will be significant tightness on some products, namely MAP and DAP," Linville said. "We emptied the system and there's been disruption with imports. The period from the end of fall to the spring isn't that long to replenish supplies."The U.S Department of Commerce slapped duties on phosphate fertilizer imports from Russia aMore,GoodTrade,,4,1

Fertilizer companies reported issues maintaining production last week.Nitrogen fertilizer manufacturer CF Industries reported its Oklahoma plants were most affected by the cold weather last week, according to a Dow Jones report last Thursday. This could likely lead to tightening supplies of nitrogen fertilizer in the coming weeks and months, totaling hundreds of thousands of tons of nitrogen fertilizer."The tightening of North American supply could be noticeable," CF Industries CEO Tony Will said.CF was not the only fertilizer company seeing fertilizer production suffer last week because of the cold weather. Dow Jones reported last Thursday as well that Mosaic may have had to shut down a Louisiana fertilizer plant for a few days due to issues with freezing.Mosaic CEO Joc O'Rourke said in addition to the Louisiana plant issues, the company has also seen the movement and unloading of the company's ships in the Gulf of Mexico affected by the cold conditions. The company is well equipped to deal with extreme weather events, compared to the slowdowns forced by annual hurricanes in the Gulf region, O'Rourke said.With retail fertilizer prices moving higher over recent months, all fertilizers are now higher in price from a year ago.Both UAN28 and UAN32 are now 4% more expensive, both potash and anhydrous are 8% higher, 10-34-0 is 13% more expensive, urea is 27% higher, DAP is 46% more expensive and MAP is 49% higher compared to last year.DTN collects roughly 1,700 retail fertilizer bids from 310 retailer locations weekly.

last year,By Logan Garcia, Market Reporter - Fertecon, Agribusiness Intelligence, IHS MarkitThe following is a breakdown of wholesale prices and trends of the various fertilizers in January and first two weeks of February 2021.AMMONIADomestic:Following a trend in the second half of 2020, U.S. anhydrous ammonia prices continued to rise in January as supplies remain tight. Recovery for industrial ammonia consumption continues as chemical production adapts to COVID-19 challenges that contributed to restricting available volumes for agricultural use, as well plant outages and turnaround around the globe. OCI Beaumont, for example, will be down for scheduled maintenance for approximately two weeks from the last week of January.A higher Tampa settlement for February reflects strong fundamentals on most nitrogen sources in the U.S. following urea's early year rally, steadily rising UAN values and incremental increases in agricultural ammonia prices. Illinois spring ammonia prices rose to $460 per short ton (t) by the end of January from earlier offers at $425-$430 after the higher Tampa announcement. Meanwhile, markets in the Eastern Corn Belt pulled offers from $415-$430/t and did not reoffer at higher values until the following week.Plant prices ex-factory in Oklahoma before the higher Tampa settlement were at $275-$285/t prompt and $320-$325 for spring pull. while spring prices at Port Neal, Iowa, were reported at $415/t in mid-January. Prices at both plants reflect a $15-$25/t increase from initial prepay offers in December.Many plants and markets had actually pulled their pricing at the same time, and some waited up to several days to reoffer, as a major jump in the urea and phosphate prices brought further chaos to the fertilizer market at the end of January.In the short term, overall, we expect U.S. ammonia prices to stay firm given strong global fundamentals, including higher seasonal feedstock costs in natural gas and continued supportive demand.More,GoodTrade,,0,0

last year,Good read In the Tuesday, Feb. 9, World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report, commodity traders will mainly be watching for USDA's new estimates of U.S. corn and soybean ending stocks, but South American crop estimates will also be of interest.Below is a more in-depth look at what we're expecting on Tuesday.CORNJust two weeks ago, USDA announced 230 million bushels (mb) of corn export sales to China, and the CEO of Archer Daniels Midland mentioned China purchased 200 million gallons of U.S. ethanol for the first half of 2021. Add in a few other recent corn sales, and the demand outlook for corn has taken another big step forward since last month's WASDE report.Dow Jones' pre-report survey of analysts expects USDA to lower its estimate of U.S. ending corn stocks from 1.552 billion bushels (bb) to 1.363 bb or roughly 9% of annual use. There is room for the estimate to go lower as U.S. corn export commitments currently stand at 2.31 bb or 91% of USDA's 2.55 bb export estimate.Since Sept. 1, U.S. ethanol production has averaged 943,800 barrels per day, which is on pace for 5.167 bb of corn use if that holds in 2020-21. With corn prices above $5, some slowdown in ethanol production is likely, but USDA's current estimate of 4.950 bb looks 100 mb too low.USDA's estimate of world ending corn stocks remains overinflated with 7.55 bb marked for China. Just recently, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) lowered its estimate of China's corn surplus to 5.24 bb, based on China's active import purchases and high domestic prices. Without a credible inventory report, even FAO's estimate is just a shot in the dark and is probably still too high. One of these days, USDA might lower its own guess.More,richard,,3,0

Planned to do it in 2020 but the pandemic caused problems, UAN is now waiting for stabilization in rates and the debt can be called with no premium in June 2021, with hopefully an improved debt service profile.  The debt profile is what determines whether or not they can pay a distribution.  How often does East Dubuque undergo a planned turnaround?  Typically turnarounds occur each year, alternating between the two plants.  Turnarounds take 6-10 weeks and include a month of downtime.  Due to the pandemic there were no turnarounds in 2021, and turnarounds should resume at Coffeyville in 2021 and East Dubuque in 2022.  The company tries to build inventory in advance of a turnaround so there is no affect on EBITDA in the quarter.  Do you expect UAN pricing to improve in 2021?  We have already begun to see prices improve.  Forward contacts are around $20 / ton above current prices.More,Geezer31,,6,0

last year,So i just did some quick research on my reverse split stocks.  Of the three that I still hold, one(ONVO) hit a low after one month post reverse.  The other two (ACB &amp; RAD) hit their post reverse lows, five and four months after, respectively. I'm going out on a limb to say UAN will not hit its low until after 1 month (barring any tax loss selling) and will more than likely hit it before the first report of 2021.  If that report sucks and the outlook is poor, it will hit another low after that.  This is just My Opinion from the actual events that have happened to me.  So, don't be too quick to buy after the reverse goes though.Watch out for Tax Loss selling. I will look to add in the $4. and under range but after 2021.GLTA.

Reduced acreage in the years following depleted China’s state corn reserves, which is especially problematic in 2020/21 as corn usage rates soar to just shy of 11 billion bushels – the highest level on record.￼SPONSORED CONTENTTips for 2021 budget planning2021: Budgeting is more important than everDrought conditions followed by typhoon damage in China’s northeastern corn belt this summer eroded yield prospects.

Vernon, Indiana remained within a range of $145 to $150/t FOB, flat since summer fill prices settled in July. On the East Coast, however, prices firmed higher to $145 to $150/mt CFR, up from $140 in August.The main price driver here, however, was increased freight costs — the market remains very slow for the season and sustained low prices have not encouraged many imports.Ammonia is expected to benefit from projected mild fall weather conditions which could impact UAN sales into the spring. However, UAN remains a favorable spread to urea in terms of value per unit of nitrogen, and any setbacks for ammonia application this fall could signal larger forward demand into 2021. In the short term, however, the outlook on UAN is flat on stale market fundamentals.https://agfax.com/2020/10/16/dtn-fertilizer-outlook-support-for-domestic-retail-prices-short-term/More,Brubeans,,2,0

March 2021 corn futures rose $0.0325/bushel to $4.1025.Quick harvest paces last week came screeching to a halt in northern U.S. states over the weekend as a rain-snow mix blanketed areas of Minnesota and Wisconsin still in the early phases of corn harvest. Today’s Crop Progress report will more closely reflect the dry harvest conditions in the Midwest and Plains earlier last week before the early winter storms settled in over the weekend. With 94% of the crop matured as of last week, the window for harvesting before more winter weather sets in and starts to erode yields. As of October 11, the U.S. corn harvest was 41% complete. As of last Sunday, harvest was 11% ahead of the five-year average. Paces in today’s report will likely continue to pull away from the five-year average, though corn conditions could erode due to the weekend’s snow in the north.

last year,MoodysCVR Partners, LP B2 corporate family rating reflects the company's small scale and limited operational and product diversity with only two facilities and concentration in nitrogen fertilizers. A fixed capital structure, heavy debt load and high interest expense combined with a lower capitalization constrain CVR's credit profile. Limited growth prospects, seasonality and exposure to adverse weather are additional constraining factors. The rating also reflects our expectations for weak credit metrics in 2020 due to lower nitrogen prices and uncertain demand growth in 2021. The rating benefits from the company's geographic footprint and access to the Cornbelt and Southern Plains, which allows it to capture inland premium for nitrogen fertilizers.

That would make the country the world’s largest importer.“The buying also helps meet commitments under the U.S. trade deal. Imports that have been mostly ordered by state-owned companies are sold at a discount to local prices to benefit animal-feed mills in the south, said Feng.The surge in shipments has sparked speculation that China could become chronically dependent on the world market for large supplies, as happened with soybeans, where it accounts for more than 60% of global imports.“Chinese buying has helped push Chicago corn futures to the highest level since March.”More,richard,,3,0

2 years ago,If you compare UAN stock's price action to other fertilizer stocks (CF and MOS), you'll see that UAN doesn't follow the companies' price pattern. The other fertilizer companies have recovered much of their covid-19 price drop. But UAN hasn't. Now, if you compare UAN to its general partner CVR Energy (CVI), you'll see that UAN does follow that price pattern. So, UAN is not following the fertilizer industry, but rather it's following the energy industry. The worst industry in the S&amp;P.But if actually do a price comparison of UAN's stock to CVI's stock since covid-19, you'll see it's performing even worst. IMHO, CVI is siphoning all the cash out of UAN by:1) charging very high interest rates on their loans2) paying exorbitant salaries to execs for a company this size3) overcharging for the petcoke feedstockPersonally, I think it's borderline criminal.

2 years ago,Corn prices going upFertilizer next?Corn prices moved noticeably higher Thursday on a wave of technical buying supported by export optimism and worries over damage caused by violent Midwestern storms earlier this week. September futures climbed 10.5 cents to $3.25, with December futures adding 11.25 cents to $3.3850.Corn basis bids were steady to narrowly mixed across the central U.S. Thursday, moving as much as 3 cents higher at an Iowa river terminal and as much as 2 cents lower at an Illinois ethanol plant today.Corn prices have seen significant support in the past two sessions, despite USDA’s very bullish yield prediction of 181.8 bushels per acre in yesterday’s WASDE report. “This was the most bullish price response from an August USDA report day since 2013,” notes Naomi Blohm. What happened? For starters, the deadly round of Midwestern storms earlier this week may have taken out between 200 million and 400 million bushels. Find out what else Blohm has been monitoring in the latest Ag Marketing IQ blog.This morning, private exporters reported to USDA the sale of 4.3 million bushels of corn for delivery to unknown destinations. Of the total, 1.2 million bushels is for delivery during the 2019/20 marketing year, which ends August 30, with the remainder for delivery in 2020/21.Corn export sales were muted in comparison, notching 14.8 million bushels in old crop sales plus another 21.8 million bushels in new crop sales for a total tally of 36.6 million bushels. That landed in middle of trade guesses, which ranged between 15.7 million and 55.1 million bushels. Cumulative totals for the 2019/20 marketing year are still well behind last year’s pace, with 1.576 billion bushels.Corn export shipments boosted 43% above the prior four-week average, with 52.5 million bushels. China was the No. 1 destination, accounting for nearly a third of the total at 15.6 million bushels.China continues to significantly draw down its older corn reserves, selling more than 157 million bushels on auction earlier today, which was 100% of the volume available for sale.More,richard,,2,1

China is trying to meet the first-phase target of a trade agreement even as tensions rise between the world's two largest economies.The USDA said that exporters sold 1.937 million metric tons of corn for delivery to China during the 2020-2021 marketing year beginning Sept. 1, the third-largest deal for the grain to any destination. This purchase tops the previous largest deal to China of 1.762 million tons earlier this month.The corn sale reported on Thursday was valued at around $325 million, based on new-crop prices in the U.S. China's American farm goods purchases amounted to about $6 billion through May - the latest data available - up 9.1% from the same period in 2019 and 31% below 2017's level, according to Reuters.The Phase 1 trade deal signed by China and United States in January suggests the total value of 2020 U.S. farm exports to China must reach a minimum of $36.5 billion. Although the recent massive purchases will place the nation closer to that ambitious target, "achieving the figure might be challenging," Jin Canrong, an expert on U.S. studies at the Renmin University of China, said in an interview with CBS News.Trade deals seem to be going on the right track despite the escalating tensions between Beijing and Washington. China on Thursday accused the U.S. of stoking a new Cold War ahead of its presidential election in November.

Wheat sales also held their own last week, but corn sales dialed in relatively disappointing results.Old crop soybean sales fell 45% below the prior four-week average, to 9.5 million bushels. However, the 2019/20 marketing year is quickly winding down, and new crop sales for 2020/21 jumped to an eye-opening 122.9 million bushels, leaving total sales last week at 132.4 million bushels.

2 years ago,Everyone please give your thoughts on the $10M buyback authorized.  Here are my quick thoughts.  The average volume is roughly 250K shares per day.  if we say the price averages $1.00 per share, that's $250K in trades per day.  $10M is 40+ trading days worth of volume.  Even if this were to be spread out over the rest of the year, next week is week 20.  So there are 32 weeks left in the year to buy.  If the buys were done evenly that is 312K shares bought back by the company every week.  That is over an entire day's worth of volume on the buy side every week for the rest of the year.  This sort of positive pressure on the stock has to be a huge positive.  Also, I believe that this is the first attempt by the company to raise their stock price to get back within the NYSE rules.  I think this is a much better solution than doing a reverse split.  Overall, yeah I would have loved a dividend, but I didnt expect one given the pricing that we knew was out there for UAN.  The fact that they were cash flow positive still and dont show any risk of bankruptcy and they are trying to prop up the price of the stock with an over 10% repurchase plan, I think all in all I am about as happy as I could have been with this report.  The real question is do I buy more stock or just hold what I have?  I hate how underwater I am, but this potentially could be a great chance to make it back up.

2 years ago,From progressive farmer articleSAVANNAH, Ga. (DTN) -- Global fertilizer demand is increasing, and this rising demand requires growth capacity in the industry. The need internationally for more fertilizer presents some major challenges as farmers attempt to feed a growing world population.Michel Prud'homme, retired from International Fertilizer Associate (IFA), gave the global nutrient supply outlook at the 2019 Fertilizer Outlook and Technology Conference held in Savannah, Georgia, in mid-November. While one would expect many positives with the industry growing, there are some potential issues in the world fertilizer supply.DEMAND RISINGBecause of increasing international demand for nutrients, world fertilizer capacity will have grown by 66% between 1990 and 2022, he said. Specifically, during that same period, nitrogen increases 56%, phosphoric acid is up 90% and potash rises 78%.Prud'homme said, from 2000 to 2017, nitrogen saw large increases in production from China, West Asia, and Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECA). Then, from 2015 to 2022, the world supply forecast is for significant reductions in Chinese production, which is being offset slightly by increased production in the U.S., Russia, Africa and India.Ammonia capacity relates to natural gas reserves, and the top five largest natural gas reserves (U.S., Russia, Iran, Qatar and Saudi Arabia) have 25% of the world anhydrous ammonia capacity. The U.S. is the new natural gas supplier with newer nitrogen fertilizer capacity.Other countries such as Africa, EECA and West Asia have potential growth for future nitrogen fertilizer capacity, he added.Global ammonia capacity is expected to increase from 220 million metric tons (mmt) in 2018 to 228 mmt by 2021, a 3% increase in the world ammonia supply, he said. China's production is forecast to decrease 6% to 62.3 mmt from 2018 to 2021, which would be only 28% of the world's capacity -- down from 30% in 2018.More,richard,,3,0

Corn acres are expected to increase, and 58% of nitrogen consumption in the U.S. is used in corn production, he said.U.S. nitrogen fertilizer consumption was 12.2 mmt in 2018, but fell to an estimated 11.9 mmt in 2019, he said. Nitrogen consumption is expected to rise to 12.2 mmt to 12.4 mmt in 2020.Longer term, nitrogen demand is expected to continue to grow in the coming years, Yao added.The ammonia demand in 2019 is expected to be 183 mmt and is forecast to be 197 mmt in 2023.Nitrogen consumption is expected to be driven by Latin America and South Asian countries, he said.Global demand of about 12 mmt and supply of 6 mmt from 2009 to 2014 led to increased nitrogen prices during this time, he said. Capacity addition in the U.S. at historical rates led to a global nitrogen demand of 10 mmt and supply of 15 mmt from 2014 to the 2019 forecast, which led to declining prices.Yao said the forecast for 2019 to 2023 is for global nitrogen demand of about 8 mmt and supply of about 6 mmt. This appears to be a fairly well-balanced market with slow capacity additions, relatively stable Chinese urea exports and historical demand growth outside of China.This appears to be a rapid tightening of global nitrogen supply and demand, he said.Russ Quinn can be reachedMore,richard,,4,0

Private exporters reported sales of 10.0 million bushels to be delivered in the current marketing year. An uptick in Chinese soybean demand in weekly export data released yesterday also contributed to this morning’s $0.0025 increase in May soybean futures to $8.395. May soyoil futures dipped $0.02/lb lower to $25.59. May soymeal prices rose $0.3/ton to $289.Spot basis bids for soybeans in the Midwest firmed marginally at a Cincinnati, Ohio elevator and ended yesterday slightly mixed on the Mississippi River.

He said that without action, the world could face "multiple famines of biblical proportions within a short few months."We are already facing "a perfect storm" due to wars like those in Syria and Yemen and more frequent natural disasters, among other factors, he said."It is critical we come together as one united global community to defeat this disease, and protect the most vulnerable nations and communities from its potentially devastating effects," Beasley told the U.N. Security Council.The World Food Program, which works to fight hunger worldwide, serves nearly 100 million people a day, including 30 million who depend on the organization to stay alive, according to Beasley. He said that every night, 821 million people go to bed hungry.135 million people are acutely food-insecure and facing crisis levels of hunger or worse, according to a report published this week called the 2020 Global Report on Food Crisis. Now, the coronavirus could push an additional 130 million people "to the brink of starvation" by the end of the year, said Beasley."In a worst-case scenario, we could be looking at famine in about three dozen countries, and in fact, in 10 of these countries we already have more than one million people per country who are on the verge of starvation," Beasley said.More,richard,,4,0

2 years ago,North American LogisticsLooking ahead to spring, we continue to anticipate strong corn plantings in the U.S. The current soybean-to-corn futures ratio supports higher U.S. corn plantings in 2020 and is comparable to last year’s ratio at this time. The stocks-to-use ratio is an important metric to determine demand for agriculture commodities and forecast the next year’s acreage. With the lowest corn stocks-to-use ratio (11.5%) since 2013, CF Industries expects an increase in planted corn acres in 2020.While this will support good nitrogen fertilizer demand in 2020, the concern we hear the most is about the logistics of moving fertilizer to retailers and end users.The past two spring application seasons have seen the transportation and distribution system strained due to weather. In 2018 a short application season stressed the fertilizer supply chain as more tons were moved in a smaller window than expected. In 2019 historic flooding disrupted barge traffic and even rail transportation in some parts of the U.S. In some instances, this resulted in product unable to move from ports to farms in time.Companies like CF Industries pre-position as much product as possible at our distribution terminals so we are ready when demand appears. Our advice to purchasers of our product is to plan ahead as much as possible and talk to your retailer to cover at least a portion of your fertilizer position in advance. We hope, like you undoubtedly do, that the weather is much more favorable this year for transportation and applications. As we’ve seen, unfortunately, there are always challenges to be overcome, both expected — such as 2020 being the first application season without the Magellan ammonia pipeline that supplied many ammonia terminals in the western corn belt — and unexpected.More,richard,,4,0

Corn sales spiked 41% above the prior four-week average to notch a new marketing-year high. Grain prices all trended moderately higher immediately following the report’s release this morning.Corn exports climbed 72% above last week’s tally to reach 72.8 million bushels in old crop sales plus another 4.6 million bushels in new crop sales.

2 years ago,Good readApril 9, 2020By Russ Quinn, DTN Staff ReporterShareTweetShareEmailRetail fertilizer prices were mostly higher in the first week of April 2020, according to prices tracked by DTN. However, prices remain in a familiar range from slightly lower to slighty higher.Six fertilizers were higher in price compared to last month with none of the six up a significant amount, which DTN considers a price move of 5% or more. Urea had a $14/ton price increase compared to the same time last month, the largest jump of the eight major fertilizers tracked by DTN. Its average price was $383/ton.￼￼Potash has an average price of $370/ton, up $1; 10-34-0 $467/ton, up $1; anhydrous $492/ton, up $2; UAN28 $235/ton, up fractionally; and UAN32 $278/ton, up $1.The remaining two fertilizers had lower prices compared to a month earlier. Just like the higher priced fertilizer, these fertilizers did not have any large price movement. DAP had an average price of $408/ton, up $1, while MAP was $432/ton, down fractionally.On a price per pound of nitrogen basis, the average urea price was at $0.42/lb.N, anhydrous $0.30/lb.N, UAN28 $0.42/lb.N and UAN32 $0.43/lb.N.Despite the recent COVID-19 news and the rapid downward movement in agricultural commodity markets, there are some positive signs in the fertilizer industry. Dow Jones reported last week Harvest Minerals Ltd. said it expects fertilizer demand to increase in 2020.The South American fertilizer producer forecasted demand to rise about 3% this year. The move comes as Brazilian producers benefit from a weaker local currency, which also makes it more expensive to import fertilizers from abroad.The company said orders at the end of January more than doubled compared to the previous year. To date, most of the COVID-19 cases in Brazil are in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, with no cases reported near the firm’s Arapua manufacturing site, according to Harvest Minerals.More,richard,,1,0

2 years ago,Here's a question that perhaps someone super knowledgeable can answer.  I made a model for UAN's quarterly results from 2017 to present.  The good news is that the gate price of UAN has risen from $160m per ton in 2017 to $200 per ton in 2019, and ammonia has risen from $280 to $340 over the same period.  When UAN is above $180 and ammonia above $320, distributions appear.  So anyways, here's the question.  Pet Coke is an input price the fertilizer production, and in 2016 the price of pet coke was about $15, and now it's about $38.

I think UAN's business should continue just fine regardless of the virus, we all gotta eat!  And UAN input costs decline as the price of natural gas declines.  So business should be fine.  UAN's debt is ~$670m of 9.25% notes due 2023.  So, there is no meaningful debt due for 4 years.  And the CEO of UAN bought stock in late Feb, so he must have though the current business trends were good at that time.  The main piece of information which we don't have access to is the sales price of fertilizer.  All else being equal with declining natural gas prices, we would expect the end price of fertilizer to decline.  However, fertilizer demand in 2020 is supposed to be above 2019 due to higher volumes of crop forecast to be planted.  So, why below a dollar?  I have no idea.  Here's hoping for a 20 cent distribution in Q1 and commentary along the lines of "we have no idea why the unit price is this low"......any distribution other than zero seems like it could double the unit price in a day.More,Geezer31,,2,2
