18 hours ago,it seems likely Q1 distribution will include a per share deduction of about $6.50 for the payment of the $65 M note - assuming the tax credit does NOT come thru in Q1, but does come through in Q2, then the Q2 distribution will benefit from max volume sales, plus no interest payment, plus perhaps tax credit. so Q2 is shaping up to be a really substantial distribution which will probably draw a lot of attention to UAN - looks like adding to my already outsized position after Q1 distribution makes a lot of sense.

2 days ago,Skyrocket Fertilizer Spending by StateNine States Spent More Than $1 Billion on Fertilizer in 20203/17/2022 | 5:00 AM CDTÔøºBy&nbsp; Katie Micik Dehlinger , Farm Business EditorAddThis Sharing ButtonsShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to EmailShare to MoreÔøºNine states spent more than $1 billion on fertilizer in 2020, according to USDA data. (DTN graphic)MT. JULIET, Tenn. (DTN) -- In 2020, corn growers with high-productivity ground in central Illinois spent about $143 per acre on fertilizer, according to crop budgets from the University of Illinois. Forecasts for 2022 climbed to $230 per acre.But actual expenditures could be higher. When the Farmdoc team made their estimates in December, they argued that many farmers booked their needs before anhydrous prices topped $1,000 per ton. They also estimated farmers would likely reduce application rates to control costs and factored in the chance prices could come down by planting season.But with drought in South America and the war in Ukraine pushing the National Corn Index, a measure of spot cash prices at grain elevators, to more than $7 per bushel and December corn futures to more than $6.25 per bushels, farmers will be motivated to grow as many bushels as possible.Global supply issues have also continued to push the price of fertilizers higher. According to DTN's weekly survey of fertilizer retailers, the average retail price of anhydrous ammonia for the second week of March 2022 was $1,490 per ton. Two years ago, farmers paid an average of $490 per ton. You can read more here: https://www.dtnpf.com/‚Ä¶.USDA collects survey data on how much money farmers spend on fertilizer each year, aggregated to the state level. USDA is currently surveying farmers on their 2021 expenses, so the most recent data available is for 2020. It found that U.S. farmers spent $24.4 billion on fertilizer, lime and soil conditioner, about $1.1 million more than the previous year.Given the state of current retail prices, it's fair to assume the amount farmers spend on fertilizer in 2022 will skyrocket. But, historically, the states that spend the most on fertilizer haven't changed very much. In fact, the five states that spend the most on fertilizer have been in the same order for the past five years.More,richard,,4,0

4 days ago,Canadia‚Äôs Nutrien Ltd. said Wednesday it would boost potash production by about one million metric tons in 2022 to a total of 15 million tons, with most of the additional volume coming in the second half of the year.That may not be nearly enough to meet demand. Sanctions on major producers means there could be a shortage. Second-ranked producer Russia may face sanctions due to its invasion of Ukraine, while third-ranked Belarus has already been cut off from global markets. That leaves Canada scrambling to supply agriculture powerhouses like Brazil, the biggest importer. The northern nation already supplies nearly all of the potash used in the U.S.‚ÄúNutrien‚Äôs move to add one million metric tons of capacity, while sorely needed by the market, does not come close to fixing the supply gap if both Russia and Belarus are sanctioned out of the global potash trade,‚Äù said Alexis Maxwell, an analyst for Bloomberg‚Äôs Green Markets.Russia and Belarus together supply about 42% of the $35 billion global potash trade, or some 24 million metric tons annually, Maxwell said.More,richard,,5,0

I asked this question before the earnings announcement, and the speculation was that they monetized the carbon credits. Well, they didn't. Did they take the money from the Q1 cash flow? If they did, doesn't that suggest there may not be a distribution for Q1, or maybe a modest one? It's not without precedence. They have, on occasion, skipped paying a distribution in the past. Could they skip paying a distribution for Q1, and what will that do to the unit price?,jj,,0,0

Russia accounts for 23% of ammonia production globally, as well as 14% of urea and 21% of potash production, suggesting that a fertilizer export ban would further exacerbate already sky high fertilizer prices.		However, the full statement from the Russian trade ministry said, "the ministry had to recommend Russian producers temporarily suspend export shipments of Russian fertilizers until carriers resume rhythmic work and provide guarantees that Russian fertilizer exports will be completed in full."		The market may not be willing to take the Ministry's word at face value; however, the comments come on the back of major shipping groups suspending operations to and from Russia.		Importantly, Russia had already banned ammonium nitrate exports in an announcement February 2nd, whereby trade was to be postponed until April 2022.		European energy prices have pushed commodity feedstock costs higher, lifting global prices across the commodity complex; US fertilizer producers like CVR Partners (NYSE:UAN), CF Industries (NYSE:CF) and Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) stand to benefit from comparatively cheap feedstock costs and high fertilizer prices.		Fertilizer markets remain extremely tight; however, there is a path forward for Russian exporters, when and if shippers are able to load Russian volumes, and if the Ministry's statement Friday proves factual.More,richard,,5,0

18 days ago,Been doing some more reading on UBIT of MLP's in IRA's.Thanks for your comments from my last post.So, here is what I think will generally happen with UBIT if UAN goes from 115 to 215 in a year and pays out $40 per share in distributions...(maybe a dream?)  I think the $100 per share capital gain would be mostly tax-freesince capital gains in IRA's are not taxable (except for depreciation recapture at sale whichshould not be significant if UAN sold in a year).Probably most of the $40 per share distribution from UAN (hypothetical) would be taxable. The depreciation recapture at the sale would result in ordinaryUBIT tax. This is why I am suggesting most of the $40 dividend would be UBI as some of the initial $40 distribution would be shielded from tax by depreciation, but would then be taxed as UBI at sale in a year as depreciation recapture.My point is, if an MLP increases significantly in price in a year, not all of the capital gains and distributions would be taxed at up to 37%. Just sharing this as some of this logic also applies to UAN tax dynamics held outsidean IRA. One advantage of having securities in an IRA is that both short-term and long-term "net" capital gains are not taxable (as noted by another person).More,Richard,,3,1

21 days ago,Back in 2010 to 2012 UAN was about 2/3rds the production capacity of what it is today (ie, it was smaller).  Today fertilizer prices are higher than they were in that earlier time period.  At that time, in 2012, UAN hit $280, and was regularly above $200.  So, since UAN today has larger production capacity and the thing that UAN sells today commands a higher price than it did in 2012, why is the UAN unit price only about half of what it was back then?  Lets face it, with Russia at war the price of ammonia and UAN IS NOT going down to 2019 levels any time soon.  The price of corn continues to rise, and that means farmers can pay the currently high prices for fertilizer and still make loads of money.  That means demand is strong, sales price is strong, profitability is strong, and UAN has larger production capacity than it did 10 years ago, so the unit price should be ABOVE the price it was ten years ago.  It's just logic.  Whatever, eventually the big time distributions coming our way will pull the price higher.More,Geezer31,,9,0

last month,CF said multiple times in their conference call that the fertilizer demand and high prices are expected to last for at least a few years, and perhaps longer.  They and others will want to increase capacity going forward if their long term forecasts are reasonably accurate, and (here's the kicker) the cost to purchase existing fertilizer plants in the US is lower than the cost to build new green field fertilizer manufacturing facilites.  That says to me they think the price to buy UAN and gain ownership of the two UAN manufacturing plants is lower than the cost of building two new plants, so ...... this was said NUMEROUS times in the call (without mention of UAN specifically, but UAN's valuation is transparent in the market due to small size (two plants) and publicly traded units), so I think it's safe to assume the UAN is a future acquisition target for the big fertilizer companies.  I have no idea what a takeover premium might be, but hopefully nothing happens until post-Q2 2022 distribution announcement, because I expect H1 distribution news will push UAN's unit price much higher than it's current $100.More,Geezer31,,7,0

last month,Fertilizer Prices Jump in North America on Race for SuppliesBy Elizabeth Elkin BloombergFebruary 4, 2022, 12:26 PM ESTNorth American fertilizer prices rose the most in almost five months this week as a global competition for supplies means farmers could still have a ways to go before seeing relief from high nutrient costs.The Green Markets North America Fertilizer Price Index jumped 11%, the most since the week ended Sept. 10. India, the world‚Äôs largest importer of the popular nitrogen fertilizer urea, is looking to buy product later than usual. That will increase competition for nitrogen in the first quarter of 2022, when the U.S. and Europe are looking to buy, said Alexis Maxwell, an analyst for Bloomberg‚Äôs Green Markets.‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs seasonally late urea tender firmed a market looking for direction,‚Äù she said by email. ‚ÄúPrices rose globally with the U.S. market up $90 per short ton on the news.‚ÄùUrea prices in New Orleans rose 10% this week, also the most since September.Crop nutrient prices have surged to records around the world following an energy crunch that curbed production in Europe, while supplies also face threats from export curbs and trade sanctions. Though prices in the U.S. have dipped off records, they remain high. That‚Äôs adding to costs for farmers and prompting some to curb fertilizer usage, threatening to curb crop yields and further raise global food prices that are near a record high.More,Do,,3,0

2 months ago,UAN good newsMOINES (DTN) -- Ethanol producers in Iowa are coming off one of the strongest quarters of production and profitability in history as demand in the latter part of 2021 was better than anticipated, even with higher corn prices.Typically, the winter months are slower, but ethanol prices have been higher to overcome strong corn prices. Ethanol producers were somewhat caught off-guard by the demand they saw for fuel toward the end of the year."As part of the ethanol industry right now, we're seeing a really attractive margin environment," said Mike Jerke, president and CEO of Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy near Council Bluffs, Iowa. "It's good, and in our business, if you can get through the winter months, the seasonality is such where you are just trying to hold things together, and quite frankly, we're doing much better than just holding things together right now."POSITIVE SIGNSMoving into the next quarter, signs remain positive."At the end of the day, we're a commodity business. The whole industry will respond to positive margins by producing more. That will also have the effect of bringing those margins back. It will be interesting to see as we move into spring and the driving season, the buildup and if we are able to maintain the momentum."Dave Sovereign, board president for Golden Grain LLC in Mason City, said margins currently remain good, but not quite what they were during the last four months of 2022."Historically, they are at record levels, or at least at the high side of the trends," Sovereign said.Sovereign and others said the ethanol industry also was able to benefit from some supply chain logistics. Slower train performance in some areas of the country led to higher demand needs for ethanol."That's adding to the demand right now," Sovereign said. He added the industry has rebounded dramatically from the pandemic in 2020. "Especially this fourth quarter. Nobody saw that coming. You couldn't have planned for that type of dynamic coming together. That quarter was the best in the history of Golden Grain," which began producing ethanol in 2004.More,richard,,5,0

This follows Commerce‚Äôs affirmative preliminary countervailing duty ("CVD") determinations for UAN from Russia and Trinidad, issued in November 2021."Commerce‚Äôs affirmative preliminary antidumping and countervailing duty determinations not only address unfair trade practices that have harmed the U.S. UAN industry and its workers, but also help ensure that this vital product remains readily available to U.S. farmers from reliable domestic suppliers," said Tony Will, president and chief executive officer, CF Industries Holdings, Inc. "We appreciate the thorough, fact-driven investigations conducted by Commerce professionals and their impartial application of U.S. law. We look forward to participating in the post-preliminary phase of these investigations."Commerce found that Russian UAN imports are dumped (i.e., sold at less than fair value) into the U.S. market at rates ranging from 9.15% to 127.19%, and that Trinidadian UAN imports are dumped at a rate of 63.08%. As a result of these determinations, Commerce will impose cash deposit requirements on imports of UAN from Russia and Trinidad, based on the preliminary rates of dumping. Additional CVD cash deposit requirements are already in place based on Commerce‚Äôs previous preliminary finding that Russian UAN imports are unfairly subsidized at rates ranging from 9.66% to 9.84%, and that Trinidadian UAN imports are unfairly subsidized at a rate of 1.83%.More,richard,,7,0
2 months ago,Breaking News yesterday - US Anti dumping investigation concludes both Russia and Trinidad companies guilty of dumping -    Trinidad and Tobago got 68% tax. They were 37% of US import and they are now out of the game.Russian companies which export 43% of total US import got 9-127%, each Russian company got a different tax (in addition to 9% tariff). I guess they can play it dirty  and have the company which got 9% tax to "buy" from all the other Russian companies which got higher taxes and export into the US and pay 9% (plus 9% tariff). So to summarize- T&amp;T are probably out of the game.Russia might play games but will have 18% total tax as minimum. obviously I don't think they can sell all via one company as it will be easy to spot.

CVR Partners, LP (NYSE:UAN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 5Like other industries, the agriculture sector has also been hit by supply shortages in the past few months. An increase in demand for corn has led to more corn being planted. This has led to an increase in demand for nitrogen fertilizers, a key product of CVR Partners, LP (NYSE:UAN). Corn crops that do not use nitrogen fertilizers have yields affected by as much as 40%. The prices of nitrogen fertilizer have thus more than doubled in the past few months, leading to greater revenues for firms like CVR Partners, LP (NYSE:UAN).The positive business momentum is also reflected in the share price of CVR Partners, LP (NYSE:UAN) that has climbed more than 390% in the past twelve months. With supply disruptions likely to persist in 2022, the stock has plenty of room to climb even higher.There has been increased hedge fund interest in CVR Partners, LP (NYSE:UAN) as well. At the end of the third quarter of 2021, 5 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $20 million in CVR Partners, LP (NYSE:UAN), up from 3 in the preceding quarter worth $18 million.Just like CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

(CRU graphic)Global nitrogen demand is expected to increase in 2022 despite higher prices. (CRU graphic)OMAHA (DTN) -- Despite significantly higher fertilizer prices across the globe throughout 2021, global nitrogen fertilizer demand appears to be set to increase in 2022. According to fertilizer analysts, demand destruction does not appear to be on the horizon.Nitrogen supplies continue to be tight with various supply issues, but the price of nutrients could begin to fall in the second half of the year as supply returns. The number of corn acres in the United States in 2022 could affect nitrogen supplies.GLOBAL N DEMAND TO INCREASE?According to the International Fertilizer Association (IFA) Public Summary Medium-Term Fertilizer Outlook 2021-2025 (https://www.fertilizer.org/‚Ä¶) released in August of 2021, global fertilizer use (N+P+K) was estimated at 198.2 million metric tons (mmt) in 2020-21, which was almost 10 mmt or 5.2% higher than in 2019-20. This was the largest increase since 2010-11.The rate of growth in all fertilizer demand is expected to slow to 0.9% in 2021-22. IFA forecasts global fertilizer use to reach 199.9 mmt.Nitrogen experienced a 4.1% increase in demand to 110 mmt in 2020-21. Annual growth in global fertilizer demand will be around 1% from 2021-22 to 2025-26.Global ammonia production increased by 2.9 mmt in 2020, taking total supply to 185 mmt. From 2015 to 2020, global ammonia capacity increased by 6 mmt.World urea demand is forecast to increase about 3% in 2022 to around 170 mmt, according to London-based consulting firm CRU. Chris Lawson, head of fertilizers for CRU, told DTN that demand destruction from higher nitrogen prices has been overstated.The various supply issues globally are well established in 2021, from increasing demand to the supply-chain issues.Lawson said nitrogen is a product that is fairly inelastic. While there are issues with supply causing prices to spike higher, farmers are still going to buy and apply the most important nutrient, he said."There are different ways of looking at demand destruction," Lawson said. "What might happen is North American farmers will get their nitrogen, but farmers in other parts of the world may be short some."More Recommended for YouKub's DenHigh Fertilizer Prices: The History and FuturePrices for dry urea fertilizer are 143% above year-ago levels, but only 13% above the previous all-time high from 2012.

Four questions can help producers decide how to adjust their fall fertilizer program, as they eye uncertain spring supplies. (DTN photo by Pamela Smith)10/26/2021 | 3:50 PM CDTHere are four questions that can help farmers adjust their fertilizer program, as prices soar...HIGH NATURAL GAS PRICESOne reason nitrogen prices climbed higher on the world market in 2021 is the situation with higher natural gas prices, specifically in Europe.Natural gas prices have risen globally as countries reopen their economies and lifted COVID-19 restrictions, and thus natural gas demand increased. Higher prices earlier this fall in Europe caused fertilizer manufacturers to curtail production with changing margins.CF Industries halted production at two United Kingdom nitrogen facilities in September because of the skyrocketing natural gas price. One plant reopened a week later, and the other plant reopened in October, thanks to a UK subsidiary deal.While some might believe fertilizer producers could be limiting production of nutrients to increase the price, Lawson said nitrogen fertilizer producers are producing as much product as they possibly can. Many manufacturers are even delaying maintenance to their facilities to continue to produce much-needed tons of nitrogen, he added.With production at full tilt, at some point, the supply will catch up with the demand and fertilizer prices will begin to level off. Lawson believes this could be seen by the second half of 2022.U.S. CORN ACRES MATTERWhat happens in North America, specifically the U.S., has a large effect on the global nitrogen fertilizer market.More,Ross,,0,0

Russia has put some export limits on fertilizers. China produces one-quarter of the fertilizers in the world, but now they are also importing. So the pressure on that sector is a different than we‚Äôve faced before.When is the last time that we saw the threat of famine or world hunger on a scale that we‚Äôre seeing today?This is worse than 2007-2008 for sure, in terms of what we call levels of acute food insecurity driven by conflict. But globally, the overall situation is still better than in those years ‚Äî in the sense that we still have food availability but the problem today is of food access. But it is entering a situation that I call an orange light, and potentially a red light if we‚Äôre not careful. ‚Ä¶ We don‚Äôt have a food crisis today.

4 months ago,UAN excellent newsAnhydrous prices surged 38% from October to November, and now averages $1,113/ton. The nitrogen fertilizer is 163% more expensive than at this time last year. (DTN chart)MT. JULIET, Tenn. (DTN) -- The average retail price of anhydrous set a record this week at $1,113/ton after increasing 38% from last month. The seven other major fertilizers tracked by DTN for the first week of November saw increases ranging from 9% to 36% as supply disruptions push prices to new highs. DTN considers a monthly price change of 5% or more to be significant.DTN began collecting fertilizer price bids in 2008 as expanding corn acreage pushed up demand for fertilizer, taking prices with it. DTN reported anhydrous' highest price during the first week of November that year, at $1,043/ton. And while the nitrogen fertilizer is the most expensive of the eight DTN monitors today, it wasn't back then. That honor went to 10-34-0, which cost $1,250/ton. MAP was close behind at $1,079/ton. This year, high prices are more related to supply chain issues and worries about shortages than increased demand. The entire fertilizer complex is seeing higher prices, but the largest movers this month are nitrogen products.The average price of UAN28 is 36% higher than last month at $545/ton. UAN32 is 32% more expensive at $604/ton, while urea is up 26% at $820/ton. All are new records for DTN's database.Potash and DAP prices are 11% higher than last month, at $750/ton and $814/ton, respectively. MAP costs an average of $900/ton, up 9%.Unlike 2008, 10-34-0 is the laggard. While it's up 10% from last month at $702/ton, it's only 54% higher on the year, far less than the price gains seen in other fertilizers. Anhydrous is now 163% more expensive than in the first week of November 2021. UAN28 is 162% higher. UAN32 costs 144% more. Urea, 129%. Farmers are paying 127% more for potash, 88% more for MAP and 82% more for DAP.More,richard,,9,0

4 months ago,From cf industry conference call We believe global supply will remain constrained in the near term, with relief unlikely to appear anytime soon. We believe inventory in the channel is very low. Global production has been lower in 2021 due to severe weather in North America, higher maintenance worldwide, and ongoing European shutdowns and curtailments. Further, the Russian and Chinese governments are discouraging nitrogen fertilizer exports through the spring. These factors suggest the potential for strong fertilizer demand to last beyond 2023 even as some regions are unable to secure enough product in this supply constrained environment, resulting in lower yields. If this were to happen, demand would be deferred into future years as it would take more than two growing seasons to replenish global grain and oilseed stocks. As we prepare for the spring application season, we continue to receive substantial interest for any product we offer into the marketplace. We are building a solid order book for the first quarter of 2022 at the prices you see in the market today. The demand side of the equation is still very strong. And you're correct, what we sold for fall and we're applying today was sold at levels much lower than the current market, which is probably over $1,000 for ammonia. That being said, we're selling $1,000 ammonia for fall application on our incremental tons that are available, where, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're selling urea. And there is significant demand at that $730, $750 a short ton NOLA. It's even higher in the interior at over $800, which we've transacted at Port Neal. And you've seen in the publications the UAN reaction and the demand pulling. And I just looked at the analysis of where we are to date with order books and demand, and again, in a very good place at $550 UAN, calculating all that forward with current trend yield at 177 bushels per acre on the trend yield, that's not considering the I states, where you'll be 200 to 275 bushels.More,Ross,,6,0

Q4 fertilizer pricing will not be close to current prices as the price jump really occurred in October, and much of Q4 production was already sold before the price increase began.  Their realized prices will really rocket higher in H1 2022.  They expect to have some firm options on monetizing the carbon credits by Q1 2022.  The CEO thinks the strong cycle may last for a while, although no one really knows the future.  The key thing to watch is corn and wheat prices, if they are high fertilizer prices are likely to remain high.  In general the call wasn't a rocket ship launch, but it did confirm the positive environment, and the likelihood of steadily improving results next Q and much much better results through next summer as the higher fertilizer prices appear in the financial statements.More,Geezer31,,5,0

5 months ago,I suppose I have to enter the distribution sweepstakes Disclaim:   I remain long, slight increase in position (held back by diversification limits) and expect an increased distribution over at least the next two quarters.Estimate:  $3.00-3.40, 3.25 most likely...could be larger and I'd be pleasantly surprised if we get a windfall but I tend to hold my cards very closely.I run more cautious than most everyone else here and I'll outline my reasoning:(1) Like most boards, I still see a considerable amount of projection / confirmation bias influencing estimates. (No, not -all- of you, just -some- of you).  Accentuate the positive and all that....(2) Yes, -spot- prices are still extremely strong, but we don't know for how long.  Neither does management(3) I've been busy and haven't mined the 10-K's -but-:  contract tends to be lower and we don't know how much forward sale for next season will be under contract and not spot.(4) Too may people focusing on gross selling price, forgetting that UAN, like everyone else, is caught up in a cost increase cycle for inputs, logistics. We'll still be up, but maybe not quite as much once this gets factored in and we don't know how long cost growth will continue (i.e. longer than selling price increase?).  Think net, not gross, please?And, again, still bullish, still expecting an increased distribution - just a more sustainable/managed one.(5) Same applies for their customers - who are being eaten alive by fuel, equipment and logistics costs. The past is already written but future buying may be more constrained than expected.  Look at the backwardation in corn after a good season. There are some estimates that a significant fraction of farmers may need a corn price -higher-than current (high 5's? - I've seen 5.80 suggested for smaller farmers but, no, I don't recall the source on that) just to break even. Consider that they may switch to beans.  Management may want to withhold a cash buffer to smooth out distribution flow, especially since we can expect the annual one punk quarter (see next)(6) No, they won't reverse the reserve for turnaround costs.  They may even increase it since they've been running flat out for longer.  They may/may not prioritize paydown of the debt stub(7) As noted last quarter, UAN/Rentech has -never- paid out more than 3-3.50 (adjusted) IIRC and it's an MLP, not a closed end vehicle or royalty vehicle...i.e. management is not obligated to disburse all distributable cash.

Europe has been hard hit by the natural gas crunch, which has forced a number of nitrogen-fertilizer plants to halt or curtail production, including the likes of Norway‚Äôs Yara International ASA and top European chemicals company BASF SE. The gas makes up 80% of the cost to produce the nutrients and prices are four to five times higher than normal, according to industry group Fertilizers Europe. Local farmers are already fretting about securing enough supplies for the spring. Any scarcity risks curbing grain yields and quality in the European Union, the world‚Äôs biggest wheat exporter and a major barley supplier. Any drops in output could add to concerns about rising food prices.Corn prices have been rebounding over $5.50 a bushel, well over the five-year average around $4.34. A benchmark North American fertilizer price index rose 0.4% to $1,017.87 per short ton Friday, still teetering close to a record reached earlier this month.Farmers in the U.S. have pulled back slightly on fall fertilizer use, and retailers are now only buying what they need for the immediate future, said Alexis Maxwell, an analyst at Green Markets, a business owned by Bloomberg. The rush to buy fertilizer for the spring won‚Äôt come until around February.‚ÄúSo now we wait and see,‚Äù Maxwell said. ‚ÄúDo rest of the world prices fall to meet the U.S., or does the U.S. eventually jump up to meet the rest of the world?‚ÄùRelated: Food Prices Poised to Surge With Fertilizer at Highest in Years(Updates with corn prices in paragraph five.)¬©2021 Bloomberg L.P.AdvertisementMore,GoodTrade,,3,0

5 months ago,ANKENY, Iowa (DTN) -- Fear regarding rising prices and limited supplies of nitrogen, along with a fast harvest, could entice producers to apply more anhydrous ammonia this fall than usual and before the soil is fit.Some anhydrous ammonia application has begun in fields where soil temperatures are still above 50 degrees Fahrenheit. That makes the popular corn nitrogen (N) fertilizer more vulnerable to leaching, which can reduce availability for next year's corn crop and pollute water sources.Nutrient specialists and agronomists understand why producers may want to buy and inject anhydrous ammonia as soon as possible, but they urge farmers to hold off applications until conditions are right or until spring."Please try to wait until soil temperatures are consistently below 50 and dropping and use a nitrification inhibitor," said Lowell Gentry, a University of Illinois agronomist and nitrogen and drainage tile researcher. "There might not be a big yield impact (not following either practice), but there can be a significant impact on water quality."Gentry called this fall the "perfect storm" for early anhydrous ammonia application -- and more of it. Here's why.-- Anhydrous price has nearly doubled to tripled within the past year, according to DTN fertilizer price data and farmers.More,richard,,4,0

5 months ago,DTN Retail Fertilizer TrendsMAP Fertilizer Price Hits $800 Per Ton as Retail Prices Spike10/6/2021 | 9:42 AM CDTRuss QuinnThese record or near-record high retail fertilizer prices could be present through next spring. This was the conclusion of a recent North Dakota State University (NDSU) news release ().Dave Franzen, NDSU Extension soil science specialist, said he expects fertilizer price to stay at these price levels or continue rising through next spring."China has supplied about a third of the world's phosphate and it has essentially banned exports through 2022," Franzen said. "That puts the burden of supply on other countries, including the United States." (For more, please read: )The U.S. is not in a great position to expand mines and production due to environmental concerns, he said. This means fertilizer prices will continue to rise at least through 2022.Franzen recommends farmers consider soil sampling, use nitrogen calculators and consider whether fall nitrogen applications are wise. With phosphorus fertilizer, he suggests producers be more efficient when applying the fertilizer by working it into the soil or even applying the nutrient with a drill or air-seeder to limit the effects of water or wind movement."The most important strategy to use for potassium in North Dakota is to follow the NDSU recommendations for potassium for each crop, soil test by zone and use the North Dakota potassium calculator for corn to avoid any excessive and futile potassium application," he said.Retail fertilizer prices compared to a year ago show all fertilizers have increased significantly.10-34-0 is now 40% more expensive, DAP is 64% higher, urea is 71% more expensive, MAP is 74% higher, UAN32 is 78% more expensive, UAN28 is 83% higher, anhydrous 84% is more expensive and potash is 92% higher compared to last year.More,L,,2,0

(NYSE: CF), a leading global manufacturer of hydrogen and nitrogen products, today announced that it has begun restarting its ammonia plants at the Donaldsonville Complex in Louisiana. Start-up of product upgrade plants (urea, nitric acid, urea ammonium nitrate) will follow.

6 months ago,CF went Force majeure suspending nitrogen deliveries on Sept 3 but it doesnt make the news until the 7th?We kind of suspected - but, still.(Bloomberg) -- Fertilizer prices are soaring after the world‚Äôs largest nitrogen facility had to declare a force majeure.CF Industries Holdings Inc. said on Sept. 3 that it can‚Äôt fill orders from its Donaldsonville, Louisiana, nitrogen complex, which was closed ahead of Hurricane Ida, according to a letter seen by Bloomberg. That‚Äôs stoking fears of production losses at a time when supplies are already tight.Fertilizer prices are already high, and that‚Äôs adding to increasing costs for farmers, who are paying more for everything from land and seeds to equipment. The higher costs of production may mean more food inflation is on the way. Global fertilizer costs touched near-decade highs in recent weeks, becoming expensive enough where growers may have to curb purchases.Prices for urea, a type of nitrogen fertilizer, in New Orleans are spiking in part due to ‚Äúuncertainty surrounding the restart of CF‚Äôs Donaldsonville plant,‚Äù as well as when other plants will receive electricity, Scotiabank analyst Ben Isaacson said in a note Tuesday.The giant Donaldsonville complex consists of 19 plants including six ammonia and five urea facilities, making nitrogen-based products for agricultural and industrial markets. The plant is located in Ascension Parish, where over 2,700 customers were still out of power as of Tuesday morning, and should have power restored later in the day, according to an update from Entergy Corp.CF Industries did not respond to a request for an update of the status of the plant Tuesday. Ark Veterinary Clinic, just down the street from the complex, said it didn‚Äôt yet have power back.More,Do,,4,0

7 months ago,MOS issued a press release today indicating hurricane Ida caused meaningful damage to their New Orleans based production facilities. I think CF has major UAN fertilizer manufacturing facilities in the same general area. UAN the MLP does not have impaired manufacturing in New Orleans. So I guess in the coming days we watch for similar news out of CF letting us know how storm Ida affected their UAN fertilizer manufacturing plants in New Orleans. If CF‚Äôs UAN manufacturing is also going to be down for1 to 2 months, and we head into the high  demand season for 2022 planting, and corn prices stay elevated, well, the price of UAN fertilizer has to go higher, and perhaps A LOT higher.

7 months ago,Yes, fertilizer prices today are high.  Will they stay high?  That's the thousand dollar question.  We know that if UAN fertilizer stays above $300/ton, UAN the MLP is going to distribute around $20 per year, give or take.  This is clear.  However, if UAN fertilizer falls back to $150/ton, then UAN the MLP probably heads back toward zero distribution.  So it's the future price of fertilizer that is the issue now, as far as I can tell the price of fertilizer is still heading higher, and by November we'll be heading into buying for the 2022 spring planting season, and that seasonal period generally pushes prices higher.  So, I guess we UAN MLP unit owners just have to sit here and collect our ~$5.00 per quarter distributions until the rest of the world comes to realize what a cash machine we are sitting on here.......More,Geezer31,,3,0

7 months ago,Small update in the middle of Q3.  UAN prices are above $320/ton for Q4 and beyond.  Ammonia prices are less transparent, but my guess would be they are above $600/ton.  The tariffs are moving forward, so it's unlikely Russian or Trinidad/Tobago UAN will be shipped into US markets going forward, and that should push prices higher.  The completed debt refinance will have $4 million per quarter interest expense savings going forward.  The news looks great.  In this type of environment it's easy to see UAN paying $15 per year, or perhaps more, up to even $25 per year is possible.  The rest of the world will know this by summer 2022.  I think the units are highly undervalued, and if UAN prices climb from Q4 on (as they normally do) the unit price is insanely low.  This is one of those investment holdings where I'm happy to just own it and hope that time passes more quickly, because I want the positive newsflow to come out.More,Geezer31,,3,1

I will take it by word of a manager of a fertilizer services store not too terribly far from one of the plants.The retail fertilizer market and its iffy supply channel is making fertilizer retailers nervous as fall rapidly approaches. Bob Spratt, manager of LeRoy Fertilizer Services located in LeRoy, Illinois, told DTN a storm could be brewing with a possible limited supply of crop nutrients."I have not seen a fertilizer market like this ever -- even in the 2008 market," Spratt told DTN. "We are going to face supply issues like never before, I feel."The supply issues aren't related to COVID-19 (although the worldwide pandemic probably hasn't helped any) but they are related to other issues. These include the draining of the fertilizer supply chain in 2020, the chemical plant shutdowns from the freeze in Texas last February and the lack of available fertilizer imports, he said.Spratt said there just is no advantage to importing fertilizer into the U.S. right now."The question is: Will we be able to get fertilizer when we need it?" he said.

Maybe the CC will reveal more insight.,Gregory,,1,1
8 months ago,Well lets see.  There's a $15m charge to recapture previous losses.  And there's $8m charge for the debt refinance.  And the interest expense should go down by $4m next quarter.  That's $27m, or about $2.50 per Q that can be in future distributions.  The question remains though, why were UAN's realized prices for UAN fertilizer and ammonia significantly below the NOLA prices and lower than the Key Market Indicators in the press release?  Remove the charges, lower the interest expense, and sell fertilizer at market prices (how hard is that??) and it seems like $5.00 per unit is reasonable each quarter.More,Geezer31,,9,0
