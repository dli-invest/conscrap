3 months ago,The preliminary number don’t look too bad. EBITDA for 2020 looks great at over $40 million (keep in mind this company is only valued at $32 million)Gross margin percentage is improving.Cash generated improved greatly from 2019Biggest thing for me is debt was reduced by nearly $36 million in less than a year. Even if that debt repayment is down to $20 million for the rest of 2021 we would be down to somewhere around $20 million in debt which is crazy considering we hit nearly $80 million in debt when the pandemic hit!Obviously we will need to wait for the final results to be released, but I like it so far. Here is to a better 2021!More,Razor,,3,0

3 months ago,Looked closely at the company’s leadership team and, frankly, didn’t like what I saw. Most directors are either current or former executives of the company. All look like 65+ years old. The company seems to always operate at near-zero net earnings, which tells me that these old-aged executives probably treat this company as a personal financing machine, than anything else. All they want is to make enough money to pay nice six-figure salaries and bonuses to the executives. I don’t see much motivation to push beyond that. I hold a small position and willing to wait for another pop, but probably will be looking for a more exciting company to replace it in my portfolio.More,AndyV,,2,0

4 months ago,I decided to add a small position to my risky part of the portfolio as well. The company appears to be profitable, with low PE, and a large list to top-tier customers. Half of the long term debt on their Balance Sheet is related to finance leases, which is not really a debt but a convoluted way of accounting for future revenues under IFRS (there is an offset on the asset side). And for the remainder of the  debt, it was reduced by 1/3 since last year, so I think the company is on track of paying it down quick. The only thing I don’t understand is the equity portion - their past losses completely wipe our shareholders equity (which probably explains why SP is so low). I would be really interested to know how they managed to accumulate such losses in the past. But history is not a good indication of the future, so I am having some faith in this company.More,AndyV,,0,0
4 months ago,So, I bit the bullet and bought some of this stock.  Based on the activity on this board, I think the upside is under the radar.  Fundamentals look in place to overcome the debt concern and I believe the market cap should be at least 5X TTM which would bring this stock to over $30.  Heck, I'd take 2X to bring it to $12.,Ed,,1,1
