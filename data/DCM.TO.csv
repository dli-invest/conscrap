3 days ago,I don’t think Q2 is going to be a good quarter on revenue or earnings. Covid will have played a role in that.Just hoping we are continuing to pay down more debt. I think that’s what the market is most interested in right now. Q3 will look much better than this past quarter.More,Razor,,1,0

4 days ago,The volume is still relatively low at 35,000 traded. Today’s drop in share price wouldn’t be insider dumping before the earnings tomorrow or it would be really pathetic for an insider to cash out only 40,000 cad worth of shares and that’s assuming all the selling is coming from the same person. I am excited to see the debt decrease and revenue in tomorrow’s earnings. In general, earning could be really volatile, so some people tend to secure profit and wait for another entry point,Simon,,0,0

5 months ago,The preliminary number don’t look too bad. EBITDA for 2020 looks great at over $40 million (keep in mind this company is only valued at $32 million)Gross margin percentage is improving.Cash generated improved greatly from 2019Biggest thing for me is debt was reduced by nearly $36 million in less than a year. Even if that debt repayment is down to $20 million for the rest of 2021 we would be down to somewhere around $20 million in debt which is crazy considering we hit nearly $80 million in debt when the pandemic hit!Obviously we will need to wait for the final results to be released, but I like it so far. Here is to a better 2021!More,Razor,,3,0

6 months ago,Looked closely at the company’s leadership team and, frankly, didn’t like what I saw. Most directors are either current or former executives of the company. All look like 65+ years old. The company seems to always operate at near-zero net earnings, which tells me that these old-aged executives probably treat this company as a personal financing machine, than anything else. All they want is to make enough money to pay nice six-figure salaries and bonuses to the executives. I don’t see much motivation to push beyond that. I hold a small position and willing to wait for another pop, but probably will be looking for a more exciting company to replace it in my portfolio.More,AndyV,,2,0

7 months ago,I decided to add a small position to my risky part of the portfolio as well. The company appears to be profitable, with low PE, and a large list to top-tier customers. Half of the long term debt on their Balance Sheet is related to finance leases, which is not really a debt but a convoluted way of accounting for future revenues under IFRS (there is an offset on the asset side). And for the remainder of the  debt, it was reduced by 1/3 since last year, so I think the company is on track of paying it down quick. The only thing I don’t understand is the equity portion - their past losses completely wipe our shareholders equity (which probably explains why SP is so low). I would be really interested to know how they managed to accumulate such losses in the past. But history is not a good indication of the future, so I am having some faith in this company.More,AndyV,,0,0
7 months ago,So, I bit the bullet and bought some of this stock.  Based on the activity on this board, I think the upside is under the radar.  Fundamentals look in place to overcome the debt concern and I believe the market cap should be at least 5X TTM which would bring this stock to over $30.  Heck, I'd take 2X to bring it to $12.,Ed,,1,1
