4 days ago,Looked closely at the company’s leadership team and, frankly, didn’t like what I saw. Most directors are either current or former executives of the company. All look like 65+ years old. The company seems to always operate at near-zero net earnings, which tells me that these old-aged executives probably treat this company as a personal financing machine, than anything else. All they want is to make enough money to pay nice six-figure salaries and bonuses to the executives. I don’t see much motivation to push beyond that. I hold a small position and willing to wait for another pop, but probably will be looking for a more exciting company to replace it in my portfolio.More,AndyV,,0,0

last month,I decided to add a small position to my risky part of the portfolio as well. The company appears to be profitable, with low PE, and a large list to top-tier customers. Half of the long term debt on their Balance Sheet is related to finance leases, which is not really a debt but a convoluted way of accounting for future revenues under IFRS (there is an offset on the asset side). And for the remainder of the  debt, it was reduced by 1/3 since last year, so I think the company is on track of paying it down quick. The only thing I don’t understand is the equity portion - their past losses completely wipe our shareholders equity (which probably explains why SP is so low). I would be really interested to know how they managed to accumulate such losses in the past. But history is not a good indication of the future, so I am having some faith in this company.More,AndyV,,0,0
last month,So, I bit the bullet and bought some of this stock.  Based on the activity on this board, I think the upside is under the radar.  Fundamentals look in place to overcome the debt concern and I believe the market cap should be at least 5X TTM which would bring this stock to over $30.  Heck, I'd take 2X to bring it to $12.,Ed,,1,1

last month,Hi everyone.  I just noticed this stock and wonder why the price is so low compared to the Market Cap:TTM ratio.  Looking for any input on the reason this is only trading at 0.1 times TTM?,Ed,,0,0
