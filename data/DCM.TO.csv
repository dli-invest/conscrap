4 hours ago,The chart looks bullish, fundamentals are not bad either for this company IMO. It’s a rather niche business with not that many competitors. Market cap seems ridiculously low. So overall I think it’s a good long term hold in any well diversified portfolio.,AndyV,,0,0

last month,Investors need to be a bit more patient on this one. Richard only became CEO what 7 months ago? He is trying to change almost everything about this company and make it compete in a space that few know that DCM provides and most company’s don’t think about or listen to unless you have a prior relationship to sell it to them. DCM has those existing relationships.Give the man at least a full year to turn this print company into something else.If he’s still not done his job by 2022 Q2 earnings, then maybe give him the gears. But until then, if you are looking for a quick buck, sell and go find a true Tech company or buy some crypto.More,Razor,,4,0

Even if that debt repayment is down to $20 million for the rest of 2021 we would be down to somewhere around $20 million in debt which is crazy considering we hit nearly $80 million in debt when the pandemic hit!Obviously we will need to wait for the final results to be released, but I like it so far.

All they want is to make enough money to pay nice six-figure salaries and bonuses to the executives. I don’t see much motivation to push beyond that.

11 months ago,I decided to add a small position to my risky part of the portfolio as well. The company appears to be profitable, with low PE, and a large list to top-tier customers. Half of the long term debt on their Balance Sheet is related to finance leases, which is not really a debt but a convoluted way of accounting for future revenues under IFRS (there is an offset on the asset side). And for the remainder of the  debt, it was reduced by 1/3 since last year, so I think the company is on track of paying it down quick. The only thing I don’t understand is the equity portion - their past losses completely wipe our shareholders equity (which probably explains why SP is so low). I would be really interested to know how they managed to accumulate such losses in the past. But history is not a good indication of the future, so I am having some faith in this company.More,AndyV,,0,0
11 months ago,So, I bit the bullet and bought some of this stock.  Based on the activity on this board, I think the upside is under the radar.  Fundamentals look in place to overcome the debt concern and I believe the market cap should be at least 5X TTM which would bring this stock to over $30.  Heck, I'd take 2X to bring it to $12.,Ed,,1,1
