1 hour ago,We need a financial report to move this thing (hopefully higher!), and it's been a while since we had one.   I saw that they used to produce them quaterly, but the last one produced was for the year 2019 (till end of jan 2020). Does anyone know about financial report requirements for venture companies?  I tried to look it up, only found the info for full TSX.,Lucky Luc,,0,0

5 months ago,this was from a German stock analysisPredictiv Ai: An unbelievable hammer!From Jens Becker -December 6, 2020 Predictiv Ai in a market comparison: is this price return sufficient?The share achieved a return of 25 percent last year. Compared to stocks from the same sector (“information technology”), Predictiv Ai is 18.13 percent above the average (6.87 percent). The median annual return for securities in the same industry “software” is 9 percent. Predictive Ai is currently 16 percent above this value. Due to the overperformance, we rate the share at this level with a “buy”.The mood at a glanceOne of the soft factors when assessing a share is long-term observation of communication on the Internet. From this point of view, the share of Predictiv Ai has given the following picture for the past few months: The intensity of the discussion, which is shown primarily by the frequency of verbal contributions, has resulted in increased activity on the Internet. Predictiv Ai is therefore rated “Buy” for this factor. According to our measurements, the so-called rate of mood change shows a positive change. This is equivalent to a “Buy” rating. This means that Predictiv Ai is a “buy” value overall.Should Investors Sell Right Now? Or is it worth getting started with the Internet of Things?How is the situation in the RSI?The Relative Strength Index (RSI for short) relates the upward and downward movements of an underlying asset over time and is therefore a good indicator of overbought or underbought stocks. The RSI for the last 7 days for the Predictiv Ai stock has a value of 33.33. On this basis, the share is neither overbought nor -sold and receives a “hold” rating. We now compare the 7-day RSI with the value of the RSI on a 25-day basis (52.83). Here, too, Predictiv Ai is neither overbought nor -sold (value 52.83), so the share also receives a “Hold” rating for the RSI25. All in all, the RSI assessment results in a “hold” rating for Predictiv Ai.Should Internet of Things Investors Sell Right Now? Or is it worth getting started?How will the Internet of Things develop now? Is your money safe in this stock? The answers to these questions and why you need to act now can be found in the latest analysis of the Internet of Things share.More,Nick,,2,0

You could sit on 2500 units until you had 500 left and then reorder because you're not selling 10s of units/day. If you've got 100s or 1000s of orders coming in you're more likely to increase inventory to ensure you meet demand in a timely manner.,Stock boy,,2,0
7 months ago,There's video up its in French on the ici radio canada site. Heres a rough translationFor those who dont speak french, here is the translation of the Radio-Canada video posted earlier today:It begins by saying thermalpass is a disruptive technology that was developed in Canada. Then CEO talks about the specifics of the product, 24 sensors, similar to those we have in hospitals, talks about the light code system (red = bad and green = good). The reporter then says its faster than the usual thermometer and that thermalpass can analyse approx. 60 persons per minute, which could help reduce waiting time in stores, hospitals, school, various buildings, security checks in airport, arena, stadium. CEO says that he wanted a product that wasn’t intimidating and that could fit well in the different areas it is meant to be. He then talks about its competitors, the infrared images, and how some people worry about their potential risks regarding the protection of their private lifes. He says thermalpass has no camera so there is no way to connect your face to some medical datas which some might not want. The reporter says that Predictiv AI is one of the few companies that has obtained an accelerated establishment license for medical equipment in Canada, which goal is to deploy novel solutions faster. It ends by saying that all the assembling and molding is made in Ontario (Windsor and Guelph) and that it takes up to 5 weeks to produce.Hope this helps! Good things to come for PAI shareholders !!More,Stock boy,,6,0
7 months ago,I was told that they had 30,000 sensors that is enough for 1,500 units.then I was told that the $1.5 Million raised some is going to be used to buy an additional 20,000 sensors that is enough for 1,000 so that is a total of 2,500 units.  Now you can do the math!! :),Nick,,2,0

7 months ago,From an interesting article. While Internet of Things Inc may not have a solid rumor to push the equity sky high as of yet, it does have notable and significant customer connections that should be identified. The ThermalPass by ITT comes from a joint venture with the tech company and Commersive Solutions, a firm with extensive retail experience, connections and customer base.Notable clients of Commersive include Microsoft, whom the company has worked with extensively on projects such as retail promotion of Xbox One and Microsoft Office, as well as McDonalds, whom it worked with to develop the use of its downloadable food ordering app. While the former represents potential office use opportunities for the ThermalPass system, the latter is much more significant given the sprawl of McDonalds restaurant internationally.More,Stock boy,,0,0

7 months ago,This came out a while ago, but the word is getting out!!Promising stock figures by German analysts“An absolute gift”, headlined the German Finanztrends after closely researching the status and potential of the stock. Based on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), the share is currently a hold share. The index reads different values measuring upward and downward movements over various time periods. The results are very positive as it appears that both values for the RSI7 (16.13%) and RSI25 (24.32%) give a buy status, resulting in a buy rating. The buy recommendation does not change until the percentage is higher than 30%. This means that the share has a strong market position, which can be confirmed again by the following numbers.In the past 12 months, Predictiv AI achieved a performance of 25%. Comparable shares from the software and AI industry are up 5.37% on average, proving the company’s much better progress with 19.63% over the same period of time. The information technology sector had a median of 3.89% in 2019, while Predictiv AI was 21.11% above this average. The good performances shown with both numbers results in another buy rating for the share in this category.More,Nick,,5,0

8 months ago,Rollout of Thermal Pass is in about another week, we do know that they have at least 1,000 orders.  Just guessing but if they get $2,500 each that is $2.5 million and at a p/e of 20 that makes the value of the company $50,000,000 which is 11.5 times the current market cap.  So.... Current share price of 0.017 equals a share price of 0.1955. If they have sales of 10,000 that equates to a share price of $1.955 all calculated before the split.,Nick,,3,0
8 months ago,I will tell you one thing when this stock is finally split, most of the volatility will go away.  Today there were 350,494 shares traded and at 0.0172 that is a measly $6,028  but enough to influence the price. (I bought more and was $2,000 of that total)Market cap is $4.8 Million (at close today) with what is on the horizon really can't imagine it getting shaved too much (if at all) when it splits.  A couple days after it splits then the share price will get in align with the pre-order sales, then you can start making assumptions on a P/E ratio, to get a new hypothetical share price.  Basically the risk in the stock will be mostly eliminated.  I feel we are in the BUY ON THE RUMOR stage, and have to wait to SELL ON THE NEWS (or hold and go for a ride)More,Nick,,9,0

8 months ago,I am sure Thermal Pass works, you never ask a question that you don't already know the answer.  They are just getting their ducks in a row before roll-out.  They have also aligned themselves with Get Ready™ and Protect Your Office to create Safe Site Global Association. “This alliance will provide workplaces with the first comprehensive, end-to-end Infection Prevention and Control (“IPAC”) solution, along with policies and detailed procedures, infrastructure, PPE supplies and technology applications to minimize risk of spreading contagions”.It is just a matter of time before roll out, as they already have a que of sales.In regards to the stock split, they are of course are doing it to get their share price up and to shrink the obscene level of outstanding shares.  And they do probably want to get on the NASDAQ but they need a market cap of $45,000,000 which they are nowhere near.  They also need 550 shareholders, which I don't know if they meet that requirement . The only way they get listed is to get sales rolling and get their market cap up.  But that is going to take a few months.The value is there, you just have to be patient, and not be influenced by little guys getting spooked because they lose 50 bucks.I am in this close to a million shares, I keep buying as it, in my opinion is a bargain.I am not invested thinking this is going to change my life, this is my gambling money, my other money is in AMD, JD, NARI, SLV, IHI to name a few.  I am going to just sit tight and go on vacation.More,Nick,,7,0

I been waiting patiently I bought at 4 cents then sold and made a small profit then bought at 5 cents and then screwed up and ended upselling again without makigna profit then I heard about thermal pass way back and bought at 0.8 cents and regret that price But I am very optimistic in the news the CEOs and all the people involved with this project it just makes alot of sense.. based on this data  its supposed to do every good.Lets hope everything goes well.i got 3200 in this let's go this thermal pass.More,Ataullah,,5,0

last year,Any that bought at .04 or lower look to take some profits just incase if this is short lived you made 100-150% return in some cases which is insane on a penny stock.   Keep some for possible future moves but understand the markets we are in during this pandemic.   These moves are a gift right now.,Sebastian,,0,0

2 years ago,I’m not sure if many of you have had time to see the people on the board of directors and the accomplishments they have made in their careers.  I’m impressed that this company is able to attract these individuals especially in the spaces they are known for.  I have a strange feeling that when this stock has a chance to move it could be in large waves.,Sebastian,,1,0

2 years ago,This seems like garbage, but the world is going to be connecting to 5G in the next decade, this is a strong buy for long term gains, and its so cheap right now, that I don't think anyone would miss the $200/month to get 5000 shares for the next rolling 12 months. worth the speculative buy i.m.o,dcbeauchesne,,0,0
