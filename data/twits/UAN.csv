@WallStPirate excellent article! So, the reality is starting to sink in, in my brain at least, that a minimum of 43% of the worlds nitrogen exports have stopped. This being just what Russia, China, and Netherlands exported in the past. GONE! This is freaking scary. Between war, natural gas prices, and Covid.... It&#39;s like every country for themselves. People are going to starve! That&#39;s the reality. Nitrogen fertilizer prices are going to go ballistic and it&#39;s going to take much longer to resolve, I&#39;m thinking 10 years before we can regain stability in the nitrogen fertilizer market globally.   farmdocdaily.illinois.edu/,2022-04-27T12:08:06Z

$BTU Up today, but a tale of 2 stories.     
 
What is working 
Added to my $BTU position as it is recovering today after stellar earnings from ARCH.  IMO this company got sold off with Energy and presents an opportunity.  Russia just announced they are cutting off gas to Poland in response to sanctions; another catalyst.  ER before the market open Thursday should be similar to ARCH.  
$METC also recovering 
 
Fertilizer is also a buy.  Early innings of WW shortage.  $CF and $UAN recovering well today, but UAN should be the stronger candidate.  
 
What is not working, but still holding 
China has really screwed tech with their complete failure managing Covid.  Beijing adding to shutdowns.  The impact of which will not be known until we get some earnings out of the way.  Texas instruments will report after the close.   Decent ER from MSFT and Goog will help too.    
 
Holding large positions in these losing stocks.
