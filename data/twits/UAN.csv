$CVX Oil, Coal and Fertilizer stocks under pressure due war negotiations, Covid restrictions in Shanghai and US and Europe talking of reintroducing the Wartime Windfall tax of upwards on 95% on profits.  Tax was used in WWII and Korean war to tax companies’ profits that benefited from the war.   
 
If passed would take profits from companies and shareholders and give it to the government.   
 
Spot coal prices down 16%.  
 
My holdings that are being impacted.

$UAN From the trades

Fertilizer Price Index at Record as Ukraine War Tightens Supply
As the war in Ukraine enters its fourth week, urea and phosphate keep climbing at New Orleans (NOLA) and in Brazil, Europe and the Middle East. An ammonia sale by Nutrien at $1,650 a metric ton indicates Tampa ammonia could top its record by 40% in April. Potash prices jumped in NOLA and Brazil to almost 2x last month&#39;s Chinese annual contract.
Fertilizer Prices Remain Firm-to-Higher
All major fertilizer prices are steady or up in early week trading, with the bullish trend expected to continue as India soon tenders for more urea and Tampa ammonia is bought for April. On top of good demand, nitrogen, phosphates and potash all have significant supply issues, led by the war in Ukraine, sanctions on Russia and Belarus, high European natural gas prices and a lack of exports from China.,2022-03-24T13:36:51Z
