$UAN   $CF  $NTR    Bernini’s announced there will be a Budget Committee hearing on Tuesday April 5 on his Windfall profit tax.   

It will be interesting how broad he tries to casts his net through the economy.   His opening speech at today’s hearing on the Biden Budget was pure Democrat AOC.  

The 2022 Windfall tax debate continues.,2022-03-31T01:44:20Z

$UAN $CF interesting read - &quot;As a result of those high prices, the Saskatchewan government, which released its budget last Wednesday, projected $1.5 billion in potash revenue for 2022-23, up from the 2021-22 forecast of $420 million, Reuters reported.&quot;

$UAN  The WindFall tax Headwind facing this industry is real.  The cheerleaders on this board dismiss the tax as with little chance of final passage.  Bernie ideas aren’t very marketable. 

In the end that maybe true.  But Bernie is The Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.  So the issue will be fully aired on the hill.  Committee on both side are chaired by Democrats.  

Reports that the tax was last used in Korea are mistaken.   It was used in the 1970’s during the Arab oil embargo.  Two years.  

Initial Bernie proposal 3 years total with 70% the first year and rising to 95%.   Those number are all negotiable I’m sure.

$CVX Oil, Coal and Fertilizer stocks under pressure due war negotiations, Covid restrictions in Shanghai and US and Europe talking of reintroducing the Wartime Windfall tax of upwards on 95% on profits.  Tax was used in WWII and Korean war to tax companies’ profits that benefited from the war.   
 
If passed would take profits from companies and shareholders and give it to the government.   
 
Spot coal prices down 16%.
