$UAN   This little stock,  11 million shares outstanding, sure does trade a big volume.  My Thinkorswim account says 40000 shares by 9:57.  68,000 by 10:07.   Of course its down 6 points today with the market up and $CF and $NTR both unchanged.  Seems out of step but a big seller must be working.  

But the CVR investor relations shows the volume at only 12,000 as of 9:57.  The stats on the CVR Investor Relations page are provided by Refinitiv Financial Solutions.   They must really suck at counting.  To be be so off.  

My Thinkorswim account has 4x the volume number of Refinitiv.   At 10:07 the website had only 14,670 vs 68,000 on Sinkorswim.  

But hay.  There is a 11 million shares float - tiny tiny tiny.   

Getting physical delivery of a trade is a real problem.  Confirmation is half the battle.  Getting the shares for a DTC delivery is the problem.  And it‚Äôs caused by so many trades being phony.   

The SEC needs clean this phony trading up.

$UAN From the trades this morning

Ammonia Prices Climb Amid Supply Concerns
Ammonia prices jumped in Europe and the Middle East amid more European plant closings due to high natural-gas prices and the absence of Russian tons due to sanctions and Black Sea port closures. The price strength carried over into the U.S., where Koch and CF Industries boosted ammonia prices in the Eastern Corn Belt as spring demand picks up. Prices jumped for New Orleans (NOLA) urea as well, and stronger urea prices in the Middle East were seen as the industry awaits a new tender from India and expectations of even steeper prices.
Price increases at NOLA and inland were also reported for urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) and ammonium sulfate, with the latter fueled by a $60 a short ton (st) price hike from AdvanSix. NOLA and inland phosphate and potash prices also ratcheted up to the higher end of the previous week‚Äôs ranges.,2022-03-21T16:33:15Z

$UAN a run into an expiration is typical of a share shortage.  Covered calls are being swept up from 100 and up.  Not sure if the $5.25 cash distribution is required at settlement.  5% rule might apply.
