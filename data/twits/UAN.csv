Fertilizer Price Index at Record as Ukraine War Tightens Supply
As the war in Ukraine enters its fourth week, urea and phosphate keep climbing at New Orleans (NOLA) and in Brazil, Europe and the Middle East. An ammonia sale by Nutrien at $1,650 a metric ton indicates Tampa ammonia could top its record by 40% in April. Potash prices jumped in NOLA and Brazil to almost 2x last month&#39;s Chinese annual contract.
Fertilizer Prices Remain Firm-to-Higher
All major fertilizer prices are steady or up in early week trading, with the bullish trend expected to continue as India soon tenders for more urea and Tampa ammonia is bought for April. On top of good demand, nitrogen, phosphates and potash all have significant supply issues, led by the war in Ukraine, sanctions on Russia and Belarus, high European natural gas prices and a lack of exports from China.,2022-03-24T13:36:51Z

$UAN &#39;#Brazilian granular #potash offers firm at $1,000/T CFR. Russian #MOP still available, Canadian material thin, Belarusian tonnes sold out. Buyers told &#39;take it or leave it&#39; on tonnes. Few offers for Indian import tenders amid supply security concerns.

$UAN   This little stock,  11 million shares outstanding, sure does trade a big volume.  My Thinkorswim account says 40000 shares by 9:57.  68,000 by 10:07.   Of course its down 6 points today with the market up and $CF and $NTR both unchanged.  Seems out of step but a big seller must be working.  

But the CVR investor relations shows the volume at only 12,000 as of 9:57.  The stats on the CVR Investor Relations page are provided by Refinitiv Financial Solutions.   They must really suck at counting.  To be be so off.  

My Thinkorswim account has 4x the volume number of Refinitiv.   At 10:07 the website had only 14,670 vs 68,000 on Sinkorswim.  

But hay.  There is a 11 million shares float - tiny tiny tiny.   

Getting physical delivery of a trade is a real problem.  Confirmation is half the battle.  Getting the shares for a DTC delivery is the problem.  And it’s caused by so many trades being phony.   

The SEC needs clean this phony trading up.

Ammonia Prices Climb Amid Supply Concerns
Ammonia prices jumped in Europe and the Middle East amid more European plant closings due to high natural-gas prices and the absence of Russian tons due to sanctions and Black Sea port closures. The price strength carried over into the U.S., where Koch and CF Industries boosted ammonia prices in the Eastern Corn Belt as spring demand picks up. Prices jumped for New Orleans (NOLA) urea as well, and stronger urea prices in the Middle East were seen as the industry awaits a new tender from India and expectations of even steeper prices.
Price increases at NOLA and inland were also reported for urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) and ammonium sulfate, with the latter fueled by a $60 a short ton (st) price hike from AdvanSix. NOLA and inland phosphate and potash prices also ratcheted up to the higher end of the previous week’s ranges.,2022-03-21T16:33:15Z
