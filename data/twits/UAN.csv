$UAN Do we expect UAN to touch $680 one year from now?  I would say that it is well in the range of possibilities. A lot has to happen over that time frame that is hardly set in stone. When I see summer fill pricing, it will be pretty obvious what prices will be for the rest of this year, and I will feel more comfortable making a real projection. 
 I do expect UAN to be vastly higher a year from now.,2022-04-20T22:22:01Z
