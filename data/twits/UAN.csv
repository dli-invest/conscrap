$UAN This stock is going up.  National security asset.  A quote from Vilsack

• Unfortunately, the U.S. today is reliant “on someone who feels that they can just invade another country for something that’s critical to agriculture -- fertilizer,” Vilsack says at a
bioeconomy conference in Washington
o “Fertilizer costs have gone up in part” because of dependence on Russia, Vilsack says • Says he met earlier with agriculture ministers from Latin America and South America
o “To a person they expressed concern about the impact of fertilizer on their ability to grow the crops and their ability to feed the world”: Vilsack,2022-03-17T14:58:25Z

$UAN    Fertilizer Prices Jump Again as War Heightens Supply Concern
As Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine enters its third week, urea and phosphate prices spiked anew, particularly in New Orleans (NOLA) and offshore markets such as Brazil and Egypt. Rising natural gas prices will keep Europe&#39;s ammonia producers offline in the near term. Potash prices also jumped in NOLA and Brazil, which imports significant volume from Russia.

China&#39;s Export Shift Could Provide Supply Relief
China may lift its fertilizer export ban in 2Q, providing supply and price relief to farmers. A turn toward energy protectionism led China to suspend urea and phosphate fertilizer exports from 3Q through May. We expect China to extend the ban through June to build domestic inventories. Still, China can&#39;t replace the 7 million tons of urea exports lost if Russia halts shipments; China&#39;s annual export capacity is only 4- 6 million tons. The export ban has had little impact on China&#39;s domestic urea prices, which have been supported by higher natural gas and coal costs.
China is the marginal producer for both phosphate and urea fertilizers, accounting for 10% of global urea exports and 30% of finished phosphate exports.,2022-03-10T14:08:20Z
