&quot;They said they can&#39;t even get fertilizer. Those farmers told me people have no idea what is coming&quot; 
 
&quot;Union Pacific is arbitrarily decreasing shipments of fertilizer which will cause a major disruption in food production. Everyone should write/call their reps&quot; 
 
&quot;My family owns a small farm. We are forgoing fertilizer this year due to the extreme cost increase. If we are doing it so are many others&quot; 
 
China plays the LONG GAME &amp; now we know why they loaded up on grains in the past year.  
 
Folks prepare with the hopes that you &amp; your family will hopefully NOT NEED IT but prepare.
