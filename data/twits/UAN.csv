$BTU Up today, but a tale of 2 stories.     
 
What is working 
Added to my $BTU position as it is recovering today after stellar earnings from ARCH.  IMO this company got sold off with Energy and presents an opportunity.  Russia just announced they are cutting off gas to Poland in response to sanctions; another catalyst.  ER before the market open Thursday should be similar to ARCH.  
$METC also recovering 
 
Fertilizer is also a buy.  Early innings of WW shortage.  $CF and $UAN recovering well today, but UAN should be the stronger candidate.  
 
What is not working, but still holding 
China has really screwed tech with their complete failure managing Covid.  Beijing adding to shutdowns.  The impact of which will not be known until we get some earnings out of the way.  Texas instruments will report after the close.   Decent ER from MSFT and Goog will help too.    
 
Holding large positions in these losing stocks.

On days like today you panic sell &amp; LYA or you unleash your investment strategy‚Ä¶cutting disappointments &amp; laggards to buy the dip on names you were envious of or greedy for more based on said strategy &amp; fundamentals.  I make the most trades on days like these and those trades have been my most successful these past couple years.

$UAN Expected to post $10 to $14 per share ebitda q1 22, and likely over $20 for q2, and north of $60 for all of 2022.  By winter 2022 should have a very solid idea what 2023 will look like, which could likely be the same or more.  Will take years to get new plants online.,2022-04-23T22:06:12Z
