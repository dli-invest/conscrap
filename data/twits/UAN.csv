China&#39;s Export Shift Could Provide Supply Relief
China may lift its fertilizer export ban in 2Q, providing supply and price relief to farmers. A turn toward energy protectionism led China to suspend urea and phosphate fertilizer exports from 3Q through May. We expect China to extend the ban through June to build domestic inventories. Still, China can&#39;t replace the 7 million tons of urea exports lost if Russia halts shipments; China&#39;s annual export capacity is only 4- 6 million tons. The export ban has had little impact on China&#39;s domestic urea prices, which have been supported by higher natural gas and coal costs.
China is the marginal producer for both phosphate and urea fertilizers, accounting for 10% of global urea exports and 30% of finished phosphate exports.,2022-03-10T14:08:20Z

$CVI I don‚Äôt know why people are down on this one.  Oil and gas side has likely $120-$140 barrel oil coming, and fertilizer side ($UAN) has nothing but higher prices until this war is over. Unlike oil, where the world is willing to let Iran replace Russia, there is no ‚Äúother‚Äù source of fertilizer. The world just needs the stuff.,2022-03-04T17:01:29Z
$CVI might give you a tiny tiny dip‚Ä¶.if you‚Äôre lucky. 

@WaterWings curious if you know the answer to this, since UAN is paying a dividend, and CVI owns some of $UAN, does CVI drop due to the paid out cash like UAN would, or does CVI get some of that cash?,2022-03-04T15:52:15Z
