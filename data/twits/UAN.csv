$UAN From the trades this morning

Ammonia Prices Climb Amid Supply Concerns
Ammonia prices jumped in Europe and the Middle East amid more European plant closings due to high natural-gas prices and the absence of Russian tons due to sanctions and Black Sea port closures. The price strength carried over into the U.S., where Koch and CF Industries boosted ammonia prices in the Eastern Corn Belt as spring demand picks up. Prices jumped for New Orleans (NOLA) urea as well, and stronger urea prices in the Middle East were seen as the industry awaits a new tender from India and expectations of even steeper prices.
Price increases at NOLA and inland were also reported for urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) and ammonium sulfate, with the latter fueled by a $60 a short ton (st) price hike from AdvanSix. NOLA and inland phosphate and potash prices also ratcheted up to the higher end of the previous week‚Äôs ranges.,2022-03-21T16:33:15Z

$UAN a run into an expiration is typical of a share shortage.  Covered calls are being swept up from 100 and up.  Not sure if the $5.25 cash distribution is required at settlement.  5% rule might apply.

$UAN UAN has lagged behind LXU, CF and generally all other fertilizer equities.  This baby will catch up eventually.  I don&#39;t know if it will go vertical like LXU, but it will catch up. 
 
People a lot smarter than me, who live and breath fertilizer think that UAN will hit a MINIMUM of $300 by 2023.  I would add more, if I wasn&#39;t already up to my eyeballs in UAN. High fertilizer prices should take this to $400 by the time the fertilizer run is over in 2023/2024. 
 
If you have a chance to top up.  You should do so.,2022-03-18T15:43:30Z

$UAN This stock is going up.  National security asset.  A quote from Vilsack

‚Ä¢ Unfortunately, the U.S. today is reliant ‚Äúon someone who feels that they can just invade another country for something that‚Äôs critical to agriculture -- fertilizer,‚Äù Vilsack says at a
bioeconomy conference in Washington
o ‚ÄúFertilizer costs have gone up in part‚Äù because of dependence on Russia, Vilsack says ‚Ä¢ Says he met earlier with agriculture ministers from Latin America and South America
o ‚ÄúTo a person they expressed concern about the impact of fertilizer on their ability to grow the crops and their ability to feed the world‚Äù: Vilsack,2022-03-17T14:58:25Z
