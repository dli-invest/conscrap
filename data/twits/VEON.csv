$VEON: The Revenue growth is accelerating: in the next 5 years the growth will be better than in the last years. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/VEON/fundamental-analysis?key=445d9fe3-aee8-4c41-b367-0fa986377b57&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=VEON&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-05-15T01:59:00Z
$VEON my .13Â¢ of shib is worth .12Â¢ now. Why oh why do I listen to Pompers !?!,2022-05-14T20:12:37Z
Wow this is a big change! $VEON&#39;s price moved below its 50-day Moving Average on May 9, 2022. View odds for this and other indicators: https://srnk.us/go/3663441,2022-05-14T18:11:24Z

This is because Senator Rand prevented the quick passing of the 40B Ukraine bill. He simply asked that someone be hired to oversee and track where all the money went. Is that such a crazy request? If his request is accepted it will delay things by a few weeks and leave Ukraine with a few weeks without supplies.

If this bill is delayed a long time, it may incentivize progress in peace talks.,2022-05-14T15:29:56Z

My $30 of Shibu is losing ðŸ˜‚. 

It&#39;s down to $24 or something! In less than 24 hours ðŸ˜‚.

In 4 years when I show my kids what $30 of VEON vs $30 of Dog Coin 2 did, well.....that will make for a fun lesson.  

By 2026, I conservatively predict $30 worth of VEON will be worth probably $160-$200, if not way more. And $30 of dog coin 2 will be worth $10.

I of course wish you well and hope you will make millions, but realistically it&#39;s not likely.

Prove me wrong Dog Coin 2! Make Melonball a millionaire.,2022-05-14T14:31:41Z
$VEON  Under .50 is a blessing! The thing I like most about VEON is that itâ€™s one of those stocks I can just buy in and leave alone. Unlike TBLT which I was invested in awhile back before their recent 2ND REVERSE SPLIT! I have much more faith here after doing all my DD. VEON = Patience ðŸ’° ðŸ“ˆ,2022-05-14T04:29:09Z
$VEON I will continue to add until I either see a profit or go bankrupt trying. Have a great weekend VEON. I will see you Monday morning.,2022-05-14T02:27:37Z
$VEON 

In Melonball&#39;s honor I have purchased $30 bucks of Dog Coin #2 (Shibu) 

I will use it an educational tool for my kids in a few years and compare it to my VEON, which I&#39;m sure VEON will be up in the $2-3 plus range by that point 

And I&#39;ll be like &quot;the moral of the story kids is dog coin money gets dog food results when compared to a real company&quot;. ðŸ˜†

Bullish for VEON. 

Amused to show my kids a $30 lesson in a few years.,2022-05-13T22:36:18Z
$VEON big picture question: what&#39;s up with the ever-declining SP of VEON since &#39;09? I understand it could bounce back to $1 or $2 (a big deal), but why such an erosion of value over the past 12+ years?,2022-05-13T21:16:11Z
$VEON seems that Morgan Stanley sold nearly all of their stakes. I think most of the funds who targeted to liquidate with a big loss almost finished.,2022-05-13T20:39:10Z

@ChollyV 

We look forward to your post next week giving us an update of where the tutes are at.

The float is getting very tiny I believe.,2022-05-13T20:12:14Z
$VEON so weird. Whatever Iâ€™m at 13k shares now. Couldnâ€™t be happier. The longer we stay under 50, the more I will keep loading,2022-05-13T20:03:48Z
$VEON 

Good thing we are selling the Georgia VEON unit. 

One less potential problem area to worry about.,2022-05-13T18:38:27Z
$STNG trimmed more 28.45 from average in 13s and rotated to more $VEON â€¦ still holding some STNG for 30s+ but VEON has such massive upside from here,2022-05-13T18:10:37Z

Hmmm..

$VEON I have a feeling we are gonna end red or close to it.  We get a 5% pop and it bleeds down by market close.,2022-05-13T17:22:35Z
$VEON kinna crazy to see this low p/e stock. All stocks are up north p/e or - p/e.,2022-05-13T17:07:51Z

$VEON Volume is the lowest I have seen since I have invited..  With even a little bump could easily get above .50...,2022-05-13T16:32:37Z
$VEON Just sold my $1000 of Dogcoin and pocketed $20 and put $1400 in more VEON.  Not a lot but it all adds to the position!  I have to use RH for this.  POYYF can&#39;t be purchased on RH.  I am sticking to RH for VEON for more shares from now to end of year.,2022-05-13T16:26:53Z
$VEON I am new. Does it really matter about delist from main exchange?,2022-05-13T15:44:04Z
$VEON 1.23 gap fill is a matter of time â€¦ long term 2+ easy, and with dividends weâ€™re looking at 300-500% over next couple years - the risk-reward here is incredible imo,2022-05-13T15:00:54Z
$VEON  Allianz added 5m shares, it didn&#39;t have any before,2022-05-13T14:59:56Z
