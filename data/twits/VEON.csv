$VEON Does anyone else find it interesting that except for the 3Q21 ER and right as the Russian/Ukraine conflict started, every losing streak since August lasted for 9 days on the money counting the day it went red to the bottom of the drop. Some had a red day or two after, but the lowest closing was always on the 9th day. This last one you could say was 8, since day nine it rallied slightly.,2022-05-17T02:38:06Z
