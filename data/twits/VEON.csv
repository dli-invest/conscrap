The war is gonna drag out until end of year is my guess. 

They are mobilizing a significant amount of the civilian population.

However, I&#39;m seeing many reports in the Donbas that these quickly trained civilian forces are in some cases living on almost zero rations and their commanders have left them with orders to stay put. As a result of poor leadership, support, and supplies many of these units are surrendering or refusing to fight.

So while another 700,000 means the war drags on, these guys are quickly figuring out that war is hell and without proper support, leadership, and supplies they are not willing to fight.

Bullish for peace by end of year. And still bullish on all the impacted stocks listed.,2022-05-31T20:09:58Z

$VEON This stock has lots of highs and lows because it is a penny stock now.  Might be a good stock to buy and sell repeatedly to make even further gains.  Ultimately, the stock will hit $2 at some point in time, so you shouldn&#39;t end up holding the bag.,2022-05-31T18:07:06Z

Just checking in from my desk job. My MM caps says it loves the panic and lack of patience it&#39;s seeing. That means potential discounts from paperhands.
