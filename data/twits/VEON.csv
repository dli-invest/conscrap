Looks like Croatia also does not support Finland ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡® or Sweden ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª joining NATO.

All NATO members have to be in agreement to let anyone else into the alliance. NATO has become the modern equivalent of the Articles of Confederation. ðŸ˜‚

So now we have TWO countries against their admission. Croatia ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡· and Turkey ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡· both say NO. Looks like those Nordic Countries cannot support the Kurds and get NATO admission. And now they have to choose if they will throw the Kurds under the bus or get NATO admission. They probably won&#39;t treat the Kurds like disposable paper because we will all see their moral hypocrisy if they do.

This is good news they will likely get stopped from joining NATO. This will allow for cooler heads to prevail. Right now emotions are running high. Blocking their admission will very likely help peace come quicker.

See post below showing an average consensus near $2. That&#39;s a 4X from today&#39;s price. 

People have to talk, text, and do data. In 2008 people stopped paying their mortgages before they stopped paying their cellphone bill. People are hooked to their phones.

VEON operates in a space that does well in pretty much all market conditions. And because it will do well and has done well, I know management will bring a dividend back. 

4X capital gains (at least) and a juicy dividend make this an easy buy and hold.,2022-05-20T00:30:33Z

Embarrassing that retail investors are buying crap like ( insert meme stock here) instead of quality like VEON. 

I will be sure to periodically tease them after the first dividend check hits my bank account. ðŸ˜Ž,2022-05-19T21:04:07Z

$VEON I feel like the price is being suppressed so that calls will be cheap, once they get their cheap calls they let it fly and chaching!!!!!,2022-05-19T19:17:08Z

Please barcode around 50 cents until I have at least 175,000 shares that I liberate from the hands of the impatient.

Thank you MM for considering my request.,2022-05-19T17:16:15Z

Don&#39;t hate me, BUT this can stay at 50 cents for the next few months. 

I am not done liberating shares from the unworthy paperhands. Every payday, their shares shall be liberated and given a good home in my portfolio!,2022-05-19T16:33:37Z

This guy lives there. The strengthening of the Ruble ( Russia Beeline) should offset the weakness of the Grivna ( Kyivstar Ukraine) . This is especially true since the bulk of Revenue comes from Russia. VEON will be okay.,2022-05-19T14:29:44Z
AABB and BMIX are my favorites right now for massive upside from current SP 
NLST and $VEON are my favorites for multiples from here at minimal (imo) risk (3x+ HIGHLY likely within the next year for both imo) 
 
$TMC and ASTS other longs for massive growth potential,2022-05-19T14:25:39Z
