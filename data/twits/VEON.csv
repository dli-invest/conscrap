The US government is punishing US citizens who hold Russian bonds.  (See picture below)

Remember this in November. I for one will never vote for anyone who supports disrupting bond payments. They are trying to force Russia into a technical default. And this is complete BS. Russia has the USD in unsanctioned accounts, is willing to pay in USD, and the US government is blocking it. The US should be considered in default for blocking payments. Not Russia.

Shame on Biden. Shame on his vile corruption. Shame on his wretched government for hurting innocent US bondholders. 

I am ashamed of my government.,2022-05-24T19:10:02Z

$VEON little by little. Everyday and all day long. Can not use margin so I do not have to worry about margin call. We love made in usa and cheap stocks such as $snap, $TSLA‚Ä¶. and hate Russian stock such as $veon‚Ä¶.,2022-05-24T16:30:39Z
$VEON got my shares at my price now it would be nice for it to go upüòÅ,2022-05-24T15:54:16Z
$VEON hey crash.. tell me what I was missing? VEON down every damn day for weeks and occasionally goes up 1% but continues to be down 10+% weekly. Why the F would anyone hold onto this? If I choose, I can buy back in at a lower pps at any given time so I ask again.. What am I missing besides the continuation of losing money?,2022-05-24T15:52:30Z
$VEON Damn... Everyone left..,2022-05-24T15:26:03Z
$VEON,2022-05-24T15:06:33Z
$VEON Still feel this way but it is just a feeling... Feelings don&#39;t make you money... Feelings cost you money, and sometimes a fortune..,2022-05-24T15:05:29Z
$VEON We might take a hit on the financial side due to war and financial environment.. Not as much as the other sectors in the markets. Look at everyone around you and yourself.  Is anyone giving up their cellphone service or apps? No one I know is.. They will give up driving and switch to generic food first.. Cellphone service is one of the last things people will do without..,2022-05-24T15:01:58Z
$VEON Vent... Makes you feel better.. I vent but still am here for the return and dividends later...,2022-05-24T14:54:21Z

$VEON I am actually concerned that we will see a real impact to finances that could justify a drop back to $0.30.   The strength of the Ruble however is a definite plus.,2022-05-24T14:19:05Z
