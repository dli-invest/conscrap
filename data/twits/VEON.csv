Turkey ain&#39;t budging. Finland ain&#39;t budging. 

There will be no NATO expansion. This will help get us closer to peace.

@Kain_C64 I&#39;m hoping to send you a private message, please follow me so we can chat about $VEON - I‚Äôm researching it this weekend. My main questions are: If it‚Äôs based in Amsterdam and operating in 8 countries, why was it affected so much by the Ukraine situation? Is it dependent on the easing of Russian sanctions to regain it share price? How likely is it to be delisted from Nasdaq because it‚Äôs under $1?  It‚Äôs an intriguing stock - thanks for all you do for Polymetal, by the way. üëç,2022-06-11T12:28:03Z

$RDBX I have made a promise to myself not to let a stock become more than 7%, with the exception of $veon, of my portfolio, so every time I trim a little bit off the top of this one and average down into something else or other things I end up losing more money on those other things and this keeps creeping past 7% all over again.  
 
Lesson learned you can&#39;t fight it this is extreme momentum...,2022-06-10T23:51:01Z

Russia dropped their interest rates today. And the Ruble is the best performing currency in 2022.,2022-06-10T22:54:33Z

I really hope VEON partners with $ASTS. 

I am definitely going to pester VEON to do so. 

ASTS can expand VEON&#39;s network Into remote parts of Pakistan, Russia, Uzbekistan etc etc etc!

If you think VEON partnering with Starlink in Ukraine was big news, trust me. An ASTS partnership will be bigger once phase 1 of their network is up and running.,2022-06-10T21:01:26Z

$VEON I‚Äôm curious how this stock is being affected by Roth firms not allowing any purchases. Vanguard stopped me out a few months ago. Is that just them or all of them?,2022-06-10T17:54:42Z

$VEON 

8.6% inflation....thanks Brandon. 

And VEON completely ignored that news. Why? Because they can raise their prices and people will pay it. Why? Because people gotta talk, text, and data.

 And in America during 2008, people skipped on their mortgages before they skipped on their cellphone bill. Would behavior be different in other countries? Maybe, but probably not.

VEON is looking strong.,2022-06-10T16:10:22Z
