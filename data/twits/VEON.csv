$VEON maybe one more dip to clear out stop losses before we move up?
I like being in this position - very optimistic about long term value here and buy orders waiting below‚Ä¶ either way we move is a win üëçüèº,2022-06-04T04:21:26Z

Interesting. It says McDonald&#39;s has 15 years to buy their restaurants back. 

The fact they were able to sell ( no one forced them to leave Russia or to sell) is positive news for the overall situation as we progress toward a negotiated peace. 

I will not be surprised to be McDonald&#39;s buying back in within 10 years. 

Right now the stock market is punishing Russian stocks or stocks with a heavy Russian presence, but I think that will change dramatically by end of the year. Our stocks will be worth üí∞üí∞üí∞!

Lamestream media networks are conditioning the NPCs to accept the coming negotiated peace. 

Bullish for the negotiated peace, which is great for the mentioned tickers.

It sure would be great if the political instability in Pakistan would just take a chill pill.

Not necessarily good news for VEON, but we can do just fine if crap hits the fan there.

Slightly misleading title, BUT Biden basically is open to it. 

Bullish for peace and these tickers.

$VEON $LUKOY $POYYF $SBRCY I&#39;ve shared this video someplace before but I feel the need to share again on these tickers since I see a lot of misaligned comments especially from new visitors to these tickers who have zero understanding of international politics.  If you want to trade Russian stocks and hold longer term then you should be spending time watching this ENTIRE video and truly understanding the geo political history and perspectives.   
 
Also, I have to say it&#39;s a pleasure to watch Lex Fridman interviewing Oliver Stone.  Two amazing thinkers.   
 
Watch if you want to gain new insight into history and this ongoing situation.
