We have entered a very interesting phase of the war in Ukraine.

I&#39;m hearing numerous accounts of guys getting ordered on the streets to report for mandatory duty.

And now we have child soldiers. 
Ukraine is not in a good place when they start using child soldiers.

A negotiated peace is coming. When this leaks leaks to EU there will be moral outrage. They can&#39;t accept child soldiers. Also, they can&#39;t afford to keep funding a war when their economies are getting flushed down the toilet. 

That&#39;s the interesting thing. Data suggests both Europeans and Americans support the war as long as it doesn&#39;t hurt their economies. It already is and will continue to. Give it a few more months of economic pain and both USA and European citizens will be demanding a negotiated peace.

Kissinger has recently strongly suggested at Davos this needs to happen in the next 2 months or else bad things will happen. Bullish for peace.,2022-05-26T21:34:53Z

He is offering a solution to stop or significantly reduce the impending food crisis. It&#39;s time to get trade flowing again. Especially food!

Africa, Asia, South America, and Oceania are watching the US and Europe. The ball is in their court. Do they pick maintaining sanctions and letting the world starve or do they pick free trade and saving lives? Also, enjoy the $$$$ grocery bill in North America and Europe if they decide to keep the sanctions up.  I&#39;m certainly not. 

Peace will come eventually. I&#39;m bullish for peace.,2022-05-26T21:12:11Z

I sure hope VEON is helping connect all their protesting customers with food vendors who are using Jazz Cash ( since reports are coming in the ATMs are out of cash).

$VEON Have a great day/evening ðŸ¤—â˜•,2022-05-26T12:59:54Z
$VEON I don&#39;t usually chart the PM/AH, but I like to look at it because there are typically no gaps so it sometimes gives me a little insight in to how the day might go (lows/highs).  Notice this morning that my bottom line of the wedge held and my BB crossover and reversal happened.   Still in the wedge so could bounce back between .45ish and .48ish for a little while.  This is the hourly chart.,2022-05-26T12:48:28Z
