$VEON,2022-05-20T22:38:00Z
$VEON If the conflict turns into a war of attrition that drags on for years, won&#39;t $VEON eventually be delisted if it cannot get above $1 for at least 10 days?  

I think, like most of us, we want the war to end quickly.  But if it does not, most of the stocks dependent on the outcome of the war will simply remain at current levels indefinitely. 

I don&#39;t see $VEON $POYYF or $LUKOY paying dividends as long as the uncertainty in the region is so high.,2022-05-20T22:32:50Z
$VEON I am almost ready to turn bear on VEON! I am almost ready to say they will be delisted by this time next year because they canâ€™t get their sorry asses above $1!  I am almost there, not yet, but almost!,2022-05-20T21:49:21Z

$VEON another day of barcoding ?,2022-05-20T13:54:47Z
According to the VanEck website, current portfolio allocation of $RSX is 75% cash and 25% stocks, with **20.44%** of those stocks comprised of $VEON. The remaining 5% is heavy oil and natural resources (OGZD, ROSN, etc). 
 
â€“ Has this portfolio allocation changed, and if so, when? Is there a resource/website with these monthly changes? 
 
Very interested in seeing what price $ERUS gets in liquidation for likely similar shut down of RSX.,2022-05-20T13:33:08Z

Looks like Croatia also does not support Finland ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡® or Sweden ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª joining NATO.

All NATO members have to be in agreement to let anyone else into the alliance. NATO has become the modern equivalent of the Articles of Confederation. ðŸ˜‚

So now we have TWO countries against their admission. Croatia ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡· and Turkey ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡· both say NO. Looks like those Nordic Countries cannot support the Kurds and get NATO admission. And now they have to choose if they will throw the Kurds under the bus or get NATO admission. They probably won&#39;t treat the Kurds like disposable paper because we will all see their moral hypocrisy if they do.

This is good news they will likely get stopped from joining NATO. This will allow for cooler heads to prevail. Right now emotions are running high. Blocking their admission will very likely help peace come quicker.

$VEON 

See post below showing an average consensus near $2. That&#39;s a 4X from today&#39;s price. 

People have to talk, text, and do data. In 2008 people stopped paying their mortgages before they stopped paying their cellphone bill. People are hooked to their phones.

VEON operates in a space that does well in pretty much all market conditions. And because it will do well and has done well, I know management will bring a dividend back. 

4X capital gains (at least) and a juicy dividend make this an easy buy and hold.,2022-05-20T00:30:33Z
