$VEON when are earnings?,2022-06-05T13:47:23Z
$VEON There are obviously many reasons why VEON&#39;s revenue might be impacted by the Ukraine conflict. However, Q1 showed strong resilience with EBITDA growth in all reporting units. EBITDA was primarily impacted by currency exchanges. If VEON can be as resilient in Q2, earnings could swing to a 3.1% EBITA increase on currency exchange alone.  
 
 It&#39;s possible VEON has been so quiet because this is part of their plan. A full quarter of unimpacted earning could move this strongly in the right direction and allow for a final push over $1 if necessary with a special dividend due to the excessive cash on hand.,2022-06-05T12:36:51Z

Oh yeah, they want a negotiated peace!

Interesting. It says McDonald&#39;s has 15 years to buy their restaurants back. 

The fact they were able to sell ( no one forced them to leave Russia or to sell) is positive news for the overall situation as we progress toward a negotiated peace. 

I will not be surprised to be McDonald&#39;s buying back in within 10 years. 

Right now the stock market is punishing Russian stocks or stocks with a heavy Russian presence, but I think that will change dramatically by end of the year. Our stocks will be worth üí∞üí∞üí∞!

Lamestream media networks are conditioning the NPCs to accept the coming negotiated peace. 

Bullish for the negotiated peace, which is great for the mentioned tickers.

It sure would be great if the political instability in Pakistan would just take a chill pill.

Not necessarily good news for VEON, but we can do just fine if crap hits the fan there.
