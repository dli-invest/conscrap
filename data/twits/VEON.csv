$VEON I think we will be trading in this range until the next ER which Etrade shows is August 4. They are not always correct. I bought this extremely cheap on the March crash and not stressing while waiting it out. The topside is likely $1.50-$2.00 where it traded most of 2021 with monthly options available for CC. 
The caveat for further downside is the extent of the damage to facilities and just how many Ukrainians 
might have left their cell service behind or unable to pay their bill. 
 The numbers are staggering according to the BBC. 
&quot;More than 14 million people have fled their homes since Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine, the United Nations (UN) says. Almost seven million left for neighboring countries, while eight million people are displaced inside Ukraine itself.&quot; 
However, if they are like most cell addicts on the planet, they will do everything to keep that phone up and running. 
Long common and selling monthly calls to reduce my  
per share cost.

$VEON - Let‚Äôs just let more people die b/c of Zelenskyys ego. ‚ÄúStalemate not an option‚Äù, yet begging for more western support while 97% of Luhansk has been taken by Russia.  
 
I‚Äôm not saying he does not have good intentions, but let‚Äôs be real. Good luck not bringing more dead bodies home due to your ignorance.,2022-06-07T22:31:20Z

$VEON volume started to increase today, there is a one seller constantly above $0.50-$0.51 with 300K+ stocks, I expect one institution to wipe off that sell order and this will start the momentum upwards. For now, I haven&#39;t seen that sell order yet but I see it everyday for the previous days.,2022-06-07T15:06:52Z
$VEON MTS is the market leader telco operator in Russia. Was around 270 rouble on 13-Feb-2022, just before war. Now it is again 270 rouble. VEON is much more diversified telco operator compared to MTS and is more elastic than MTS in terms of war effects. VEON will jump back to pre-war levels just like MTS. Both are doing same business, VEON is much better in terms of diversification. 
 
Check MTS price from yourselves.

Just so I am clear, about Biden being a tyrant......

$VEON keep telling yourself that it sells for ‚ÄúX‚Äù on other markets overseas and keep believing that ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a matter of time before it goes up‚Äù. Keep buying more shares in VEON and continue throwing your money away. You have a better chance of winning the lottery than you do with VEON ever seeing $1 pps without a massive R/S!,2022-06-07T14:03:44Z
$VEON y‚Äôall should get out of VEON! Down again today. When will people learn that VEON is a money pit that goes down every day? Sure it will go up 5% every now and then but week after week, you continue to lose money because week after week, VEON closes the week IN THE RED!,2022-06-07T14:01:03Z

$VEON VEON Ltd., whose market valuation is $1.02 billion at the time of this writing. Investors‚Äô optimism about the company‚Äôs current quarter earnings report is understandable.
