The recently kicked out PM of Pakistan is leading THIS convoy to the capital to demand a fresh election.

This gives a good recap of the current unrest in Pakistan. 

Not necessarily bad for VEON unless it leads to civil war, which it could. But even then, people still gotta talk, text, and do data. The last civil war, decades ago, resulted in the creation of Bangladesh. 

I&#39;m not saying civil war will happen, but it&#39;s a possibility.

Also, if this scares you I&#39;m buying more shares tomorrow.

No cash in the ATMs.....if only there was a digital solution....like JAZZ CASH

Things are a little wild in Pakistan too, but fortunately this too shall pass.

$VEON I just wish we could sell covered calls while waiting. Sucks the only available strikes are so high.,2022-05-25T20:52:42Z

$VEON bought another 225k shares, i have a total of 500k shares now ü§ûüèª,2022-05-25T20:19:15Z
$VEON I can&#39;t imagine there are many people shorting this.  My guess is that the near fear-mongering is an attempt to drive the price down to simply hope to pick up shares for much cheaper.  A good strategy, I guess.  We all benefit from that if we are actively adding.,2022-05-25T20:14:13Z

Dear paperhands, 

Dump now. Abandon ship. Flee. 

I want your shares for cheap. Please sell them to me for cheap. 25 cents? 35 cents! I can only hope!,2022-05-25T20:12:00Z
$VEON imagine that. VEON down again today. Glad I got out yesterday.,2022-05-25T20:05:11Z

We already know VEON is able to move debt to the Russian unit. 

What if VEON is drawing down on their LOC to then move more debt to the Russian unit? 

The strong Ruble could make it easier to pay off some of these foreign demoninated debts. 

I&#39;m very interested to see if they are going to pull off another smart financial engineering move.

Oh and weak hands, just sell your shares. You will feel better. Holding is not for you. Maybe if you are lucky, you can buy back in for cheaper. 

I&#39;m currently liberating your shares every pay day. I&#39;ll give them a good home in my portfolio.,2022-05-25T18:44:43Z
$VEON Sell and leave crying bitch.  If you already sold, move on nothing here for you to complain about. You luck your wound and move on.   https://seekingalpha.com/news/3842645-veon-issues-update-on-24-billion-liquidity-amid-russia-turmoil,2022-05-25T18:42:06Z
$VEON The cash draw down is bad enough but you have to understand that people want to hammer Russia by hammering anyone who is doing any business with Russia.. Putin put VEON in a very very bad situation...they just keep slamming it and will continue... 
No joking about it...VEON is poisonous to hold right now,2022-05-25T18:28:06Z
$VEON So they announce that they&#39;ve increased their liquidity by borrowing $692M (about the amount of the DJezzy sale) right before they announce their AGM with a record date of 5/25. So in effect, they can pay a dividend without decreasing cash or increasing their EBITDA/Debt ratio. Probably pie in the sky, but just saying...,2022-05-25T18:14:04Z
