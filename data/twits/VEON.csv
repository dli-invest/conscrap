$VEON unfortunately there is still room for downside here. This could trade between .35 cents to .60 cents for the rest of the year. Keep nibbling my friendsâ€¦,2022-05-22T00:53:26Z

$VEON 

Chances of getting rich from VEON by end of 2022 or 2023 are quite high.

As long as it&#39;s under a dollar, I&#39;m still buying.,2022-05-21T14:53:10Z

$VEON  Sell us your shares. Short the stock. Say all you want, but this stock will take off in due time. If it can hit below .40, Iâ€™ll get myself an order for 20K more shares. Iâ€™m in it for dividends and honestly to just support VEON itself, much respect for how the leaders run the company.,2022-05-21T11:49:12Z

$VEON If the conflict turns into a war of attrition that drags on for years, won&#39;t $VEON eventually be delisted if it cannot get above $1 for at least 10 days?  

I think, like most of us, we want the war to end quickly.  But if it does not, most of the stocks dependent on the outcome of the war will simply remain at current levels indefinitely. 

I don&#39;t see $VEON $POYYF or $LUKOY paying dividends as long as the uncertainty in the region is so high.,2022-05-20T22:32:50Z
$VEON I am almost ready to turn bear on VEON! I am almost ready to say they will be delisted by this time next year because they canâ€™t get their sorry asses above $1!  I am almost there, not yet, but almost!,2022-05-20T21:49:21Z

$VEON another day of barcoding ?,2022-05-20T13:54:47Z
According to the VanEck website, current portfolio allocation of $RSX is 75% cash and 25% stocks, with **20.44%** of those stocks comprised of $VEON. The remaining 5% is heavy oil and natural resources (OGZD, ROSN, etc). 
 
â€“ Has this portfolio allocation changed, and if so, when? Is there a resource/website with these monthly changes? 
 
Very interested in seeing what price $ERUS gets in liquidation for likely similar shut down of RSX.,2022-05-20T13:33:08Z
$VEON Have a wonderful day ðŸ¤—,2022-05-20T13:08:42Z
