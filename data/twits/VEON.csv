Deepening of economic ties between Russia and Pakistan.

Food in Pakistan can help it avoid Sri Lanka level of instability.

Good news for VEON especially.,2022-05-29T12:51:21Z

Negotiations 101: 

When you control the energy they need, you set the terms. 

When you control the food they need, you set the terms. 

When you control the fertilizer supply they need, you set the terms.

When the rest of the world can&#39;t replace your supply of stuff and they can&#39;t take your supply of stuff by economic or military force, you set the terms. 

When their sanctions are hurting their economies more than your economy, you set the terms.

When major economic players are willing and eager to trade with you, you set the terms to those who won&#39;t.

When your military continues to defeat everything they send, (evidenced by gaining ground every day), you set the terms.

The fact is this: Russia gets to set the terms of how this will end. And with election season coming up....Americans hate supporting a war that causes us to suffer economically as we are.

$VEON Zelensky is too stubborn to admit Russia has control over the regions they wanted. He should just let go and we&#39;ll see peace soon. Time Europe opens their eyes as well with their big shoutings that leads to nowhere. Rubel recovered and Putin selling his oil to China, Europe getting poorer and poorer, that&#39;s the reality and what I feel in my pockets when I go shopping. So just give up man and give those regions to Putin, he wins, accept it and we can move on again.,2022-05-28T12:01:51Z
