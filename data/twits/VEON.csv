Do you believe the company is worth at least a 3X of EBITDA? 

Do you believe the management is incentivized to bring the share price up? 

Do you believe management will bring the dividend back as they have stated is their intent? 

If yes, buy and hold. Buy more when you can. Patience. Patience PATIENCE for the win!

$VEON just realized if I diversify my portfolio I don&#39;t have to spam other tickers about my s***** ideas of how much I could have would have should have made somewhere else instead of staying in a strong play and waiting patiently,2022-06-14T20:53:10Z

So you think a share buyback is a good idea for VEON?

 I&#39;m bullish on Polymetal regardless if the split into two companies happens or not.

$VEON Just realized that if I&#39;d bought into $EDU or $GOTU back when I first bought $VEON ,I would&#39;ve doubled my money in 3 months. Now, I&#39;m bagholding with a real chance of this dropping further.
