$VEON 

News released today 3PM EST.
‚Ä¢After initial confusion in the market, U.S. banks by Wednesday determined that they were cleared to trade VEON&#39;s bonds because most of its revenue came from outside Russia, according to a bondholder. The Netherlands-based company derived over 42% of its revenue from Russia in 2021, company filings showed, with the rest coming from several other countries including Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Bangladesh.VEON has not commented at this time.,2022-06-09T23:41:36Z

WASHINGTON ‚Äî The United States has relied almost entirely on China ‚Äî and to a lesser extent Russia ‚Äî in recent years to procure a critical mineral that is vital to producing ammunition. 
 
The mineral antimony is critical to the defense-industrial supply chain and is needed to produce everything from armor-piercing bullets and explosives to nuclear weapons as well as sundry other military equipment, such as night vision goggles.,2022-06-09T18:13:58Z

The nice thing about VEON is that it will fly once one of the following happens:

1. Return of the regular dividend 
2. Special dividend declared
3. Peace happens
4. Retail Investors vacuum up all the shares. The actual float is quite tiny.

Feels good to own VEON.,2022-06-09T16:13:04Z
$VEON come on guys. I commit to buy 10K stocks for each $0.01 increase. If retails get interested in this stock, it will fly, fundamentals are superb in this stock, they are doing cash and income generating business! 
 
@Kain_C64 what do you commit?,2022-06-09T15:39:29Z

Where is our resident bear-bull? 

He&#39;s been incognito for 2-3 days now? 

But seriously, if this could stop trying to move up for a few more months, I&#39;d appreciate it. I need more shares on the cheap.,2022-06-09T14:47:17Z
$VEON @Kain_C64 thanks for sharing. 635K shares on my side. Planning to buy 1.25 million shares on the way to $1.5,2022-06-09T14:31:49Z
$VEON 

Added 1,000 more shares. Now 163,000 shares. 

Just 12,000 more shares to go for my goal of 175,000.,2022-06-09T14:18:06Z
$VEON 55K buy order at $0.5070. I guess it will sweep orders and take it over $0.52 soon.,2022-06-09T13:58:10Z
$VEON there comes another bull 90K buy order at $0.5015,2022-06-09T13:49:46Z
$VEON if we somehow create momentum in retail, this stock will easily fly, because institutions will not sell, their avg cost is much higher than $1.50. If there is a retail momentum here, there will not be so much sell orders.,2022-06-09T13:48:03Z
$VEON dropped another 10k,2022-06-09T13:45:33Z
$VEON there comes our bull!!! 200K order at $0.5011. It will start momentum if we pass over $0.52,2022-06-09T13:45:24Z
$VEON still someone/institution/MM trying to suppress this stock. Put 21K order at $0.51,2022-06-09T13:33:44Z
$VEON this is my favorite long term great deal. Should have bought more instead of the crap I bought,2022-06-09T13:22:08Z
