Polymetal bros

While we can&#39;t buy anymore Polymetal, for now, I want to draw your attention to $VEON.

I have 163,000 shares of VEON and I&#39;m adding 1,000 shares every payday.

I think VEON is a steal at this prices! It&#39;s a great company, with great management, and is a great FCF machine.

Here&#39;s one reason I think VEON is a great value:

$VEON We could see a brief relief rally now we have the expected .75 interest rate behind us. Not good for company loans though but a recession is far more worse. We will need to sweat this rough times out, meanwhile brave investors are probably loading and I&#39;m one of those ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª,2022-06-15T18:58:49Z

Are you retired? Do you have a pension? 

Biden sure &quot;loves&quot; your pension.

 US sanctions on Russia have caused this. Anyone who says otherwise hasn&#39;t been paying attention. Russia is trying to pay in USD, but US is making it difficult. Russia then offered to pay in Rubles. But Biden is a POS.

Last man standing. VEON. 

As long as VEON&#39;s Russia revenues stay under 50% we will dodge sanctions and avoid the freezing of buying or selling of shares.

I&#39;m still adding 1,000 shares of VEON every paycheck.,2022-06-15T17:37:56Z

Got off the phone with Schwab. Read some sanctions. Here is what I found out. Here is why Polymetal is not tradeable. 

VEON, pay attention. If revenue goes over 50% Revenue Russia, VEON gets frozen too. FYI.Not a problem if you are a dividend investors, but if you are trading in and out of it, you won&#39;t be able to anymore. And heaven have mercy on shorts of these frozen stocks. They are stuck paying perpetual interest while they can never exit ðŸ˜‚.

$VEON Iâ€™m in this for the long run. Goal is to have over 100k shares of which half I will sell when this goes over $1.75 and the other half Iâ€™ll keep for dividends. This is a retirement stock so I donâ€™t care what state itâ€™s in now as long as the company keep making a good product/service.,2022-06-15T15:19:48Z

Well. I hope you bought all the shares you wanted of Polymetal.

If Polymetal is in fact sanctioned now, it may be because more than 50% of our revenue comes from Russia. This just means we can&#39;t buy or sell the shares. The last EO specifically says you can still hold your sanctioned shares and you dont have to dispose of them. But no selling, unless to a non-American.

Now that&#39;s of course slightly different if you have an ADR ( $AUCOY ) instead of shares of POYYF. The bank sponsoring the ADR may cancel them. However, you should still be able to convert them into POYYF from my understanding.

So it looks like $VEON is the last man standing. It&#39;s the last Russia related stock that is still buyable.,2022-06-15T15:18:47Z
