$IDKFF hey SI &quot;just trust me&quot; is not nearly enough in today&#39;s information age. I really don&#39;t understand why there aren&#39;t significantly more disclosures about the holdings. We are only working with 20% of the story. Impossible to know how to proceed,2021-11-10T17:42:28Z

$IDKFF what does this news mean exactly? That they will disclose (for example monthly) how much their investments are worth and if any purchases or sales were made? If that&#39;s the case then ThreeD could be much better valued because of better insight in their financials I&#39;d say.,2021-11-06T22:02:26Z

Every one of these tickers had massive increases in share price starting at mid August and crescendoing at the end of September. They all share a connection by being marketed by Florton Artias consulting, aka StockFam. I&#39;m trying to figure out what made all the share prices rise so dramatically in tandem. Surely that wasn&#39;t a coincidence.   I know StockFam has been pitching some, like Peak, for many months now, but I don&#39;t know about the rest. Did SF come out with a better outreach technique or something?  https://www.flortonartias.com/,2021-10-14T21:03:02Z
$IDKFF avged down at .80 today. As soon as this Peak delisting stuff gets straightened out, I can‚Äôt see this staying below a dollar for long.,2021-10-13T02:02:05Z
