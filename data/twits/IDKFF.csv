$IDKFF slapping the ask right in the face.,2021-05-19T19:33:59Z
$IDKFF I would pick $IDKFF over $VSQTF any day of the week. Copied from someone on the discord:

Insane YoY and quarterly growth for $IDKFF. NAV increased from 29.3m at 31 Dec to 57.3m at 31 March, a 95% gain. Pretty much flat during the months March and April, even though growth stocks were crushed. Currently trading at a 0.6 multiple to 30 April NAV per share (68% upside to reach NAV). Taking into account the current discount, the fact that some of its holdings were hit pretty hard in March and April (e.g. $SXOOF and $BTCWF), upcoming catalysts for certain holdings (e.g. $PKKFF) and some of the private holdings going public this year, I&#39;d say there is quite the disconnect between SP and value here...,2021-05-18T14:00:12Z
