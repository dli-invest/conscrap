$DMYI Just dropping by to say hi IonQ Fam! I&#39;M STILL HERE. 

I haven&#39;t sold, and never will, because that&#39;s just plain stupid. 

Been more focused on crypto plays as of recent, because stonks (SPACs ESPECIALLY!) haven&#39;t had the same kind of movement they did last year and crypto has been BOOMING. Always good to remember though that when the hype isn&#39;t around yet, that&#39;s likely the best time to buy and accumulate. This is supposedly what &#39;Smart Money&#39; does. 

Speaking of crypto, just imagine if (and when) IonQ starts renting out computational power to blockchain miners... the profitability and possibilities of this company could be endless, and we may just be incredibly early to one of the most revolutionary parties. 

Onwards and upwards my friends.,2021-04-29T04:49:50Z

My retirement plan:
$ASTS - 5G satellite direct to mobile phone (investors: Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Samsung)
$DMYI - Quantum computing (investors: US dep. of energy)
$AACQ - Biodegradable plastic (investors Pepsi, NestlÃ©, Danone)

Love the combo of growth and it being backed-up by big companies who would benefit greatly. All long term holds.,2021-04-27T09:46:12Z

$DMYI So glad the vote and merger are happening later. Even if we come into a bear market for the next year, this share price is outstanding.

Every time I think about my Alma mater, all the good things coming out of College Park, or read into all the people studying quantum computing it brings a smile to my face.

Some weeks back I scheduled a tour of the QIS facility at Sandia National Labs where I work. Here are the notes from meeting with Susan Clark .
They currently have one system 3 qubit system. Hope is to scale to 32 by the end of the 5-year DOE program funded by the Office of Scienceâ€™s Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) program. They are 2 years in.  Susan did her Post-Doc work at University of Maryland.  Starting work in spin qubit research, but then learned of Chris Monroe&#39;s work and quickly joined his team developing Ion Trap systems. She is an acolyte of Dr. Monroe.  She took over the Trapped Ion Group after her colleague who previously ran the lab left forâ€¦.IonQ. Her QCOUT group has already lost 2 people to IonQ.   They decided to go with Trapped Ion approach because of Susanâ€™s experience, Honeywell and IonQ have created a market for the parts they need to spin up a program quickly.  The technology is proven, available and hence cheap.

$DMYI Enjoy these salad days when few people and actual investors on this board and itâ€™s not full of paid pumpers and bashers...that will change once this starts getting noticed by the masses.

$DMYI funny to see bears and bulls on here. Can we all just admit no one has any idea what this will do? This is a long term play that could potentially change the world on a massive scale, or it could fail. Im willing to risk some money on it because quantum computing is the future one way or another. I like whose involved with this and that it hasnt gotten a pump. GL those holding a position long term.,2021-04-23T19:50:49Z
