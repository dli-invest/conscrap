$DMYI So, does this react like $ARQQ or $IRNT at the close of the merger 9/28 or does it trade flat or down? IonQ is a better quantum play than either of those IMO (I own ARQQ). Will the new Chinese Evergrande macro infection cause the market to ignore the closing and give us an opportunity to buy more under $10?,2021-09-20T17:05:18Z
