$DMYI well I spent so much of my savings on IonQ and $HBAR.X, I&#39;m glad I just got another summer job to replenish the coffers! This is what investing is all about. Put it in your favorite things until your broke, go make more money, wash, rinse, repeat until your investments pay off. $IPOE finally turning my way and $WPF still a winner too :-),2021-05-24T22:54:59Z

$DMYI More evidence of government as a strong quantum computing tailwind can be found in the recent congressional hearing below. Chris Monroe speaks at minute 47, and answers several subsequent questions. Lots of pieces are lining up for IonQ.

A couple of technological aspects I look forward to understanding further include: (1) published data from their latest 30+ qubit machines in a peer-reviewed journal, and (2) significance of slower gate speeds with trapped ions compared with competing technologies.

He added that the University of Maryland‚Äôs support is contributing to the industry‚Äôs growth. Last year, the university opened the new Quantum Data Center, a 23,000 square foot center in the campus Discovery District.

Charles Winthrop Clark, a fellow at the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Joint Quantum Institute, offered a more measured but still optimistic view of quantum computing‚Äôs potential in the region. He notes that while a quantum industry won‚Äôt do for the Washington metro region what the digital revolution did for Silicon Valley, ‚Äúthere will be a lively quantum ecosystem in the DMV.‚Äù
