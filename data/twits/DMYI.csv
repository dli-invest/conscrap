$DMYI This company (or a very similar one that does it before) has the power to collapse the entire cryptocurrency sector with previous profit before. Let me explain, they would first get bitcoins (mainly) in large quantities, and sell them to the market at huge profits. When this became known, some time later, or announced, the entire cryptocurrency system would collapse. Like a house of cards. Mark my words. This will happen. A system cannot survive when a player is a god. The rest of the players leave the game.,2021-09-10T11:27:39Z

$DMYI De Masi says: &quot;the proof of our investment thesis for all of them is their ability to outperform expectations&quot;.

Given today&#39;s tripling expectation for 2021 Contract Bookings do you really think that their potentially very conservative estimate of revenue of ca. 500 M in 2026 couldn&#39;t be revised upward anytime in the future?

Btw. today we have highest daily volume since May - smart investors are buying ;),2021-09-09T18:54:47Z
$DMYI Remember that PIPE investors have their shares at 10 dollars. Not like other SPACS where they have their shares cheaper than us (e.g JOBY at $9). Therefore, there will be no downward pressure from PIPE investors in this case.,2021-09-09T17:45:13Z
$DMYI The main hypothesis of &quot;bashers&quot; that &quot;all SPACs fall after merger&quot; was finally disproved.

Here you have some recent deSPACs - speculative low floaters:

EFTR max SP 40+
ARQQ max SP 26
IRNT max SP 39 (AH)

For months &quot;no one&quot; wanted the above-mentioned and they stayed flat at 10.

I told you that SPACs will be back in play but you weren&#39;t listening.

And now RKLB - today max 20.88. The last one neared 10B in market cap and certainly is not a low floater.

Now let&#39;s make a comparison of EV/EBIDTA between RKLB and DMYI/IONQ.

RKLB has EBIDTA estmate for 2026 of 340M while IONQ - 272M. Current EV of IONQ is  1.38B and today&#39;s peak EV of RKLB was ca. 9.3B. This indicates EV/EBIDTA (2026) of 27.3. Equalizing this multiple gives potential SP of IONQ of ca. 34. This is pure mathematics.

If you oppose to that tell me ANY SINGLE REASON why IONQ should have lower EV/EBIDTA than RKLB. I am open to discussion.,2021-09-09T17:17:21Z
