My retirement plan:
$ASTS - 5G satellite direct to mobile phone (investors: Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Samsung)
$DMYI - Quantum computing (investors: US dep. of energy)
$AACQ - Biodegradable plastic (investors Pepsi, NestlÃ©, Danone)

Love the combo of growth and it being backed-up by big companies who would benefit greatly. All long term holds.,2021-04-27T09:46:12Z

$AAPL CEO Tim Cook and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams both got MBA at Duke and Tim Cook is currently on their board. It&#39;s located in Durham, NC which is part of the Research Triangle Park, where $AAPL is investing $1 Billion. They are investing in &quot;machine learning, artificial intelligence, software engineering and other related fields.[1] Duke Startup IONQ is a quantum computing company that&#39;s being taken public by $DMYI.

$DMYI So glad the vote and merger are happening later. Even if we come into a bear market for the next year, this share price is outstanding.

Every time I think about my Alma mater, all the good things coming out of College Park, or read into all the people studying quantum computing it brings a smile to my face.

Some weeks back I scheduled a tour of the QIS facility at Sandia National Labs where I work. Here are the notes from meeting with Susan Clark .
They currently have one system 3 qubit system. Hope is to scale to 32 by the end of the 5-year DOE program funded by the Office of Scienceâ€™s Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) program. They are 2 years in.  Susan did her Post-Doc work at University of Maryland.  Starting work in spin qubit research, but then learned of Chris Monroe&#39;s work and quickly joined his team developing Ion Trap systems. She is an acolyte of Dr. Monroe.  She took over the Trapped Ion Group after her colleague who previously ran the lab left forâ€¦.IonQ. Her QCOUT group has already lost 2 people to IonQ.   They decided to go with Trapped Ion approach because of Susanâ€™s experience, Honeywell and IonQ have created a market for the parts they need to spin up a program quickly.  The technology is proven, available and hence cheap.

$DMYI Enjoy these salad days when few people and actual investors on this board and itâ€™s not full of paid pumpers and bashers...that will change once this starts getting noticed by the masses. Smart money are the backers and weâ€™re next in line , congrats fellow long investors of the future have a good weekend,2021-04-24T04:28:31Z
$MUDS Yâ€™all should be throwing your cash at $DMYI if you want a solid SPAC play. The only pure quantum computing play. So far at least.,2021-04-24T02:10:10Z
$MVIS $DMYI Imagine what an IonQ small quantum computer onboard could do for MVIS? How about finding optimal crash avoidance path? Discerning whether the side of a semi truck trailer is sky or not. The combos are crazy. And the future of auto drive.,2021-04-24T01:50:46Z

$DMYI funny to see bears and bulls on here. Can we all just admit no one has any idea what this will do? This is a long term play that could potentially change the world on a massive scale, or it could fail. Im willing to risk some money on it because quantum computing is the future one way or another. I like whose involved with this and that it hasnt gotten a pump. GL those holding a position long term.,2021-04-23T19:50:49Z

$DMYI Does searching for the $DMYI cashtag on Twitter work for anyone else? Is it banned for having some sinister alternate meaning? What&#39;s going on here.,2021-04-22T13:26:39Z
$DMYI This is the best SPAC in my opinion. Such a great investor team (best of all SPACs), large cash position after merger (no need for further capital raises), promising industry. And with the current prices a great opportunity I guess,2021-04-22T11:33:50Z
$DMYI added some more at .30s today...orders are filling very slowly...got the feeling the float is going quickly,2021-04-22T03:13:10Z
