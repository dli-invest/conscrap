$DMYI whether this goes up at merge or drops, we can all agree that it will and it won‚Äôt.,2021-08-31T04:35:15Z

$SOFI For those of you wondering about recent despac performance, i wanted to share this from another stock I am invested. $dmyi, its still useful,2021-08-29T19:26:29Z
$DMYI omg .. amazing company.. nesws was great I&#39;ll buy more 
I got 20k,2021-08-29T13:30:06Z
$DMYI This isn&#39;t one to add guys. I can understand the hype around quantum but they are still years away. Just keep on your watch list. Its kinda like the super early stages of blockchain before bitcoin. Long way to go.,2021-08-28T23:51:53Z
$DMYI Added this week‚Ä¶look at DFNS for a taste of what this will do when merger is complete,2021-08-28T22:01:17Z

$DMYI JOBY is rising today. Currently 13.13. Some says that 13 meanis bad luck. Maybe for shorts? :D 

I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if JOBY hits ATH soon.

And not only me thinking so. Because some trader(s) bought today more than 7K calls with 15 strike and more than 5K with 17.5 strike, both expiring in October 15.

And if Joby hits ATH, you&#39;d see how high can DMYI (IONQ) fly SHORTLY AFTER MERGER.,2021-08-27T18:26:36Z
$DMYI can‚Äôt get 100 share buy to fill at the bid at 9.97‚Ä¶float drying up or TD lagging,2021-08-27T17:40:51Z
$DMYI when will the $10 floor be removed? Is the voting date 28 Sept the last day or having the option to redeem at $10?,2021-08-27T14:34:03Z

$DMYI I don&#39;t usually make recommendations, but I think that with GNPK I should make an exception with my friends at IONQ. Investigate it, it is a gem. Space industry, INFRASTRUCTURE, valued at 0.6B after the merger (the vote takes place in a few days). It has more revenues than most SPACS in the same sector, and its forecasts for 2024 are also higher. It is very large, 800 employees, and it has been created from the union of several space companies, it is like a holding company, but without the intention of being one, that is, it is a single perfectly interconnected company. Incredibly cheap, to the point that analysts and experts always ask the CEO why he gets it so cheap. The company is called REDWIRE.,2021-08-26T21:04:05Z
$DMYI Let&#39;s make comparison of other disruptive de-SPACs with IONQ - based on CURRENT market caps:

1. QS, 8.8B
2. JOBY 7B
3. CHPT 6.9B
4. SPCE 6.5B
5. LAZR 6.1B

and IONQ (DMYI) &lt;2B

And now ask yourself which of them has the highest growth potential.,2021-08-26T20:14:49Z
$DMYI smart for them to release good news right before merger. Perhaps it will discourage redemptions. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s their hope,2021-08-26T16:31:09Z
$DMYI With the special dedication for all those &quot;experienced financial strategists&quot; and &quot;long-term investors&quot; here who are so sure about their crazy idea that DMYI/IONQ will fall instantly after completion of merger, ignoring empirical facts about similar companies&#39; price movements:

Mr. Niccolo says CLEARLY:

&quot;I suspect this is a business that will close its transaction in Q3. And I think THERE&#39;S GOING TO BE A LOT OF RUNNING AWAY WITH IT, as they say, as people figure out what we have here and people figure out how much customer interest there is in this company&quot;.

What does this: &quot;run away with&quot; mean in your opinion? Instant stock price drop?! I would say, the converse!!!

PS. Soon we will see, who was right here!,2021-08-26T15:28:29Z
$DMYI waiting for $7 to go all in, this will drop 2,000 times p/s for a science project at $2b will not hold in this despac environment,2021-08-26T15:22:57Z

$DMYI It looks like they might have 100s of qubits much sooner than they projected. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvzU748e0V4,2021-08-25T17:18:20Z
$DMYI &quot;Starting with the demonstration of 4 chains of 16 ions each that can be dynamically configured into quantum computing cores, IonQ believes it has laid the foundation for increases to qubit count into the triple digits on a single chip, as well as future Parallel Multicore Quantum Processing Units.&quot;,2021-08-25T17:10:18Z
