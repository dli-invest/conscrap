$DMYI With the special dedication to all those who still (!) predicts drop  below 10, despite the fact of SP moving out from side trend supported by highest monthly volume ever, I am comparing for EV/EBIDTA for 2025 year between IONQ and DNA.

Comparison is based of their Investor Presentation, excludes  warrants, includes redemption of shares.  

As for now DNA has EV/EBIDTA (2025) of ca. 125 (!).
If the same EV/EBIDTA were to be applied to DMYI/IONQ, the shares&#39; price shall be... above $41. AND NOW, NOT IN 5, 10 years!

AT the same time IONQ has stronger backings than DNA, smaller market cap and float and - last but not least - HIGHEST CAGR!

And remember: market discounts the future!

Thus, although there are always risks, I doubt, the market shall be such ineffective and act like self-fulfilling prophecy of fools predicting drop. How they say? &quot;Market knows better&quot; and &quot;Majority is ALWAYS WRONG&quot;!

Let see who is right soon!,2021-09-29T02:48:08Z

‚ÄúCut losses early, let gains run, don‚Äôt put more cash into a falling stock unless you have high conviction and a long term trading plan, and put more funds into a winning investment (average up on long term winners).‚Äù,2021-09-29T02:45:31Z

$DMYI 

DMYI is one of the most interesting and attractive spac setups in a long time and these are the pros and cons in light of upcoming ticker change.

Pros:
- Only 2.5% redemption at the vote compared to an average of 60% or more redemptions on most recent spacs means most investors want to hold DMYI
- most pipes are locked up for 6 to 18 months means very little institutional selling that tanked most spacs post merger
- pre-merger runup to $13 which is a rarity with spacs these days prior to ticker change means there is high buying interest in this name
- 1st publicly traded quantum computing pure play means there is a scarcity value like KCAC/QS which ran to $140 and VTIQ/NKLA which ran to $90 as first movers

Cons:
- The overall market sentiment is really the only thing we can think of at the moment

All in all, we are highly bullish on DMYI with the only caveat being the overall market, but if you can survive the current market downturn/correction, then IONQ will do very well.,2021-09-28T22:32:33Z
