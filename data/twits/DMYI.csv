$DMYI Why I think $IONQ will pop after the merger tomorrow.

(1) Investors already know revenue is not the objective here. The objective is to further their Quantum Computing technology.

(2) World class partnership with the world‚Äôs 3 largest cloud services ($GOOG Cloud, $AMNZ AWS, $MSFT Azure) 

(3) The founders are the who‚Äôs who of Quantum computing (Jungsang Kim, Christopher Monroe) plus David Bacon the former lead Quantum scientist from $GOOG. 

(4) Quantum is the future and IONQ is the leader in the field ahead of $IBM $GOOG $HON. 

That‚Äôs my take. Let‚Äôs see if I ll will have to eat my words tomorrow and the weeks after. 

Just my opinion. The deepest understand I have about Quantum technology is how to spell the world Quantum üòÇü§£,2021-09-27T22:46:04Z
$DMYI I wonder if we&#39;ll get the $IONQ board here on October first,2021-09-27T22:40:12Z

$DMYI DMYI will raise 600 million from this merger to IONQ...the market cap of DMYI is only 447 million right now...meaning their cash on hand will be 30% higher than their market cap!! We should see rockets this coming week once the deal goes through. We‚Äôve been having great volume and should only get better after mergere especially with big time investors money being locked up for 6 months post merger,2021-09-27T21:11:12Z
