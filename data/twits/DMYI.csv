$DMYI this is easy money. Look at all the investor for IonQ( Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Samsung..) and more. You would be dumb not to invest in these guys.,2021-09-06T16:54:00Z
$DMYI new here, doing my DD. Can you share a good article about the incoming merger?,2021-09-06T05:54:50Z

$DMYI 

And look at that media announcement. https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-254201/

Mr. Chapman from IONQ compares its company to NVIDIA and the journalist asks:

&quot;who wouldn‚Äôt have wanted to get into Nvidia at a $1.4 billion valuation?&quot;

IONQ&#39;s CEO sees in the future three modes of computation:

CPU‚Äôs, GPU‚Äôs, and QPU‚Äôs. (quantum processor units)

And remember, NVDA invented GPU and its stock was a multi-bagger.

So do not listen to any of those potential &quot;paid bashers&quot; who want the SP to fall.

And if they brought FUD to your mind, take a look on that source:

https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-217476/ p. 21

and remember:

&quot;I know some people feel like this is a million years away, but it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs here, it‚Äôs now. Quantum is going to be the new standard&quot;

IT&#39;S HERE, IT&#39;S NOW!,2021-09-05T19:44:49Z
$DMYI Freeder, self-claimed financial strategist, continues his ugly propaganda  on other board, saying that SP of DMYI/IONQ isn&#39;t cheap and suggesting you shouldn&#39;t buy it.

Lets&#39;s take a look on IONQ&#39;s valuation.

IONQ estimates  only ca. 500M of revenue in 2026 - 5 Y from now. So given 2B market cap, it has forward P/S (2026) of ca. 4.

LAZR last year has forward 5Y P/S of 20 (16B valuation in the peak vs. ca. 800M rev. in 2025).

TLRY was worth in the peak in 2018 more than 27B and now it has 1.35B estimate of revenue in 2023 (after merger with Aphria), which gives 5Y P/S of 20 at the peak.

SNOW estimates revenue of 10B in 2029, so it has 8Y P/S of 9.3 (IONQ 5Y P/S is ONLY 4!)

And now discounting. Almost all apply 20% discount rate for SPACs. Thus,  PV of IONQ&#39;s 500M rev. in 2026 is like 200M today. So it&#39;s like current P/S of 10. 

and...

Currently NVDA&#39;s trailing P/S is 26, MNDY 75, SNOW 110. 

So is IONQ&#39;s SP really expensive? Shall it have lower forward P/S than others?,2021-09-05T19:14:58Z

$DMYI You retail investors buy shares of garbage companies from crypto-mining and one-day low floaters rising 200-300% in a single day - regardless of their share price, but don&#39;t buy shares of real revolutionary quantum computer leader with such an enormous growth prospects? Shame on you!,2021-09-02T19:24:16Z
