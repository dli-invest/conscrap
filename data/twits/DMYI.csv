$DMYI EXCLUSIVE: IonQ CEO Talks Partnerships With Google, Amazon, Microsoft.  Investors and partners in IonQ include Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and more. The fact that the company&#39;s competition has partnered with or invested in IonQ is an indication of where it stands in the quantum ecosystem, Chapman said: &quot;we are that far ahead.&quot;

$DMYI really interested to see price action after merger here. could go either way,2021-07-22T19:24:20Z

$DMYI  What will the new symbol be after the merger?,2021-07-22T16:57:00Z
$DMYI Welcome Benzingaers.,2021-07-22T15:14:54Z
$DMYI Let&#39;s see who works for $QUBT. It was &quot;fouded&quot; by someone who didn&#39;t even work in the industry. Their CTO comes from D-Wave, which isn&#39;t even a real QC. His most noteworthy thing seems to be that he is old, which gives im &quot;experience&quot;. IonQ on the other side was founded by the father of Ion-Trap computing. IonQ has the who is who on their payroll. Atleast half of the leadership team has their own Wikipedia page and is a pioneer in the field.,2021-07-22T14:24:31Z
$DMYI Does anyone know what the market cap is going to be post merger?,2021-07-22T14:16:05Z
$DMYI IonQ on the other side has 8 papers in Nature. 3 in Nature Communications and a total of 18 Journal Articles. I&#39;m not counting the unpublished once.,2021-07-22T14:10:40Z
$DMYI Now let&#39;s look at their publications: I think the only thing that $QUBT has going for them is one paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11294.pdf  
This paper didn&#39;t even get published in a journal yet.,2021-07-22T14:08:16Z
$DMYI IonQ has the all part 2:,2021-07-22T14:04:02Z
$DMYI IonQ has them all:,2021-07-22T14:03:17Z
$DMYI Ok guys, since the $QUBT gang is polluting my beloved $DMYI ticker with their trash, I will run a comparison between a trash company that has &quot;quantum&quot; in their name and IonQ, the leader in quantum computing. Feel free to fight me.,2021-07-22T13:58:56Z
$DMYI I saw many stocks up 10-40% after the benzinga power hours. But it will be less for the SPACs, maybe 4% to 15% increase,2021-07-22T13:57:17Z
$DMYI let‚Äôs wait for the Benzinga Power Hour. It should bring a lot of volumes.,2021-07-22T13:35:16Z
@cheesedonkey what do you think about $DMYI,2021-07-22T13:11:44Z
$CENHU  there will be multiple opportunities in quantum computing from hardware to software technology companies. At present investing is a bit like taking the VC approach therefore having a basket of companies may be good. Certainly $CENHU and $DMYI are good plays as is $QUBT. No pumping just my thoughts. It would be good if D-wave go public as well since they take a slightly different approach to quantum computing. Do your DD and good luck to all, it may be a long haul but will be worth it in the end.,2021-07-22T12:59:09Z

$DMYI $QUBT bet these trade alongside each other until QC starts to separate from the masses‚Ä¶ either way they are both a gold mine.,2021-07-22T03:27:03Z
$DMYI We commence coverage soon as part of our work on quantum computing.  Our first note out likely Thursday or Friday - we&#39;ll post here once it&#39;s live.  (Disclosure, long DMYI).,2021-07-22T01:21:29Z
$DMYI this is one of the most slept on and amazing opportunities in the stock market right now and only being punished because of spac sentiment. the valuation is high but the potential is astronomical. I have one more potential quantum play up my sleeve but I&#39;m not telling anyone else until I&#39;ve fully loaded the boat.,2021-07-21T18:57:18Z
$DMYI Before I get ripped I&#39;m long warrants and shares. Does anyone think this will trade further below NAV after merger?,2021-07-21T18:37:46Z
$DMYI @disruptorinvesting what do you think about this long long term play in the quantum space?,2021-07-21T18:16:17Z
$QUBT  IonQ ( $DMYI ) values the quantum comp mkt at $65 billion by 2030. If there is competition there still appears to be room to grow but I still do not see a $QUBT  product that is in direct competition with ANY MAJOR or IONQ. This is an APP co vs SmartPhone argument and the smartphone makers are IonQ and the majors. ONCE AGAIN, this isn&#39;t a choice between IonQ and 
$QUBT. If you want to invest in this space you should own a basket that includes both along with at least Google (who is the obvious leader) and some of the other big tech names fighting for leadership. I&#39;m anxious to see a few more small/mid cap entries to add to the basket.,2021-07-21T17:13:40Z
$DMYI we might see $11 after the benzinga power hour,2021-07-21T14:05:36Z
$DMYI,2021-07-21T12:31:14Z
$DMYI The accumulation in the warrants is like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen in the SPAC space... Probably got at least a a thousand hours parked on SPAC  lvl 2s since DraftKings. Warrants are 30%+ higher than they &quot;should&quot; be. When what should doesn&#39;t, ask why. Arbing commons vs warrants is a very solid play. I honestly think it&#39;s some big VC adjacent money or maybe a dumb PM who is new to the SPAC space and is pricing warrants purely through the option pricing model without accounting from the SPAC warrant discount from redemption and deal fail risk. I&#39;d just long the f out of the commons though... Although there is a great covered call type play available...,2021-07-21T01:10:48Z
So, here&#39;s a summary of our views on quantum.  We&#39;ve spoken to the $QUBT CEO Robert Liscouski a couple times &amp; also to the head of $AMZN AWS Braket , Robert Moulds.  We think quantum computing holds a whole lot of promise because it can in principle solve certain kinds of mathematical problems faster than binary machines.  The technology is very, very early stage &amp; it is unclear whether either tech or commercial advantage will materialize at scale.  It might, it might not, it&#39;s just too early to say.  It is however in our view a prime time in high end computing for a paradigm shift.  The last couple decades have been characterized by x86 and Linux making inroads into the datacenter, which has certainly lowered costs, but cost alone isn&#39;t a paradigm shift.    We&#39;re excited about quantum and own suitably modest allocations in both QUBT and DMYI.

$TDAC Just out of curiosity, why are TDAC warrants trading at $2.50 when the stock is at $13, but then other SOAC warrants are much higher at the same commons level? $GHVI warrants are $5.10, commons at $13.30, $DMYI warrants are $3.10, commons are at $9.95. Seems like a common occurrence for others to have more expensive warrants than TDAC, despite their commons being cheaper than ours,2021-07-20T20:12:17Z
