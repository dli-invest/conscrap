$DMYI whens merge date?,2021-09-17T23:57:06Z
$DMYI This is looking juicy. It has the potential to be an explosive deSPAC. SRNG &gt;&gt; DNA did very well today and it has 3x the maximum initial float here + an immediately registered PIPE which should have been a headwind. 

Since the DMYI strategic PIPE investors have a rare 6-12 month PIPE lock-up, the headwinds from PIPE shorting may be minimal. 

I&#39;m long and strong! The future is quantum!,2021-09-17T22:25:52Z
