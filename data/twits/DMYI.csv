I floated the idea for my work to look into the IONQ research credits, it sounds like they are taking it seriously. We have reached out to our local university for additional guidance and support. I will keep you all updated if we actually pull this off! Short time frame to put a proposal together,2021-06-02T17:51:29Z

$DMYI Iâ€™m just under 6% with this and thatâ€™s my limit...saving my last allowance in case this drops hard I will add more then...otherwise Iâ€™m coasting for the next 3-5 and when my portfolio total allows Iâ€™ll add more while I can for 6%,2021-06-02T00:15:59Z
