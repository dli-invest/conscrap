$DMYI if the narrative for this pump is short squeeze, it&#39;s much worse price wise than if the narrative is just focused on the strong fundamentals of the company and their strong position within the market,2021-09-26T02:04:09Z
$AEHR, $DMYI and $CRCT are the top gainers for the day. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/stock-screener?v=3&amp;f=sl_pt_4_X,p_pg10,v1_50b500,exch_us&amp;s=pt&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=screener&amp;utm_content=Stock_Screener:_top_gainers&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2021-09-26T01:33:00Z
$DMYI Been here for a while and invested in most of de Masi SPACs 1-2-3 and considering 4. Lots of doubt in the past months holding SPACs that didn‚Äôt move, but here we are again, held through difficulties and seems like they have taken a different course from last month.  It is a relief and really shakes away the doubts.  
With the last spike, just before merger, and how other Quantum players have moved I am confident we won‚Äôt go to $5-6, though always trade responsibly, but we will get a huge spike. This sector is hot and with low float available we might spike really high. This will be 3 bagger soon. Enjoy the ride and GL.,2021-09-26T01:09:30Z

$DMYI would love some feed back on feeling about (holding) through the merger. Thanks peeps ‚úåÔ∏è.,2021-09-25T17:49:37Z
$DMYI ‚ÄúSo far, the company has raised $82 million and it‚Äôs no surprise that Amazon is one of IonQ‚Äôs primary backers. Then again, so are a few other companies with interest in massive-scale optimization for transport, manufacturing, and defense (Lockheed Martin, for instance).‚Äù 

Remember Peter Chapman IonQ ceo left Amazon as chief engineer of prime

$DMYI people say this could be a 10 bagger in a few years. IMO it can 10 bag based on projections well before it is profitable. I would not be surprised if it happens in Year One. The potential profits are quite massive, and that will drive the SP.,2021-09-25T16:21:06Z
