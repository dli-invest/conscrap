$DMYI The accumulation in the warrants is like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen in the SPAC space... Probably got at least a a thousand hours parked on SPAC  lvl 2s since DraftKings. Warrants are 30%+ higher than they &quot;should&quot; be. When what should doesn&#39;t, ask why. Arbing commons vs warrants is a very solid play. I honestly think it&#39;s some big VC adjacent money or maybe a dumb PM who is new to the SPAC space and is pricing warrants purely through the option pricing model without accounting from the SPAC warrant discount from redemption and deal fail risk. I&#39;d just long the f out of the commons though... Although there is a great covered call type play available...,2021-07-21T01:10:48Z
So, here&#39;s a summary of our views on quantum.  We&#39;ve spoken to the $QUBT CEO Robert Liscouski a couple times &amp; also to the head of $AMZN AWS Braket , Robert Moulds.  We think quantum computing holds a whole lot of promise because it can in principle solve certain kinds of mathematical problems faster than binary machines.  The technology is very, very early stage &amp; it is unclear whether either tech or commercial advantage will materialize at scale.  It might, it might not, it&#39;s just too early to say.  It is however in our view a prime time in high end computing for a paradigm shift.  The last couple decades have been characterized by x86 and Linux making inroads into the datacenter, which has certainly lowered costs, but cost alone isn&#39;t a paradigm shift.    We&#39;re excited about quantum and own suitably modest allocations in both QUBT and DMYI.  You can read more from us on quantum here - https://newsletter.cestriancapitalresearch.com/issues/wait-even-computers-have-alternative-facts-now-cestrian-stocks-bulletin-17-620268 (Disclosure, long QUBT and long $DMYI).,2021-07-20T21:28:03Z
$TDAC Just out of curiosity, why are TDAC warrants trading at $2.50 when the stock is at $13, but then other SOAC warrants are much higher at the same commons level? $GHVI warrants are $5.10, commons at $13.30, $DMYI warrants are $3.10, commons are at $9.95. Seems like a common occurrence for others to have more expensive warrants than TDAC, despite their commons being cheaper than ours,2021-07-20T20:12:17Z
$QUBT $DMYI is a better play is this space. It is merging with ion q,2021-07-20T18:42:48Z
$DMYI Here&#39;s the DA for dmyi turning into IONQ.

New Market cap will be 2 billion

$QUBT Diamond hands. This may be all over the place for some time but, unless the larger market tanks, the trend should be up. Quantum technology is a game changer and $QUBT is an early mover in the space. It is not competing with Big Tech... It is a complimentary play on the space - just like IonQ ( $DMYI  which I also own) has an alliance with Google, QUBT has an alliance with AWS. Ask yourself where IonQ and QUBT will be in 2 years, 5 years, 10 years? My guess is a multi-B market cap and/or bought out by one of the majors.,2021-07-20T17:58:04Z
$DMYI The question isn&#39;t &quot;is quantum a big deal&quot; it&#39;s what is this company worth.,2021-07-20T17:45:35Z

$DMYI cyber war will be the future. IONQ is a USA company. If USA  want to win a quantum cyber war in the future, they will need IONQ.,2021-07-20T14:36:07Z
$DMYI @Crysoonee I just donâ€™t understand how can some spac surge 100% before the merge. Itâ€™s totally a fever. Iâ€™m a physician. IONQ had great potential from my opinion. Donâ€™t know too much about other SPAC.,2021-07-20T14:29:04Z
$DMYI 
I&#39;m being cautious here. I think the SPAC fever has finally sizzled. Taking a small position now but waiting to see what happens post merger.  $talk and $dm got slaughtered after their mergers . . .,2021-07-20T14:21:47Z
$DMYI broke 10$  im loading.. that fucking merger better happen,2021-07-20T14:05:45Z
$DMYI the merge should be announced this week.,2021-07-20T14:03:23Z
$DMYI $9.95 looks like the bottom. Loaded 19k shares. Letâ€™s wait for the news,2021-07-20T13:54:16Z
$DMYI Back in 2000 shares @ 10.01 avg. Should see movement to mid 10&#39;s again for a nice little profit during some market volatility.,2021-07-20T01:57:22Z
$DMYI how can I buy a quantum computer?,2021-07-20T00:43:07Z
$DMYI merger date?,2021-07-19T19:46:14Z
$DMYI donâ€™t buy it at $9.98. Buy it at $9.88. It will drop more. Weak hands are getting weaker,2021-07-19T16:53:39Z
$DMYI we might see $9.88 again today, but itâ€™s ok,2021-07-19T12:17:23Z
$DMYI Merger date announcement soon.,2021-07-19T09:00:23Z
$QUBT the spac RAM is targeting quantum computing as well as Blockchain and AI. would be interesting if they picked up another great quantum computing company like $DMYI  did. warrants at 79 cents. RAMMW,2021-07-19T08:13:28Z
