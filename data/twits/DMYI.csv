$DMYI is gonna be like $NVDA and will get mass adoption,2021-05-04T19:17:35Z
$DMYI $ASTS $DPLS $RSI $HZON + diversification, these my largest holdingsâ€¦ In a couple years from now the disruptive capability of these in their respective areas is going to be fun to watch! GLTA,2021-05-04T16:56:33Z
$ASTS $AACQ $DMYI $HTOO I like it when my entire portofolio crashes into oblivion so I know it&#39;s not the companies I chose but something else. Still hurts though.,2021-05-04T14:51:26Z

$DMYI institutional ownership up 0.15% from 11.77% to 11.92%,2021-05-03T21:36:48Z
$DMYI short float up 0.16% from 0.51% to 0.67%,2021-05-03T21:36:47Z
$DMYI I find it odd this barely moves. My average is under 10.25 but Iâ€™m surprised it hasnâ€™t gone much lower yet. ðŸ¤” been tying up funds with low buy orders that wonâ€™t fill even on down market days.,2021-05-03T15:22:42Z

$ARKX Everybody knows that you can&#39;t calculate the jump to hyperspace without a quantum navi-computer. ARK doesn&#39;t know what it&#39;s doing. $DMYI,2021-05-01T01:10:52Z

$DMYI ok yeah I admit it, I can&#39;t help myself from accumulating more. Bought warrants for some other positions so I can plow more cash into IonQ commons :) got 100 more shares. Love it.,2021-04-30T15:23:53Z

$DMYI Just dropping by to say hi IonQ Fam! I&#39;M STILL HERE. 

I haven&#39;t sold, and never will, because that&#39;s just plain stupid. 

Been more focused on crypto plays as of recent, because stonks (SPACs ESPECIALLY!) haven&#39;t had the same kind of movement they did last year and crypto has been BOOMING. Always good to remember though that when the hype isn&#39;t around yet, that&#39;s likely the best time to buy and accumulate. This is supposedly what &#39;Smart Money&#39; does. 

Speaking of crypto, just imagine if (and when) IonQ starts renting out computational power to blockchain miners... the profitability and possibilities of this company could be endless, and we may just be incredibly early to one of the most revolutionary parties. 

Onwards and upwards my friends.,2021-04-29T04:49:50Z

$DMYI How&#39;s my sleeping giant doing? I&#39;ve got close to 1000 shares here. This will be like QS soon imo,2021-04-28T14:56:31Z
$DMYI just acquired 500 more. Sitting at 1k and long hold.,2021-04-27T21:09:13Z
$MSFT gotta get deeper into the quantum computing game with $DMYI to dominate the next wave of computing,2021-04-27T20:34:16Z
$DMYI If you want to pretend like you are teaching yourself how Quantum Computing works, download the IBM app Hello Quantum. Still have no clue what this stuff is,2021-04-27T15:57:45Z
