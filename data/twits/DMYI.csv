$DMYI 
Holding a small position of $dmyi but waiting till after merger to dive in. If this merger is anything like $dm or $talk there will be plenty of better times to jump in post merger,2021-08-12T00:24:48Z

$DMYI some brief DD on IonQ and the Quantum Computing industry, really interesting stuff.

$DMYI NAV buy-in is a good price for a great SPAC.,2021-08-10T18:23:28Z
$DMYI I bought $BNGO $SENS $GNPX when they had less than 10k watchers. This one will be big in the future.ðŸ˜Ž,2021-08-10T16:25:38Z

the only pureplay on this list is $dmyi and their merger with Ionq. a lot to be excited about! also I&#39;m looking for that Honeywell/ Cambridge pureplay to join them ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ $RAM

$DMYI At the moment we have IONQ that seems to have one of the most advanced processors, then we have the union of a software company and a hardware company that will be interesting, and maybe they will come out with the RAM SPAC. And then we have CENH which is specialized in quantum security, even, they say, against quantum computers. The issue of security is also very important. Three companies related to quantum computing. You have to bet on the leader, the alpha, and we still don&#39;t know which one it is, but CENH won&#39;t be because it is too specialized, although it can have enormous successes. I would especially like to invest in quantum hardware and operating systems (general, non-specialized software). IONQ for the moment is my favourite.,2021-08-09T20:33:32Z
I love that $ram mentions $cenh in the news section of their website. acknowledging a great quantum merger that is still under the radar. like cenh, I think ram will get a DA very fast. I think cenh was about a month after units split. it&#39;s been exactly a month since RAM units split and the Cambridge Quantum connections are juicy
