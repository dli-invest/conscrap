$DMYI Added some under $10 today. Still very low risk at least until the merger closes. Looking forward to more good news from IonQ. This stock will find love some day soon.,2021-05-11T16:14:05Z
$DMYI shares dipped under 10, warrants dipped under 2.  crazy market,2021-05-11T15:00:02Z
$DMYI I still believe 100% in IonQ. Nothing has changed at all. I would buy more but I&#39;m simply out of ammo. I will add if I can later, presuming we start trading sub NAV for a while.,2021-05-11T14:49:09Z
$DMYI really too bad I didn&#39;t have a crystal ball to load up at this price. Sigh.,2021-05-11T13:27:01Z

$DMYI pipe price?,2021-05-11T11:33:22Z
$DMYI Wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see this trade under $5 after the merger. The rising risk free rate will screw up all valuations, especially for growth tech companies. Be prepared to buy the dip and hold for years.,2021-05-10T22:41:22Z
$DMYI what‚Äôs the post merge valuation?,2021-05-09T10:00:31Z
$DMYI What we need is a second well known company to go public at a higher valuation. That will supercharge IonQ.,2021-05-09T02:20:35Z
$DMYI I‚Äôm here for a minimum 2 years after merger before considering pulling out.

$DMYI alright quantum computer fans that‚Äôs another week wrapped let‚Äôs go to the bar now,2021-05-07T19:59:05Z
$DMYI I‚Äôm so bullish on this company and keep buying the dip. Come on, do something. But should I sell my kidneys to buy more?,2021-05-07T19:58:17Z
$DMYI stubborn warrants,2021-05-07T19:52:02Z
