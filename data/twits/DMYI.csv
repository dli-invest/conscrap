$DMYI many I feel don&#39;t understand the significance of this technology and what it can achieve. In the short term it can easily do things like crypto mining with significantly less power with hugely faster speeds, pretty much unbreakable cyber security, banking, crypto, home security etc could all be massive clients. Longer term the sky is the limit, it could solve everything from EV fast charging and autopilot, through to unlocking the secrets of the universe and working directly with our brains, like an advanced nurolink.. ill be holding this for many years..,2021-05-18T20:29:36Z

$THCB $SOFI $DMYI $ABCL$FUBO @6FiguresBy2022 @Alexsunder you should better diversify your portfolio. There are a couple of stocks which will perform like Square, Okta or Trade desk in the future. You just have to be patient &amp; encouraged to buy and hold.  Biontech was a gift with this new technology, same could be ABcellara. Same could be Signify, Fubo TV, Sofi or IonQ,2021-05-15T11:24:50Z

Getting worried this will tank post merger.

Staying in SPACs for now as a cash store given the growth stock crash.

This will need some sort of catalyst to prevent post merger tank. That may come in the form as govt contract / funding or big contract with a company such a Palantir or Google.
