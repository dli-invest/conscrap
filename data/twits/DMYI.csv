Another great article:

The author tells us: &quot;No SPAC has a bigger market opportunity or potential upside&quot;. 

He also &quot;expects some very interesting trading opportunities&quot;.

So bashers, please do not put it in the same basket as some other SPACs which fell after merger.,2021-09-15T19:33:32Z

$DMYI warrants on this are pretty strong,2021-09-15T14:51:30Z
$DMYI I love this stock and excited for it to merge but was wondering if anyone has any other plays similar to this where itâ€™s not to known but could be a serious game changer in the future? Iâ€™m looking at VLTA and our other merger DMYQ,2021-09-15T12:38:51Z
$DMYI Only narrow-minded investors can say that IONQ fall (or even won&#39;t raise) after merger. 

This website tracks all SPACs:

https://www.spachero.com/commons/

As you can see, despite general bad sentiment toward them many deSPACs still trade with a big premium.

Out of total of 238 deSPACs, 105 (or 44%) trade above 10.
28 of them (12%) (including 2 recent ones) trade above 20. 

As for SPACs before completion of merger, the situation is quite different. Out of 128 SPACs who found their target, only 26 trade with premium and only 6 trade above 10.40!

Why? Simply because there have been too many of them and not all of them are that good; investors are tired of them, that&#39;s why they are generalizing their view about them. That&#39;s the reason why such a revolutionary companies like IONQ are under the radar as they say. But this will change just after completion of the merger. IMO there is no way that such a leading disruptive hyper-growth stocks as IONQ trades without remarkable premium.,2021-09-15T03:16:06Z

$DMYI Do you all think IonQ is about to claim quantum advantage? That would be the first time ever a quantum company claims a real business use for their quantum computer.,2021-09-13T20:25:19Z
$DMYI 
Does anyone know what the price set for warrants redemption for IONQ? for most spacs the company can redeem all warrants if sp is $18 or more during a 30 day period. For others, it is $12.,2021-09-13T18:11:07Z
