Dear Investors and Gamblers

I would like to share with you statistics - a comparison of current market cap (MC) of some disruptive stocks (which are perceived to be leaders) with market of their products in 2030 (the most optimistic estimates I found).

1. NTLA, MC 10.8B vs. 36.1B gene editing m., 

s: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/genome-editing-market-size-hit-125000048.html

2. QS, MC 8.1B vs. 10B next gen. batteries m.,

s: https://www.luxresearchinc.com/press-releases/next-generation-batteries-beyond-li-ion-will-be-worth-10-billion-in-2030

3. SPCE, market cap 6.3B, vs. 7.9B Space Tourism &amp; Travel M., 

s: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/05/2153057/0/en/NSR-Space-Tourism-Travel-Market-to-Generate-7-9-B-Projecting-to-Fly-41-000-Passengers-by-2030.html

4. LAZR, MC 5.5B vs. 13.9B Automotive LiDAR m.

s: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/automotive-lidar-sensor-market-opportunities-and-forecast-2019-2030-301003874.html

5. JOBY, current MC ca. 5B vs. 15.2B UAM m.

s.: https://www.urbanairmobilitynews.com/market-analysis/uam-market-will-hit-usd15-2bn-by-2030-research/

And now take a look on QC market estimate - 65B in 2030 (s: https://aithority.com/computing/quantum-computing-market-is-poised-to-surpass-64988-3-million-by-2030-ps-intelligence/).

Please compare its with current implied MC for $DMYI (IONQ), which is ca. 2B. As you can see, current MC of $DMYI (IONQ) is only 3% of its market estimate in 2030.

So maybe now you stop spreading such fantasies that $DMYI  (IONQ) will drop to 7-8 after merger? :D,2021-08-19T20:02:00Z
$DMYI will reach 20* soon,2021-08-17T22:17:42Z
