EXCERPT:

Although not an exhaustive list, the PIPE investors include some of the biggest investors in the world: Breakthrough Energy (Bill Gates), TIME Ventures (Marc Benioff), MSD Capital, Silver Lake Partners, Fidelity and Hyundai. Existing investors include but are not limited to Amazon Web Services, Bosch, Samsung Ventures, Tao Capital, Lockheed Martin LMT +0.3%, Airbus Ventures and HPE Ventures.

Currently, the business‚Äôs quantum service is the only one available on both AWS and Azure and once merged, they will end up being the most well-funded standalone quantum business.

... the trapped-ion method comes from nature and builds quantum qubits on a small chip (Honeywell, who also realized the power of quantum, is also using an ion method).

$DMYI Niccolo De Masi suggests that IonQ will be part of the quantum oligopoly, and I think that&#39;s accurate.  There will be room for several quantum players and options in just a couple of years as the big companies are evolving even as IonQ is ahead at the moment. Honeywell, from what I can tell, is trying to keep up but is pretty far behind IonQ. 

I can&#39;t invest bulk funds, so I&#39;m grateful this continues sideways so that I can buy at regular paycheck intervals and accumulate. This one is patience &amp; continued research to maintain assurance as the field evolves. So far, the research keeps saying IonQ is üî• üî•üî•

$DMYI crypto is just soaking up all the retail liquidity right now. This and many small caps and other quality spacs will just sit around for a while until tutes move in and or we get major news. It will be a dry and boring summer. Set it and forget it basically.,2021-05-06T15:00:42Z

I didn‚Äôt read this in detail yet, but from the surface it seems biased towards IBM. It seems like IONQ was left out of some of the tests? But perhaps there was a reason behind it if I took the time to read. It does look like positive news for Ionq
