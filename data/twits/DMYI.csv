$850 billion by 2040 üòÉ

‚ÄúRecent advances and roadmaps from major hardware companies such IBM, Google, Honeywell, IonQ, PsiQuantum and others have increased the confidence that we will have machines powerful enough to tackle important business and society problems before the end of this decade. Impacted companies and governments should get prepared for an accelerated timeline,‚Äù says Bobier.

This upturn in investment is driven by major advances in quantum computing technology and predictions of massive performance and profit improvements as a result of this new capability. The BCG research estimates that quantum computing will unlock new value across many industries, creating up to $850-billion in annual value by 2040.

That ticker turn is imminent:

Investors and partners in IonQ include Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) and more. The fact that the company&#39;s competition has partnered with or invested in IonQ is an indication of where it stands in the quantum ecosystem, Chapman said: &quot;we are that far ahead.&quot;

$DMYI Our note on this one out later.  The company has the best early stage investor presentation we have seen in a very long time.  (https://www.dmytechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IonQ-Management-Presentation.pdf).  Now, that just means they know how to do great capital markets marketing, it doesn&#39;t mean anything about reality, but such marketing is an essential skill for public companies so they are set up for success in that regard at least.  (Disclosure, long DMYI).,2021-07-23T09:47:16Z
$DMYI This could justifiably trade anywhere between $4 and $40 this year. One thing it has on its side is the early price targets.,2021-07-23T08:37:17Z

$DMYI Welcome Benzingaers.,2021-07-22T15:14:54Z
$DMYI Let&#39;s see who works for $QUBT. It was &quot;fouded&quot; by someone who didn&#39;t even work in the industry. Their CTO comes from D-Wave, which isn&#39;t even a real QC. His most noteworthy thing seems to be that he is old, which gives im &quot;experience&quot;. IonQ on the other side was founded by the father of Ion-Trap computing. IonQ has the who is who on their payroll. Atleast half of the leadership team has their own Wikipedia page and is a pioneer in the field.,2021-07-22T14:24:31Z
$DMYI Does anyone know what the market cap is going to be post merger?,2021-07-22T14:16:05Z
$DMYI IonQ on the other side has 8 papers in Nature. 3 in Nature Communications and a total of 18 Journal Articles. I&#39;m not counting the unpublished once.,2021-07-22T14:10:40Z
$DMYI Now let&#39;s look at their publications: I think the only thing that $QUBT has going for them is one paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11294.pdf  
This paper didn&#39;t even get published in a journal yet.,2021-07-22T14:08:16Z
