$DMYI Back in 2000 shares @ 10.01 avg. Should see movement to mid 10&#39;s again for a nice little profit during some market volatility.,2021-07-20T01:57:22Z
$DMYI how can I buy a quantum computer?,2021-07-20T00:43:07Z
$DMYI merger date?,2021-07-19T19:46:14Z
$DMYI donâ€™t buy it at $9.98. Buy it at $9.88. It will drop more. Weak hands are getting weaker,2021-07-19T16:53:39Z
$DMYI we might see $9.88 again today, but itâ€™s ok,2021-07-19T12:17:23Z
$DMYI Merger date announcement soon.,2021-07-19T09:00:23Z
$QUBT the spac RAM is targeting quantum computing as well as Blockchain and AI. would be interesting if they picked up another great quantum computing company like $DMYI  did. warrants at 79 cents. RAMMW,2021-07-19T08:13:28Z
$DMYI take your time. its cool,2021-07-19T05:02:15Z

$DMYI I think weâ€™re going sub $10 today. Market is bloody red,2021-07-16T18:48:34Z
$DMYI weâ€™re green!  For once,2021-07-16T18:43:08Z
Well the good news is $DMYI has bounced back from yesterdays blood bath.,2021-07-16T18:12:09Z
$DMYI chexk out Ram. warrants are rammw and at .79 cents. quantum computing is one of the sectors they&#39;re targeting as well as Blockchain, aerospace, and AI. would be cool if they snagged one of ionq&#39;s competitors. ionq looks to be on top but warrants at 79 cents are pretty sweet,2021-07-16T16:36:42Z
$DMYI itâ€™s ok for us to see $10 or even $9.8. It might bounce next month. Might stay low this month,2021-07-16T16:24:13Z
$DMYI Peter said we start to vote next month,2021-07-16T14:29:28Z

$DMYI we might start merge next month!!,2021-07-16T14:25:36Z
$DMYI buy and hold for 10 years. As much as you can afford. Simple as that. If we go down sub 10 after de-spac, buy more shares at the fire sale prices. If you get 1000+ shares you will become a millionaire in time.,2021-07-15T17:43:52Z
$QUBT If I were trading this it would only be around a base position.  I own this and a basket of other plays on the growth of quantum tech. There are very few names. Primary names are large cap co&#39;s like $GOOGL , $IBM , and $NVDA . Smallcaps are $DMYI and $QUBT . I will hold these co&#39;s for years in a basket. If anyone knows any other smallcap quantum plays please advise?,2021-07-15T17:40:43Z
