$DMYI problem with spacs now is that an arbitrage will happen at merger. Be wise. Love the concept and the story, sold months back will be back post merger.,2021-08-02T19:31:46Z
$DMYI   Whats up with the Warrants?  Stock is up .05 and the warrants down .11 .  What the heck?,2021-08-02T18:32:22Z
$DMYI Can someone please tell me if DMYI and DMYI.U is the same? i see that on the IONQ website that it is merging with DMYI.U. I also see that DMYI.U is at $10.67 and DMYI is at $9.92. If I invested in DMYI, did I invest into the wrong one if I wanted to get in on IONQ? Thank you for your answer.,2021-07-31T16:44:19Z

$DMYI  We just need patient, this is not a short term investment.  It will pay off in the long term, but little by little the shares will become more expensive. Like all highly successful companies, suddenly, one year, it will rise to the skies and it will be more than late to buy it cheaply. You could wait several years and buy then? Just double it once, you divide its potential in half. If you think that it will multiply its price 20 times, and you buy late once the price has already doubled, its potential will only be 10 times more. This is the important thing, buy now, as cheaply as possible to OPTIMIZE the multiple potential. I have learnt this by observing with detail the charts of the most successful companies.,2021-07-30T13:59:17Z

$DMYI what I said was wrong. IONQ is so much better than Nikola. Nikola is a scam, but this company has great potential. The stock price will at least up10% after they announce the merge. Quantum computer will play a important role in most fields, for example biotech, energy, machine learning .,2021-07-29T23:54:41Z

$RAM Dan Tapiero&#39;s 10T fund led the series C funding for Ledger. Dan is a director for RAM.  the CEO of RAM, Thane Ritchie, is  also an early investor in Ledger. their spac is targeting crypto and Blockchain technology. this is my second guess for RAM after Honeywell/Cambridge Quantum computing spin-off. so many connections. this team is going to land something really good.

$QUBT Can someone explain the potential future market cap here or potential future revenues? The TAM for quantum is hard to quantify at this point in time since we are so early. Is splitting 50-50 between DMYI and QUBT the move at this point? $DMYI,2021-07-27T21:39:56Z
