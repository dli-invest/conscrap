&quot;But again, at that time. There&#39;s some good news from Honeywell&#39;s perspective, in that the company has added more qubits without increasing the error rate, bringing itself up to a quantum volume of 512. By comparison, IBM only reached Honeywell&#39;s earlier mark of 64 this past summer using a machine with 27 qubits but a higher rate of errors.
But there&#39;s also the other ion trap computing company, IonQ. Previously, it had been in a similar place to IBM: more qubits, but more errors. However, it managed to roughly triple the qubit count at the same time that it raised its qubit quality to be comparable to Honeywell&#39;s. With low errors and the large boost in qubit count, its quantum volume comes in at over 4 million, which is quite a bit higher than 512. And while it took about a year for Honeywell to add two qubits, at the time of its announcement, IonQ said it expects to double its qubit number to 64 within eight months‚Äîwhich is now less than three months away.&quot;

313369900,$DMYI &quot;Investor interest in the field has been growing. Maryland-based IonQ, founded by the physicists Chris Monroe and Jungsang Kim in 2015, has raised tens of millions of dollars from various investment funds ‚Äî most recently from Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the fund backed by Bill Gates that invests in technology related to clean energy.
Breakthrough Energy is interested in quantum computing as a tool for finding new materials to enable carbon sequestration, said Monroe, chief scientist at IonQ, which has announced plans to go public on the New York Stock Exchange.&quot; https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/07/duality-quantum-startup-accelerator/,2021-04-08T16:15:17Z
