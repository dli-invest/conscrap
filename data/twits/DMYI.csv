$DMYI ARQQ, which is clearly a minor company than IONQ, has been valued by the market above 4.5B recently. Therefore, I assume that IONQ will be valued at least 5B at some point. Maybe this year. So x2.5 SPAC price.,2021-09-26T20:52:50Z
$DMYI I think there are about 6-7 very serious companies trying to create quantum processors. To say that IONQ is the leader, as I have read in some places, is something tremendously risky. We will have to wait a few years to find out who is leading the race. Meanwhile, the few companies that are listed will have higher appreciation because it is the only way to invest for most. I foresee that in the next few years most of the mentioned companies will be listed on the stock market. But the starting prices will be much higher than 2B in market cap. Therefore, it is still a unique opportunity to invest in IONQ today, and may be the best ever.,2021-09-26T20:29:58Z
$DMYI has an average technical rating and it also does not offer a high quality setup at the moment. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/DMYI/technical-analysis?key=cf6913d4-13e8-4d19-8732-e2a2bc9a4ff3&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=TA&amp;utm_content=DMYI&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2021-09-26T20:22:00Z
