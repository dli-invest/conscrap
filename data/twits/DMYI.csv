the only pureplay on this list is $dmyi and their merger with Ionq. a lot to be excited about! also I&#39;m looking for that Honeywell/ Cambridge pureplay to join them üëÄüëÄüëÄ $RAM

$DMYI At the moment we have IONQ that seems to have one of the most advanced processors, then we have the union of a software company and a hardware company that will be interesting, and maybe they will come out with the RAM SPAC. And then we have CENH which is specialized in quantum security, even, they say, against quantum computers. The issue of security is also very important. Three companies related to quantum computing. You have to bet on the leader, the alpha, and we still don&#39;t know which one it is, but CENH won&#39;t be because it is too specialized, although it can have enormous successes. I would especially like to invest in quantum hardware and operating systems (general, non-specialized software). IONQ for the moment is my favourite.,2021-08-09T20:33:32Z
I love that $ram mentions $cenh in the news section of their website. acknowledging a great quantum merger that is still under the radar. like cenh, I think ram will get a DA very fast. I think cenh was about a month after units split. it&#39;s been exactly a month since RAM units split and the Cambridge Quantum connections are juicy

$RAM Thane Ritchie was an early investor in Cambridge Quantum. RAM just hired Chris Perry as an advisor. he was also an early investor in Cambridge Quantum and an advisor. their spac is targeting quantum computing. Honeywell Quantum and Cambridge Quantum are merging and have already stated they will be a pubic pure play company. no easier way to complete a merger than by using a spac.  warrants of $rammw are still under 80 cents. this is highway robbery and there are even enough clues here for Steve to figure this out already.
