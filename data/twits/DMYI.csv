$DMYI $VLKAF $GOOG LOAD UP!   &quot;For Volkswagen, running the ‚Äúpaint shop problem‚Äù is a useful benchmark because it is a sequential ordering challenge reflective of many of the industry problems they hope quantum computing will help address. Cirq is fast and simple to deploy, and Volkswagen found that running on IonQ via Cirq produced the same results as doing so via other quantum frameworks.

‚ÄúApplied quantum computing is still in its infancy, and the easier it becomes to access quantum computing hardware like IonQ‚Äôs via different tools, the broader and faster the adoption across many industries,‚Äù said Dr. Florian Neukart, Director, Volkswagen Data Lab. ‚ÄúThis will speed up the development of industry-relevant applications, which is also what we focus on at Volkswagen.‚Äùhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210610005267/en/IonQ-Adds-Integration-with-Google-Cirq-Making-IonQ%E2%80%99s-Leading-Systems-Operable-with-all-Major-Quantum-Software-Frameworks$v,2021-06-10T15:29:20Z
