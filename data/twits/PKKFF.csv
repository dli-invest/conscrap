$PKKFF I mean we all know what happens to a stock when it gets listed on NASDAQ it moons initially at least üòÇ

P.S the delay is because they couldn‚Äôt file the F40 to the sec without having Q2 results out. So, expect it on Tuesday or next week if all goes normal. Chill üòé‚úåÔ∏è,2021-09-03T03:50:19Z

$PKKFF A contemporary example of this process would be the case of Peak Fintech Group, a fast-growing tech firm based in Montreal, Canada. Peak first established a presence on the OTC markets to acquaint American investors with the company while it continued to grow and work toward meeting NASDAQ requirements. The company is now scheduled to complete its listing later this month and graduate to the NASDAQ.,2021-09-03T01:48:26Z

$PKKFF The biggest &quot;risks&quot; for us long term guys are going to be the potential for wild fluctuations in price. I can imagine a scenario where it eventually runs up to $25+ then gets caught up in broad based selling due to some new Chinese regulation that has nothing to do with TNT and we have to suffer watching the price retract to $15. We could see impressive ATH&#39;s followed by retractions that end up taking months to get back. We&#39;ve been gifted with an impressive run up. Steel yourself to a wild ride if you&#39;re in it for the long haul.,2021-09-02T22:41:08Z
$PKKFF ever since articyam came around we are up like 15%. I say we keep him around,2021-09-02T22:20:28Z
$PKKFF Can anyone tell me what the &#39;quiet period&#39; in 2017 was where peak lost about 65% of it&#39;s worth? It wasn&#39;t on my radar then.,2021-09-02T21:40:13Z
$PKKFF Peak continues to get stronger by the day - JJ is working his magic here while Golden is lighting it up in China! üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®,2021-09-02T21:04:13Z
$PKKFF because they didn‚Äôt post the F40 today means they will do it tomorrow! monday is market closing and Tuesday it will open with TNT tickerüöÄüöÄ,2021-09-02T20:51:19Z
$PKKFF Take me off the ledge or push me forward. I will exercise some of my company options so I can prep to add to Peak.

Tell me I am crazy, or not?

$PKKFF PKK has been green something like 17 of the last 20 trading days. What a run. And we‚Äôre just getting started. :),2021-09-02T20:37:27Z
$PKKFF this is all quite simple. Buy, hold, and accumulate as many shares as you can. The smart $ and investors know where this is headed. $UPST is ahead of us and is a terrific company, but our time is coming as a B2B Fintech that dominates in China and soon North America and more!,2021-09-02T20:19:58Z
$PKKFF Wonder about those sitting in the middle of the road,  while asking passive aggressive questions and watching the $$$ pass them by.  Does anyone know the benefit of that?  Is the time spent beneficial, considering zero intent of  an investment?  I can&#39;t seem to find the answer on google anywhere.  Seems super sketchy. But hey what do I know.,2021-09-02T20:16:17Z

$PKKFF Interesting to see the track record of this guy who  is a strategic advisor to Peak. 

https://sheldoninwentash.com/

Does anyone have any information on him? 
I seem to only find sketchy information. 

Seems like all the companies he&#39;s been connected with have &#39;peaked&#39;.,2021-09-02T19:50:52Z
$PKKFF Any news about the Nasdaq listing?

I thought it was supposed to be end of August?,2021-09-02T18:32:26Z
$PKKFF: not according to TD Ameritrade.  And at any rate not a big enough diff to support your thesis about size of diff in Mc between two.  Would say almost equal in shares os,2021-09-02T18:30:31Z
$PKKFF Peak 81m shares OS, UPST 78m shares OS.

ramblin56 you took an F on this one,2021-09-02T17:39:20Z
$PKKFF Hi Jacob, 
  
The announcement may happen late this week or early next week. It&#39;s a very litigious process to be accepted in the USA market. The F40 is completed and is being filed this week, after which we can list the next day. Monday next week is a holiday here, so it might go to Tuesday, but it is coming soon.
