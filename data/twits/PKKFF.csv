$PKKFF 
See note 3 on the report I wrote: company should actually turn a profit in 2021. 
Full discloser I am an unlicensed financial advisor. I would strongly recommend to anyone who is not interested in eating a bag of dicks, load up now. Take cash advances on your credit cards, raid your kids college fund, sell your dog, shit sell your neighbors dog. Just don’t miss out on this. But if you do like eating bags of dicks, and or trying to panic people with standard legal disclaimers you should consider sitting this one out.,2021-05-09T23:36:33Z
$PKKFF See Note 2 on Grant Thornton&#39;s report:  The level of revenue currently being generated is not presently sufficient to meet the working capital requirements. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional financing. Even if the Company has been successful in the past in doing so, there is no assurance that it will manage to obtain additional financing in the future. Also, the Company incurred a net loss of $5,513,511 for the year ended December 31, 2020,  it has an accumulated deficit of $30,240,372 as at December 31, 2020 and it has not yet generated positive cash flows from operations on a regular basis. The company will continue to assess its working capital needs and undertake whatever initiatives it deems necessary to ensure that it continues to be in a position to meet its financial obligations. These material uncertainties cast significant doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern,2021-05-09T15:51:47Z

$PKKFF obviously just like most things online... you cannot believe everything that’s posted here.. some people are trying to drag this down for their advantage. Shameful,2021-05-07T15:51:00Z
$PKKFF Come on peanut❣️ I like the look of those earnings!,2021-05-07T14:14:34Z
Zacks Investment Research Sets Peak Fintech Group Q1 2021 Earnings Estimates at ($0.02) EPS. https://www.marketbeat.com/x/1036501 $PKKFF,2021-05-07T13:57:58Z
$PKKFF this is ugly,2021-05-07T13:43:39Z
$PKKFF  pre market glitch he he,2021-05-07T13:23:19Z
$PKKFF ouch, going back to bed,2021-05-07T12:49:23Z
$PKKFF euh... doesn&#39;t look good to start the day,2021-05-07T12:06:58Z
$PKKFF I&#39;m glad we are getting the market shit show over with now while it is quiet. I&#39;ve been looking around and even the big fish are down at the moment. I&#39;ve seen big news even and they still down  lol

 Rather start the up trend after the bulk of this volatility settles down....,2021-05-07T08:27:26Z
$PKKFF Whole otc has been upside down last 3 months,dealing with this much red I’ll definitely have earned my bread,2021-05-06T23:27:26Z
$PKKFF   I guess if I dumped everything I had on this stock on day one and expected to get rich on day two I’d be pissed and whining like some of you.   I didn’t! Yeh for me. I don’t mind getting rich slow.  Buy the dip on this one and quit bitchin’. You sound like spoiled little  fourth graders.,2021-05-06T20:25:15Z
$PKKFF All those bitching about a dip in this stock should just sell and move on. Take your negativity with you.,2021-05-06T20:20:10Z
$PKKFF dang this is the most negativity I&#39;ve seen from this board in a while. Must mean we&#39;re getting close to good news?,2021-05-06T18:36:33Z
$PKKFF where is the 100M revenue? This is seeming more and more like hot garbage everyday. Echo chamber on the twits board. all the symptoms of a front runner. Starting to scale out. bye bye. you can&#39;t steal from me at that 1.20 gap. This will reverse split and they will spin more and more fud.

Happy to be proven wrong. But this thing is starting to get that stank to it. But hey what do I know. I&#39;ve only done this for a decade. lol,2021-05-06T18:04:40Z
$PKKFF the r/s will kill this short term,2021-05-06T17:33:06Z
$PKKFF can’t really understand this panic!,2021-05-06T16:56:41Z
$PKKFF Check this out!  Sheldon Inwentash thinks Peak will be $50.  Personally I feel in a few years it will be much higher.

$PKKFF If you have done your DD and understand where we are, then buy the dip and JUST RELAX.  Peak’s future is bright… it will be worth the wait. 💎💰,2021-05-06T16:41:16Z
$PKKFF this one is a wrap. Another OTC with bad management,2021-05-06T16:15:12Z
$PKKFF still no guidance. wtf is JJ thinking.,2021-05-06T15:57:41Z
$PKKFF I sold my 21,000 shares because Q4 didn&#39;t satisfy me at all and there is still no guidance for 2021. There&#39;s not that much to look forward to unlike the last month where we all waited for the earnings. Did the same thing with $THCB which takes half a year to complete a fu*king merger and still isn&#39;t done...,2021-05-06T15:55:09Z
$PKKFF ,2021-05-06T15:22:41Z
$PKKFF My concern is being validated. Weakness in the broader market is pulling down Peak. It had good support at 2.28, which is now gone.,2021-05-06T15:15:06Z
$PKKFF uh...,2021-05-06T15:10:45Z
