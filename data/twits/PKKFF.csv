$PKKFF  if you&#39;re not excited with these quotes then you should just sell:

- JJ:  &quot;Expect more news on Unionpay in the next few weeks or so&quot;

- JJ:  &quot;Influencers are a force in China&quot;

- JJ:  &quot;we have funding now and what we&#39;ll be doing with these partners&quot;&quot;we have funding now and what we&#39;ll be doing with these partners&quot; (on Partnerships: Unionpay, JD.com, ShopEX...)

- JJ:  &quot;Lots of news coming in the next few weeks, the market/audience might be sick of hearing from us&quot;

- JJ:  &quot;Quiet for 3 months but through end of Sept, there will be news coming out every week , sometimes twice a week&quot;

- JJ:  &quot;Lots of things happening that we&#39;re very excited about and that we&#39;ll be sharing with the market soon&quot;,2021-07-15T21:49:51Z
$PKKFF 

- Sitting on 52mm of cash (You can&#39;t say this for many OTC stocks)
- Pending Guidance for 2021 and 2022 revenue on Tues, July 20th (Over $100mm+)
- Upcoming RS and Nasdaq listing by late August 2021 (only administrative work left) 
- Pending Cubeler purchase (de-risk)
- Peak to do business in Canada (Sept/Oct) and USA by end of this year

Peak is sitting at a market cap of $280mm with $42mm in revenue (7x sales). You can do your math to see what this is worth and where guidance will take us.   

Here&#39;s some info, with no other news and assuming $100mm revenue for 2021 (which we know will be more) then we should be sitting at $7.,2021-07-15T21:48:35Z

$PKKFF Liked the interview. Seems like a like an affable guy. The consolidation (reverse split)number will be announced next week, he slipped a bit and tried to correct himself but his first statement was in the next few days.,2021-07-15T20:14:04Z
$PKKFF This is 10% up in this bad day in the markets?,2021-07-15T19:51:33Z
$PKKFF  good update from JJ.  young guy who should really grow into his role.  
the busineess hub approach reminds me a bit of shopify.  wondering if there is synergy somehow?  finalizing nasdaq and then cubeler in that order will be huge catalysts. nasdaq brings street cred, cubeler brings business cred.  Nasdaq is key as that is regulatory controlled.  Cubeler transaction is arms length business deal. 

forecast will be interesting esp. any NA numbers I assume it will exclude NA.  

so undervalued against any growth multiple.   based on the rev projections JJ shares next week use 10-25 multiple to get MC.  if it gets rolling 25-40 multiple will be deserved with expectations to grow into valuation.  but thatâ€™s at least 1 year out.  need to see the quarterly sequential growth trends and then extrapolate

i will be interested to see over next month if the shares out on loan are covered.,2021-07-15T19:32:32Z
$PKKFF this is the best hidden gem stock out there Iâ€™m glad we all got to get in at its infancy hopefully Iâ€™ll see a lot of you guys here 3-5 years from now,2021-07-15T19:26:06Z
