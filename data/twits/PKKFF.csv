$PKKFF obviously just like most things online... you cannot believe everything that‚Äôs posted here.. some people are trying to drag this down for their advantage. Shameful,2021-05-07T15:51:00Z
$PKKFF Come on peanut‚ù£Ô∏è I like the look of those earnings!,2021-05-07T14:14:34Z
Zacks Investment Research Sets Peak Fintech Group Q1 2021 Earnings Estimates at ($0.02) EPS. https://www.marketbeat.com/x/1036501 $PKKFF,2021-05-07T13:57:58Z
$PKKFF this is ugly,2021-05-07T13:43:39Z
$PKKFF  pre market glitch he he,2021-05-07T13:23:19Z
$PKKFF ouch, going back to bed,2021-05-07T12:49:23Z
$PKKFF euh... doesn&#39;t look good to start the day,2021-05-07T12:06:58Z
$PKKFF I&#39;m glad we are getting the market shit show over with now while it is quiet. I&#39;ve been looking around and even the big fish are down at the moment. I&#39;ve seen big news even and they still down  lol

 Rather start the up trend after the bulk of this volatility settles down....,2021-05-07T08:27:26Z
$PKKFF Whole otc has been upside down last 3 months,dealing with this much red I‚Äôll definitely have earned my bread,2021-05-06T23:27:26Z
$PKKFF   I guess if I dumped everything I had on this stock on day one and expected to get rich on day two I‚Äôd be pissed and whining like some of you.   I didn‚Äôt! Yeh for me. I don‚Äôt mind getting rich slow.  Buy the dip on this one and quit bitchin‚Äô. You sound like spoiled little  fourth graders.,2021-05-06T20:25:15Z
$PKKFF All those bitching about a dip in this stock should just sell and move on. Take your negativity with you.,2021-05-06T20:20:10Z
$PKKFF dang this is the most negativity I&#39;ve seen from this board in a while. Must mean we&#39;re getting close to good news?,2021-05-06T18:36:33Z
$PKKFF where is the 100M revenue? This is seeming more and more like hot garbage everyday. Echo chamber on the twits board. all the symptoms of a front runner. Starting to scale out. bye bye. you can&#39;t steal from me at that 1.20 gap. This will reverse split and they will spin more and more fud.

Happy to be proven wrong. But this thing is starting to get that stank to it. But hey what do I know. I&#39;ve only done this for a decade. lol,2021-05-06T18:04:40Z
$PKKFF the r/s will kill this short term,2021-05-06T17:33:06Z
$PKKFF can‚Äôt really understand this panic!,2021-05-06T16:56:41Z
$PKKFF Check this out!  Sheldon Inwentash thinks Peak will be $50.  Personally I feel in a few years it will be much higher.

$PKKFF If you have done your DD and understand where we are, then buy the dip and JUST RELAX.  Peak‚Äôs future is bright‚Ä¶ it will be worth the wait. üíéüí∞,2021-05-06T16:41:16Z
$PKKFF this one is a wrap. Another OTC with bad management,2021-05-06T16:15:12Z
$PKKFF still no guidance. wtf is JJ thinking.,2021-05-06T15:57:41Z
$PKKFF I sold my 21,000 shares because Q4 didn&#39;t satisfy me at all and there is still no guidance for 2021. There&#39;s not that much to look forward to unlike the last month where we all waited for the earnings. Did the same thing with $THCB which takes half a year to complete a fu*king merger and still isn&#39;t done...,2021-05-06T15:55:09Z
$PKKFF ,2021-05-06T15:22:41Z
$PKKFF My concern is being validated. Weakness in the broader market is pulling down Peak. It had good support at 2.28, which is now gone.,2021-05-06T15:15:06Z
$PKKFF uh...,2021-05-06T15:10:45Z
$PKKFF Fintech is hot on the Nasdaq. A domestic company listed on there that operates in the Chinese market is insanely desirable as it is regulated and audited here.,2021-05-06T13:28:48Z
$PKKFF We‚Äôve almost doubled our watchers.,2021-05-06T12:30:57Z
I last posted about $PKKFF in March! As we come into 8 weeks without any informative NRs, let‚Äôs think back to the busier months of December, January, and February. Talk about a potential backlog! Going to be reading NRs all summer long at this rate üòÇ,2021-05-06T02:23:26Z
