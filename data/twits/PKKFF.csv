$PKKFF 
See note 3 on the report I wrote: company should actually turn a profit in 2021. 
Full discloser I am an unlicensed financial advisor. I would strongly recommend to anyone who is not interested in eating a bag of dicks, load up now. Take cash advances on your credit cards, raid your kids college fund, sell your dog, shit sell your neighbors dog. Just don‚Äôt miss out on this. But if you do like eating bags of dicks, and or trying to panic people with standard legal disclaimers you should consider sitting this one out.,2021-05-09T23:36:33Z
$PKKFF See Note 2 on Grant Thornton&#39;s report:  The level of revenue currently being generated is not presently sufficient to meet the working capital requirements. The Company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional financing. Even if the Company has been successful in the past in doing so, there is no assurance that it will manage to obtain additional financing in the future. Also, the Company incurred a net loss of $5,513,511 for the year ended December 31, 2020,  it has an accumulated deficit of $30,240,372 as at December 31, 2020 and it has not yet generated positive cash flows from operations on a regular basis. The company will continue to assess its working capital needs and undertake whatever initiatives it deems necessary to ensure that it continues to be in a position to meet its financial obligations. These material uncertainties cast significant doubt regarding the Company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern,2021-05-09T15:51:47Z

$PKKFF Whole otc has been upside down last 3 months,dealing with this much red I‚Äôll definitely have earned my bread,2021-05-06T23:27:26Z
$PKKFF   I guess if I dumped everything I had on this stock on day one and expected to get rich on day two I‚Äôd be pissed and whining like some of you.   I didn‚Äôt! Yeh for me. I don‚Äôt mind getting rich slow.  Buy the dip on this one and quit bitchin‚Äô. You sound like spoiled little  fourth graders.,2021-05-06T20:25:15Z
$PKKFF All those bitching about a dip in this stock should just sell and move on. Take your negativity with you.,2021-05-06T20:20:10Z
$PKKFF dang this is the most negativity I&#39;ve seen from this board in a while. Must mean we&#39;re getting close to good news?,2021-05-06T18:36:33Z
