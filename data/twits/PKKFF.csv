$PKKFF Whole otc has been upside down last 3 months,dealing with this much red Iâ€™ll definitely have earned my bread,2021-05-06T23:27:26Z
$PKKFF   I guess if I dumped everything I had on this stock on day one and expected to get rich on day two Iâ€™d be pissed and whining like some of you.   I didnâ€™t! Yeh for me. I donâ€™t mind getting rich slow.  Buy the dip on this one and quit bitchinâ€™. You sound like spoiled little  fourth graders.,2021-05-06T20:25:15Z
$PKKFF All those bitching about a dip in this stock should just sell and move on. Take your negativity with you.,2021-05-06T20:20:10Z
$PKKFF dang this is the most negativity I&#39;ve seen from this board in a while. Must mean we&#39;re getting close to good news?,2021-05-06T18:36:33Z
$PKKFF where is the 100M revenue? This is seeming more and more like hot garbage everyday. Echo chamber on the twits board. all the symptoms of a front runner. Starting to scale out. bye bye. you can&#39;t steal from me at that 1.20 gap. This will reverse split and they will spin more and more fud.

Happy to be proven wrong. But this thing is starting to get that stank to it. But hey what do I know. I&#39;ve only done this for a decade. lol,2021-05-06T18:04:40Z
$PKKFF the r/s will kill this short term,2021-05-06T17:33:06Z
$PKKFF canâ€™t really understand this panic!,2021-05-06T16:56:41Z
$PKKFF Check this out!  Sheldon Inwentash thinks Peak will be $50.  Personally I feel in a few years it will be much higher.

$PKKFF If you have done your DD and understand where we are, then buy the dip and JUST RELAX.  Peakâ€™s future is brightâ€¦ it will be worth the wait. ðŸ’ŽðŸ’°,2021-05-06T16:41:16Z
$PKKFF this one is a wrap. Another OTC with bad management,2021-05-06T16:15:12Z
$PKKFF still no guidance. wtf is JJ thinking.,2021-05-06T15:57:41Z
$PKKFF I sold my 21,000 shares because Q4 didn&#39;t satisfy me at all and there is still no guidance for 2021. There&#39;s not that much to look forward to unlike the last month where we all waited for the earnings. Did the same thing with $THCB which takes half a year to complete a fu*king merger and still isn&#39;t done...,2021-05-06T15:55:09Z
$PKKFF ,2021-05-06T15:22:41Z
$PKKFF My concern is being validated. Weakness in the broader market is pulling down Peak. It had good support at 2.28, which is now gone.,2021-05-06T15:15:06Z
$PKKFF uh...,2021-05-06T15:10:45Z
$PKKFF Fintech is hot on the Nasdaq. A domestic company listed on there that operates in the Chinese market is insanely desirable as it is regulated and audited here.,2021-05-06T13:28:48Z
$PKKFF Weâ€™ve almost doubled our watchers.,2021-05-06T12:30:57Z
I last posted about $PKKFF in March! As we come into 8 weeks without any informative NRs, letâ€™s think back to the busier months of December, January, and February. Talk about a potential backlog! Going to be reading NRs all summer long at this rate ðŸ˜‚,2021-05-06T02:23:26Z
$PKKFF according to the latest Yahoo article a reverse split is coming. 2:1 or 5:1. A RS is never good,2021-05-05T19:43:01Z
$PKKFF I keep hearing nasdaq, but this has to be over 4 to be listed. So is a RS in our future?,2021-05-05T13:59:13Z
$PKKFF  This is by far the strongest stock I have ever owned. Horrible markets affecting hundreds of stocks??  LOL  No problem :P,2021-05-05T06:31:36Z
$PKKFF Anyone else concerned that if the broader market does have a serious pullback, this will get dragged down too? Before it was just growth stocks that were dropping, now it&#39;s everything other than the re-opening plays. It only takes one whale to cause a major drop.,2021-05-04T22:47:30Z

$PKKFF,2021-05-04T20:31:22Z
$PKKFF doesn&#39;t drop, doesn&#39;t spike like alot of OTC stocks. Can&#39;t wait for the next leg up soon.,2021-05-04T19:14:35Z
$PKKFF this is a no brainer. Lots of significant catalysts in the short and long term here as detailed here in the posts.,2021-05-04T15:30:56Z
$PKKFF guess I really nice to time to buy ! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š,2021-05-04T14:31:28Z
$PKKFF @Steelvike you mean youâ€™re sorry you got in so late and sold. Most of us are up 400% minimum and not selling a single share as weâ€™ve done our DD,2021-05-04T14:30:13Z
$PKKFF glad I got out of this when I did,2021-05-04T14:22:30Z
$PKKFF Merger with Chinese fintech coming up.?,2021-05-04T01:18:48Z
