$PKKFF too undervalue to be ignored, China market potential is too huge to be ignored too. Have prepared myself for this launch to the moon since last year. I&#39;m looking at a 10 x potential within the next 5 years.,2021-05-30T06:51:52Z
$PKKFF The next week should be interesting.  Q1 results should be interesting.  I was hoping for 15-20M C$ in revenue, but think we might see a bit less.   

As for the SEDAR updates, this is a huge learning opportunity for the company and its leadership (as I have stated previously).  It will be interesting to see if any organizational changes are made in the next few months.  Its always the CFO and CEO who pay the price for what might be perceived as lack of proper controls.  Hope not, but that&#39;s business. 

Hang on.  Might take time but this company is a winner!,2021-05-29T18:18:41Z
$PKKFF  1 thing that makes no sense in todays day and age for an emerging growth company is the comparison of quarterly revenue in the prior year to the current.   IT MAKES NO SENSE.  Who gives a rats ass what happened in Q120 for a growth company.  YEah, I get cyclical patterns but not for a growth company, yeah for an established company but only as a memo
Sequential revenue and cash flow are the two most important metrics to look at when analyzing financial statements and MOST important for growth companies.  EBIT is meaningless for these type companies.   ITS ALL ABOUT REVENUE and CASH.  EBIT WILL COME IN GOOD ORDER.  Just look at AMAZON and APPLE.,2021-05-29T18:15:11Z

$PKKFF &quot;Early indications in Q1 2021 show revenue for the quarter to be considerably higher than what they 
were in Q1 2020. Due to the Chinese New Year Holiday, which happens in the first quarter, the first 
quarter has historically been the quarter in which the Company generates the least amount of 
revenue. Assuming that that trend continues and with the revenue run rate observed in Q1 2021, 
the Company is expecting overall revenue in 2021 to more than double 2020 revenue.&quot;

$PKKFF  think like a super bowl champion

your Tom Brady and there is a war being fought in the trenches all around you and you are the target.  some will run, some will retreat and some will bounce in the pocket and throw a strike to an open receiver.  

PEAK is under pressure, and as a shareholder you are under pressure.  what are you going to do?,2021-05-28T16:15:08Z

$PKKFF anything under 2 is a steal. Iâ€™ll be buying all the way down if it tests 1.5 (60% probability in my book) Iâ€™ll really load up. This potential is huuuuge but patience will likely be required for a huge pay day.,2021-05-28T12:21:04Z
