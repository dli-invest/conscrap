$PKKFF I keep checking as if it‚Äôs Monday! Weekends are moving so slowly‚Ä¶come on opening bell. How many more shares can I buy before it crests over 12‚Ä¶,2021-08-22T05:42:40Z
$PKKFF  Just a quick note of appreciation to this board and all the posters here. Great to have a place like this to chat and learn about a great company like Peak!    (I find myself commenting a bit much but its just because I&#39;m so stoked on this stock , lol),2021-08-21T19:00:48Z
$PKKFF Funny thing is, it won‚Äôt be too late to ‚Äòstart‚Äô a position here up to at least $30 ;),2021-08-21T15:49:31Z

$PKKFF Q2 earnings one week from today!,2021-08-20T23:37:05Z
$PKKFF Can I still buy l this or do I have to wait for it when it enters the nasdaq? If I try to buy at Binck (dutch) it say it can only be bought with ‚Äúclosing transactions‚Äù.,2021-08-20T23:36:57Z
$PKKFF Current cost $7.65 

Let&#39;s start a thread about your: 
lowest purchase price:
highest purchase price:
Average cost:

Here&#39;s mine: (All adjusted for post split)
 Lowest: $2.95

Highest: $8.42

Average: $3.99

The reason is not merely to brag, it&#39;s to show that even some of us early birds continue buy at these higher prices when we&#39;re able.  It may be more reasonably valued now, but it&#39;s still undervalued.,2021-08-20T21:29:53Z
$PKKFF some wise words from Clam on discord:

Not that it‚Äôs encouraged to watch the day to day but this week was a giant win for those that are long. Some solid consolidating and the start of a nice rebound. Peak showing it‚Äôs strength. 

Today is the second highest close Peak has seen and while Monday may have been a bit of a tease, we will see those numbers soon enough. 

Putting Monday aside, we are up $0.26 from last Fridays close and that‚Äôs a win in my books.,2021-08-20T20:49:52Z
$PKKFF FYI to my Tenet fans, there are a slew of ready made Tenet gifs straight from the movie. If you haven&#39;t already watched it I suggest you do. Rumor has it CEO JJ watched the movie and loved it so much, he asked Christopher Nolen if he could star in the sequel.  Christopher Nolen reportedly replied, &quot;John David Washington was a great actor, but if I have the chance to put JJ in the role, its a no brainer.&quot;. Even JDW apparently agreed with this assessment. Talks are preliminary however. More news to come later.

P.S. If you believe rumors on the internet you&#39;re a special kind of special and we love you despite your limitations.,2021-08-20T20:49:38Z
$PKKFF Have a wonderful weekend PKKFF/TNT family üíê,2021-08-20T20:34:32Z
$PKKFF can someone educate me on how it works with our shares when it gets listed on the NASDAQ? Do they keep both exchanges open or do our shares get transferred to TNT?,2021-08-20T20:32:29Z
