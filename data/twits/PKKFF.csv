$PKKFF Good,bad,ugly.and the retarded which one is PEAK?,2021-06-30T19:41:30Z
$PKKFF   i‚Äôm not an expert on listing requirements.  however, i believe the company must maintain a $4 price for at least 90 days.  
could be wrong but that‚Äôs been my past experience.  not sure why the lawyer would indicate 3-4 weeks.

call was OK, not sure we learned anything other than the delay.  seems mackie is a source of the delay based on JJ comment.
 
woukd be good to have cubeler done by q4.

from my perspective q2 results and the forecast needed to drive sp.

@mrinvestorpro Hi! new folower here and novice at stockmarket. You do OTC stocks at all? If you do, I would really appreciate your take on $PKKFF before I throw some serious cash in there. I‚Äôve done my dd, but I‚Äôm still learning the ropes so.. 
 
Anyway, thanks for all the tips and hard work you do to help others. Cheers!,2021-06-30T05:28:16Z
$PKKFF the longer this takes, the more I think its oversubscribed for $50mm from $15......let it marinate, it will be worth the wait.,2021-06-30T03:08:24Z
$PKKFF so word is the closing is July 7 now?  Which means no guidance until at-least then. It‚Äôs getting crazy now with all of these missed deadlines over and over. Investors losing patience here,2021-06-30T02:31:52Z
$PKKFF  waiting....... üßê,2021-06-30T00:27:13Z
$PKKFF  Damn shame here,JJ could‚Äôve been a great inspirational media mogul darling of color,how many African CEO,s are in the spotlight?Not enough.Instead PEAK wants to flounder as some inept,clumsy,buffoon that is quickly losing investor confidence,2021-06-29T22:17:53Z

Well shit. I guess I‚Äôll buy some more. At least that way I can pretend like I‚Äôm happy about this.,2021-06-29T16:58:04Z
$PKKFF if you wondering why the SP went from 3 CAD to 2 CAD, the reason is simple, the so called longs sold there shares and bought in the private offering, a so called &quot;Gilbert...&quot; user posted himself on the StockFam discord group, he also posted that he received his shares (from the private offering) today, obvious he&#39;s posts has been deleted in minutes after... I have cached some of the reactions to he&#39;s posts,2021-06-29T15:46:25Z

$PKKFF One door closes (offering) and many more will open. Keep an ear out today longs.,2021-06-29T11:47:01Z
$PKKFF Will break support in a few weeks. All you longs will get screwed.,2021-06-28T20:27:04Z
$PKKFF straight manipulation to get this under $2 cdn as that was the offering price.  Huge walls put up at end of day.  

Congrats to all that scooped them up.,2021-06-28T20:10:49Z
$PKKFF this is a good test of shareholders resolve, leadership resolve and truly that of smaller canadian based companies trying to follow suit of companies like Shopify.   the market is unrelenting and the otc is nothing but a leftist centric city rioting on a summer night ( a frickin uncontrolled free for all).

when you got something the MMs want ( and yes they are agents for the tutes and hfs) they will try to wear you down with continued daily selling price beatings.  

IF you believe hang in there.   Something is destined to break soon.,2021-06-28T19:55:13Z
