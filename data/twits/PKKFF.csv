$PKKFF the reality of the current situation is that PEAK is on the OTC.  No safe haven, no financial backstop (per se) although the PP says it should be about $2, no institutional buying  and no &quot;real&quot; credibility.   There are about 5200 other stocks trading on the OTC.  The delay has cost this company greatly and it remains to be seen if an uplist will happen.   I wouldnt bet on it in the near future.   Its a China driven stock and the CCP is cracking down.   So you have a few choices:  sell, hold or buy some more.   IMO, its dead money for a while.  Even with the forecast, I wouldnt count on the homerun.   Should it be trading higher, yes.   Why isnt it.   Well its stuck on the OTC and it remains to be seen when it uplists.   The uplist is the news the company needs.  The forecast will be great, but it is still ripe for manipulation and under valuation.   DOCRF is living proof.   Lets see what JJ brings to the table in the next couple of weeks.,2021-07-13T18:52:25Z
