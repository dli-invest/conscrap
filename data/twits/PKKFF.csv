CSRC Spokesperson: The capital markets in China and the U.S. both have global significance and are increasingly interconnected. As growing numbers of companies, investors, and financial services providers are participating in each otherâ€™s markets, strengthening regulatory cooperation is the inevitable path. Weâ€™ve taken notice of the recent statement made by the SEC, especially the new disclosure requirements for registration filers. It is our belief that Chinese and U.S. regulators shall continue to enhance communication with the principle of mutual respect and cooperation, and properly address the issues related to the supervision of China-based companies listed in the U.S., so as to form stable policy expectations and create benign rules framework for the market.,2021-08-29T04:55:56Z
$PKKFF  Once you do a little research into China&#39;s economic reforms you realize that there is a lot of misinformation flying around out there. 

  Peak is an amazing opportunity as they are in there working with the Chinese government on the ground floor of these necessary changes. 

 JJ has been doing business in china for the last 10 years so he knows what&#39;s up. It was like the wild west with consumer and business loans being handed out like candy with interest rates at like 25%. What does this do?  It destroys the economy.,2021-08-29T04:55:34Z

Does anyone else remember that time JJ said someday the data would be more valuable than the loans? Yep. The futures so bright I need sunglasses!,2021-08-29T02:50:38Z

I am expecting way more revenue than $104 million for 2021  after seeing this Q2 report. My reasoning is Q4 will have much more promotion and established adoption rates for all the verticals , and  there is also singles event in the last quarter. Q3 should be amazing also.  Its going to be the same old continuation of  Johnson Joseph over-delivering by a wide margin . I just don&#39;t see why analyst don&#39;t finally realize that projections will be a fast moving target for TNT , and i see no reason why this theme does not continue.  Actually i believe it actually accelerates due to the cash position , plus more verticals like advertising and the business data begins to really take effect in the future .  Logic sure does point to these conclusions . Looking forward to his revised financial predictions immediately after the cubeler closing.,2021-08-28T13:53:57Z

$PKKFF Still wowed by these Q2 earnings. They will easily beat their 2021 revenue guidance even without taking into account the NA expansion. This company is a champ. Raising my EOY price target to USD 20.,2021-08-28T08:48:20Z
$PKKFF  Great gain day with some healthy consolidation in the mix. Let those q2 numbers soak in over the weekend :),2021-08-28T05:29:53Z

$PKKFF Over a 20% increase in followers since I joined, which was only a few months ago. Drop a comment and let&#39;s introduce each other and yourselves. In two-three years I&#39;d enjoy a &quot;Peak Only&quot; family reunion, as our beloved company is about to become &quot;TNT&quot; and increase it&#39;s followers to at least 20,000.  That&#39;s a great thing of course but I&#39;d like to stay in touch with the early birds who share the same goal of wealth building though the powers of our Dear Leader JJ,2021-08-27T23:41:04Z
$PKKFF 1.9k shares filled out of 2k share @ $8.4. it&#39;s still cheap imo if we use valuate the company P/S of $104m CAD (84m USD) in 2021, it&#39;s around P/S 8 at the moment. Accumulating more share while i can. Let&#39;s enjoy the ride together.,2021-08-27T23:08:58Z

Mr. market came to my door today, begging me to sell him my shares.
I gave him a diet coke and gently asked him to come back by never,2021-08-27T19:59:18Z
$PKKFF Gents/Ladies. Take this as an opportunity to add. Rarely have I loaded up to this degree so fast. As long as execution stays the course, this is simply a gift.

Stay balanced, risk what you can, stay the course, measure/temper your emotions and you will be good. 

Look at the chart? Seriously.

Have a great weekend.,2021-08-27T19:40:55Z

$PKKFF   bravo, q2 revenue far better than my most bullish projection.  hats off to the Peak team.  
 
although itâ€™s your money highly recommend you hold and accumulate if you can. unless you need the cash, do not sell and do not try to trade it.  

based on wells fargo borrowing a substantial amount of my shares itâ€™s clear the stock price is being held back.  yes, held back.  i believe by those who might be interested in the US pp.  why, the lower the share price the more they can accumulate to hit the US $25-30m offering bogey.  you can bet JJ would the like share price higher to limit the dilution.  i think they raise 30m.  

well done and the best is yet to come.,2021-08-27T17:54:39Z
