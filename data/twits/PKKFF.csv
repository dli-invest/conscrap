$PKKFF JPMorgan says China tech stocks are in a &#39;good buying spot&#39; despite crackdown https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/11/investing-jpmorgan-bullish-on-china-techs-despite-regulatory-crackdown.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard,2021-05-11T08:33:14Z
$PKKFF  hmm  Looks like the Anonymous house that has had the bulk of the ask walls up (In excess of 300k at any given time) the last few weeks did some major moves trying to score a few stop loss trigger too.

   Also Cancord and a big pritvate shorter that uses Scotia has been in there too.  Mackie was in there today again at this exact SP close with a BIG buy.  

  This is exactly what you would expect to see before an offering close,  IMO,2021-05-11T08:01:52Z
