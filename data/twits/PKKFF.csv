$PKKFF does anyone know what will happen to my shares in OTC after PKKFF uplist to NASDAQ? does the share automatically transfer to TNT?,2021-06-15T05:02:41Z
$PKKFF Why was the offering repriced to $2.00?   All of these investors were ready to commit at $2.50-$2.60  and actually oversubscribed at $2.50-$2.60,2021-06-15T02:01:26Z

$PKKFF    What is PKKFF&#39;s basic business model?

Is PKKFF mainly an internet/software based lending hub which connects borrowers to lenders and receives a fee or commission on funded loans?  If so, wouldn&#39;t a multi-media advertising campaign be the way to spur growth, (e.g. Capital One credit cards or Ditech Funding)? For the enormous size of the market they are addressing and the enormous size of their alleged partners, it seems like past revenue and projected future revenue growth is paltry. PKKFF must be doing something wrong.,2021-06-14T17:00:50Z

$PKKFF time to accumulate more shares before this set of to mars, looking at the partnership with all the big company in China, this company will surely go far, it&#39;s a no brainer to go big on this one.. currently I&#39;m holding 47k shares, going to get it up to 60k shares if it goes down,2021-06-11T12:21:25Z
$PKKFF  Im good with this deal for sure. You know financing is always going to be at a discount (especially this much money, it&#39;s not peanuts folks). Then warrants at 3.50 makes it very fair actually!  Any experienced traders care to add some insight to this?

   I&#39;m no expert but this is a better deal then I&#39;ve seen on other stocks I&#39;ve owned that did cash raises for WAY less.,2021-06-11T10:39:38Z

$PKKFF For the last 3 months all we heard from the bashers, it’s a fake company, there is no news, this offering will never close, the ceo is a scammer taking your money, now that’s all put to rest. Now we will have to hear for the next 5 days offering is at $2. Ahh 5 more days and hopefully they will leave as there will be nothing else to say. See you in NA and Europe. Also when warrants get redeemed will be another $40 million for the company. Bye shorty,2021-06-11T00:31:34Z
$PKKFF Thats a raise worth waiting for...,2021-06-10T23:20:50Z
$PKKFF with the warrants that’s a $90m raise.... that’s not a micro cap raise lol. GLTA,2021-06-10T23:06:30Z
$PKKFF Looks like expansion to Europe as well as N.A.  GLTA 💎💰,2021-06-10T22:32:18Z
$PKKFF Offering discount to current SP is only 11%. Usually around 20%. Very good news. Warrants (non-tradable) at $3.5 also looks very good. Go time,2021-06-10T22:19:50Z
