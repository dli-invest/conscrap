$PKKFF   static ghost, can you leave the pumping of idkff held stocks off the pkkff board?  

just smells of some good old fashioned pumping.  we know the so called tie in of stockfam and idkff held stocks. and we are aware of the recent consulting/promotion arrangement of idkff and skelton (hammy).   this kind of stuff just smrlls suspicious.  

pkkff has the potential to be a generational wealth changing stock.  idkff is micro cap etf like company that holds pkkff and a number of other companies. but is not transparent in what it holds.  moreover, the leadership at idkff has some baggage.  no disrespect but leave it on the idkff board. 

investors snd potential investors of pkkff need to do their dd and have conviction abt the company, it‚Äôs leadership, technology, market potential and ability to execute.,2021-08-15T00:30:57Z

When do we see a pullback?,2021-08-14T15:00:57Z
$PKKFF Some may claim this is a reason for FUD. The way I see it is China has committed what they feel is a proportional response to one of their high ranking businesswomen being detained by the Canadians. To me, it&#39;s reason for further optimism, in that if there is further antagonism between Canada and China, China will keep it&#39;s response proportional to whatever perceived offense. I&#39;m not defending China&#39;s action here either. I simply wanted to share this with the community as it&#39;s one of the few potential reasons someone might worry about this stock, while at the same time expressing my opinion that there is no need to fear this. Thoughts?

$PKKFF Uplisting and the Cubeler acquisition allowing expansion into North America and Europe will keep this rocket fueled for years.  Only wish I added more earlier this year but still cheap so doubled up my shares.

$PKKFF @fastcapital n DD: wow u two must speak some other language. I‚Äôm saying peak is a great company with so much potential for growth. Where u get I‚Äôm bashing this company perplexes me. Go back to reading the funnies,2021-08-14T11:06:11Z
$PKKFF Don‚Äôt quote me but apparently they will also be listing on the Chinese (maybe it was Hong Kong?) exchange post NASDAQ. This thing is going to be one explosion at a time.,2021-08-14T11:02:51Z
$PKKFF @Jpwkeys you showed me one thing‚Ä¶ you never really do any dd in your stocks. watch out for this man he will scare you from winners and promote losers,2021-08-14T11:01:11Z
$PKKFF @fastcapital: you have just proved one thing to me: you were definitely not the valedictorian of your class .,2021-08-14T10:59:35Z
$PKKFF @Jpwkeys I never ever heard in all my years in investing heard anyone talking this much BS‚Ä¶ they work with the government not against they got a A rating from itüòÇüòÇüòÇ 
 
they are not in the Apple, nike, tesla line‚Ä¶ it has to do with big american brands in the US. they are not going to stop a company that helps the small chinese companies growth! 
 
you need to relearn chinese rules because you have absolutely 0 idea what you are talking about 
 
the chinese government loves growth especially when it helps the chinese companies and it is a canadian company not US üòÇüòÇüòÇ are you kidding me most stupid comment on this board,2021-08-14T10:54:23Z
$PKKFF Peak is getting noticed. Take the time to look at who is tagged at the bottom of the tweet.

$PKKFF @fastcapital, obviously you fail to comprehend the word sarcasm. Please look up the definition. Nike , Apple, Tesla, Starbucks etc were mentioned precisely because they are multi billion dollar companies thriving in China, as I suspect Peak will thrive too. My point was if the Chinese communist party didn‚Äôt destroy these billion dollar behemoths, I seriously doubt they would destroy peak, which is tiny in comparison . But I also understand that China doesn‚Äôt operate  like the US, or Canada, or Europe. The CCP can make things difficult for a company if they want to.,2021-08-14T10:24:50Z
$PKKFF ideas for the price-action uplisted. Usually things drop like a brick after getting uplisted. Share your thoughts and reasoning please,2021-08-14T09:15:01Z
$PKKFF @croaker95: ya no way will
the Chinese communist party let a foreign company operating in China get that big. Just like they crushed Apple, Nike, Tesla, Starbucks, etc. Ya these billion dollar foreign companies are almost broke because of the CCP. If ur gonna bash Peak, at least make an argument that makes some sense .,2021-08-14T04:38:57Z
$PKKFF for new investors who are interested in a treasure trove of due diligence and ongoing astute analysis on Peak - soon to be TNT on the Nasdaq. I am thinking we‚Äôll be officially unlisted sometime this week. CEO recently said sometime this month. üß®
