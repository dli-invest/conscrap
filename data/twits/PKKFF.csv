$PKKFF For those of you freaking out about the recent dip. A reminder we are up 700% over the last 12 months. Patience grasshoppers...,2021-06-02T21:17:14Z
$PKKFF  Patience needed. 
 The warrants and options are an overhang for this company.  Stock options are needed to attract talented leadership, OK.  However, A plan needs to be put in place to close out the warrants as the company moves forward.  The Q1  data was great, the presentation was poor, esp. the Finance piece.   Investors look to disruptive capability (check). market size (check), moat (check) and leadership (no check here, yet). As a company transitions from micro to nasdaq, you need a strong CEO and CFO, at minimum.   JJ is a young CEO, has done a good job leading and will just get better.  Jean, as CFO, looks to be seasoned vet, great for start-up but IMO lacks the skills necessary to be CFO for Nasdaq growth company.  Nothing personal, just didnt seem to be in the CFOs wheelhouse to do an investor presentation.  IMO, this is a huge gap and oppty as insty investor relationships are key.  

BTW, P&amp;L means little at this point,  ITS about revenue growth and cash flow.,2021-06-02T20:35:10Z
$PKKFF Why is it down 6.5% after the meeting?  Dilution:  There were 10 million warrants exercised in the first quarter  and the shares now total 128,086,286.  There are still still 19,460,869 warrants exercisable at .48 cents and stock options (payable to Officers, Directors and Employees, as well as others providing services) of 8,863,500 at 0.74 cents. The book value now is only 0.28 due to the loss of $936,611 and the increase in outstanding shares.  In addition, the loans overdue 90 days increased from 16.2% at Dec 31 to 18.4% at March 31.  That&#39;s all before they do any PP.  That&#39;s already potential dilutive contractual warrants and options.,2021-06-02T19:22:31Z
$PKKFF Stop loss Raids and Shorts been running Peak lately,I’ll be patient n lock up my shares,2021-06-02T18:23:46Z
$PKKFF well this has been a disappointing day,2021-06-02T18:19:30Z
$PKKFF  won’t make money until Jane and the other shorting MM,s get lost,they’ve killed the OTC,2021-06-02T18:07:24Z
$PKKFF I’ve never made money on this stock. It only goes down when I buy.,2021-06-02T17:36:29Z
$PKKFF Apparently not a very inspiring conference call?  I guess I should listen myself.,2021-06-02T16:44:54Z
$PKKFF this fucking stock man.,2021-06-02T15:20:21Z
$PKKFF good time to load up. There will be this kind of volatility both ways until PP is closed, which should happen within next two weeks time. IMO,2021-06-02T15:11:15Z
$PKKFF I&#39;ll be honest kinda surprised by today&#39;s price movement even if I didnt like the way they displayed the financials,2021-06-02T14:58:58Z
$PKKFF another 1k shares in my pocket as well,2021-06-02T14:53:34Z
$PKKFF I picked up another 1000 this morning,2021-06-02T14:40:15Z
$PKKFF what did management mention on yesterday&#39;s call for today&#39;s reaction??? Any thoughts?,2021-06-02T14:00:00Z
$PKKFF note Q2 they will be profitable and prospectus could happen in June they think lots of clients will come on the lending platform through the ShopEx deal in the coming months and eternity
2-3yrs down the line the profit margins will be anywhere from 50-60%
They are just getting warmed up! just some of the best points moving forward although there were MANY! watch it yourself for more points,2021-06-02T13:07:26Z
$PKKFF well I&#39;m impressed I did not think NA expansion would be this year,2021-06-02T11:38:54Z
$PKKFF North American expansion late Summer/Early Fall. This is sooner than I expected and very big news!,2021-06-02T01:38:30Z
$PKKFF PP should be close in a few weeks. On the call, the CEO gave till the end of June, but was certain it would be sooner.  Also, forecast coming in approx. two weeks. This all sets the stage for the uplisting to Nasdaq.,2021-06-02T01:35:44Z

$PKKFF how did the call go?,2021-06-01T21:56:29Z
$PKKFF I&#39;m a happy shareholder. I love that they give ordinary shareholders the option to ask a question and not just the professional analysts who sometimes hardly have a clue or don&#39;t ask the question that everyone is waiting for.

JJ definitely has big plans for Peak and I am very excited to see where he will take us. 

One thing I would like is to see more structure in presenting the financials, because at times it was a bit hard to follow imo. But then again they do speak for themselves.,2021-06-01T21:28:19Z
$PKKFF is there link for tonight&#39;s call?,2021-06-01T17:07:20Z
$PKKFF 
If you look at the mid quarter report, it looks like Peak only had about 21 million in transactions that they earn a fee on. With the Chinese holiday ending mid Feb, that means most of the revenues reported for the first qtr came late Feb and March. This leads me to believe the 2nd qtr numbers could be quite shocking.  Maybe we’ll get more clarity on this on the call. Any thoughts?,2021-06-01T16:45:32Z
$PKKFF question do think they can mention nasdaq listing on call tonight ? I have not heard a management call yet and wondering ahead ..,2021-06-01T15:17:47Z

$PKKFF We need more eyes. Volume is not on par with what this company has to offer.,2021-06-01T14:25:42Z
$PKKFF when should we expect a NASDAQ update?,2021-06-01T14:15:40Z
$PKKFF 
Glad I added last week. This is just the beginning. So much more news coming!!,2021-06-01T13:53:48Z
