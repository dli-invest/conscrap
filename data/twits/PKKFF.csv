$PKKFF Saturday afternoon in Western Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ and Iâ€™m still trying to read and learn more about Peak! 

Where are you located as you read my post! 

Excited for the coming weeks &amp; months ahead.  My god the future looks so bright.,2021-04-10T21:02:58Z
$PKKFF And to everyone who is afraid of the reverse split: don&#39;t be! In this case its a positive catalyst. Assuming that the SP upon uplist won&#39;t be $5, they will be doing it so that big institutions (who can&#39;t invest in companies with a SP under $5) can get in upon uplist. It will also tighten the float of the stock. Once institutions will be fighting for shares on Nasdaq, this will rocket.,2021-04-10T09:50:56Z
$PKKFF Made an account just for Peak (soon to be renamed to Tenet, ticker $TNT). Holding since 2018. The company has so many short-term catalysts coming. A.o.: (a) approval of Nasdaq uplist, (b) 2021 and 2022 revenue guidance, (c) Q4 2020 numbers (expect a big beat), (d) more information on (signed) Pinduoduo deal, (e) expansion to North America. Wouldn&#39;t surprise me if the SP is at $40 mid summer. They should do like $200m revenues this year and $500m revenues next year, not taking into account any new deals and the expansion to North America, and will likely be profitable this year. Simply compare the multiples given to similar fintech companies in the US, Affirm and Upstart (30-40x 2021 revenues), to Peak (1x 2021 revenues) and it is evident that Peak is MASSIVELY undervalued. Looking forward to the ride this year. Hopefully conservative 2021 revenue guidance that will be beat each quarter resulting in massive upswings of the SP. What an opportunity to get in at ground level.,2021-04-10T09:48:23Z
$PKKFF not a ton of movement here which some may think makes it boring but I just keep adding shares quietly. I think we have a winner here. Time will tell.,2021-04-09T21:31:51Z
$PKKFF go Peak! Difficult to find a limit to this play... great times ahead!,2021-04-09T20:37:16Z
$PKKFF Nice to see some movement but we still need volume. Just goes to show how little it takes to get the sp moving. This is going to fly when actual catalysts start hitting.,2021-04-09T18:25:24Z

$PKKFF To those on this board, NOW is the time to buy... we are moving to the Nasdaq, we will execute on the significant agreements in place, we will expand to NA, the stage is set for a significant move up and our growth will continue for years.  

Be sure to read the progress report posted yesterday and if you have questions, ask the board as there are many knowledgeable investors on here. Good luck gang and I hope this stock can be a life changer for you!

$PKKFF Well I had to unexpectedly sell Boeing this morning and guess what I bought more of:-),2021-04-09T13:40:20Z
$PKKFF ,2021-04-09T06:51:22Z
$PKKFF Excellent progress report ðŸ‘‡.  Within hours of the offering, Peak had received interest in excess of $20M... Oversubscribed ðŸ§¨ Also, they are in discussions to purchase Cubeler Lending hub which makes a lot of sense.  Love the DOMINOES WILL FALL statement.   Great days ahead!  ðŸ’ŽðŸ’°ðŸ’ŽðŸ’°ðŸ’ŽðŸ’°ðŸ’ŽðŸ’°ðŸ’ŽðŸ’°ðŸ’ŽðŸ’°ðŸ’ŽðŸ’°ðŸ’ŽðŸ’°,2021-04-09T01:10:54Z
$PKKFF lots of juicy info here.  Over prescribed PP.  Using that money to accelerate deployment of lending hub to North America.

$PKKFF Made an inquiry to Mark at the MZ Group regarding the status of the public offering. 

He replied within minutes saying:  â€œIn terms of the offering, I can&#39;t speak in specific terms about the delay.  I know the company has a history of being on time with their announced deadlines.  In general for offerings there are always legal and regulatory items that need to addressed, those often are out of the hands of the company in terms of time frame.   We do expect it to close and certainly understand the concern about why it has not. â€œ,2021-04-08T18:54:12Z
$PKKFF lol Mackie wall gone again , bids are filling in around there now. Good to know they are there to support this level.  Short volume is around 400k over last few days,  beware of the dragon up there flying around behind the clouds  lol,2021-04-08T11:30:11Z
$PKKFF  Mackie has big bid wall up he he he :),2021-04-08T10:33:00Z
$PKKFF does this help with the questions below?
The regular bid price of shares of the company&#39;s stock at the time of listing must be at least $4.00. However, a company may qualify under a closing price alternative of $3.00 or $2.00 if the company meets varying requirements.,2021-04-08T02:53:11Z
$PKKFF are they doing a reverse split here to get price above $4 nasdaq requirements?,2021-04-07T20:08:01Z
$PKKFF doesn&#39;t this have to be a minimum price to move up to Nasdaq?,2021-04-07T19:55:39Z
$PKKFF Supposedly the company is doing great, or so we are told.  When do we get some hard numbers to decide for ourselves?,2021-04-07T18:34:14Z
