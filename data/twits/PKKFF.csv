Bought in today 10k worth friend of mine introduced me to PKK but picked up US  instead anyone needing more info check out Wall Street reporter great interviews etc serious movement soon,2021-08-25T20:37:09Z
$PKKFF the last interview with JJ, he said NASDAQ within 2 weeks/ maybe 3weeks if there was any delay! I‚Äôm sure we are past the 3 week timeframe already so get ready for news anytime soon.
Slowly adding shares at this level and have hit my limit. Ready for a surprise now!!,2021-08-25T19:09:21Z
$PKKFF ok I‚Äôm a bit giddy here during this consolidation if you want to call it that‚Ä¶ 3/4 day trading and under 98K volume. So I bought 14 more shares to help nudge it over 100K.,2021-08-25T18:36:51Z
$PKKFF This company is supposed to have over $1 Billion market cap, right now. If you&#39;re fence sitting, wanting to buy in but waiting on the right time, I&#39;d certainly consider going ahead and starting your position. I just don&#39;t see any meaningful &quot;pullbacks&quot; occurring until we&#39;re well above $1 billion.  And once we cross that threshold, I don&#39;t see us going below it.  Just my opinion.,2021-08-25T18:19:46Z
$PKKFF think Nasdaq next month now tbh. These things never go smoothly. Thankfully we don&#39;t have a load of knee jerking jerks here. Consolidating for the next leg up.,2021-08-25T18:16:19Z

$PKKFF Reaction from Cathy Peak/Tenet investor relations for Nasdaq: 
 
We have been expecting an announcement every day this week! I have not heard of anything in the way. I can tell shareholders are in nail-biting mode with the volume of emails and calls we are all getting....there is nothing to worry about. üòä

$BLFS What a beauty‚Ä¶.. $PKKFF see what happens when uplifting ‚Ä¶ Nice slowly and steady strong stock, no pumpers or bashers‚Ä¶ keep it going. Same like $BCRX and hopefully soon also for $ISPC and $WISA ‚Ä¶. Enjoy the ride(s),2021-08-25T15:48:27Z

$PKKFF Upstart at 220. MKT cap of 17.7 Billon.  For those that are new like me. Um. Yes. This is an opportunity you will not want to miss.

Do your DD, but, this is in front of you and happening.,2021-08-25T15:30:00Z

$PKKFF My guess based on PR releases and recent lack thereof is a PR on Thursday or Friday about uplist and then uplist on Monday or Tuesday.
100% speculation, but there it is :),2021-08-25T13:20:13Z
$PKKFF Can‚Äôt wait for actual volume. Past week has been like 1/4 of average.,2021-08-25T13:19:48Z
