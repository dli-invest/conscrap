$PKKFF So much time and energy being spent to try and shut down a &#39;troll&#39;,2021-09-02T05:14:56Z
$PKKFF Funny how it&#39;s the same posters with no real discussion, either bashing anyone who asks a question or posting something about how great Peak is.,2021-09-02T05:13:23Z
$PKKFF  Arcticyam is a pretty funny caricature.  Started a few days ago on a new account asking dumb questions. I took the time to dig up links and info  for the guy, then he just makes new posts asking the same thing and says no one will answer him.

  Not sure why dorks like him actually think that bashing on a chat room moves stock price. And quite frankly I don&#39;t want anyone who is stupid enough to come to chat rooms and listen to what guys like this say owning the stock. Weak hands are unhealthy.

  Always do your own DD  and back up what you hear with it.

  Anyways , not waiting anymore time on this clown, blocked / muted.,2021-09-02T04:07:24Z
$PKKFF For those new to this board, simply ‚ÄúBlock‚Äù the noise like I did on day 1‚Ä¶ makes for a cleaner read!!!  

Now focusing on Peak - this company continues daily with positive upward momentum based soundly on fundamentals.  Many here are bulls and rightly so‚Ä¶ we recognize what‚Äôs to come!  We are now days away from our Nasdaq uplist.  If you are looking for a growth story that is just beginning then welcome to the Peak Fam!  This party is just starting and the next several years are going to be a great ride!  üß®üß®,2021-09-02T03:05:23Z

$PKKFF I‚Äôm here reading all the posts from articyam and all the replies back and I can‚Äôt stop laughing.  I‚Äôm almost crying actually from it.   articyam is allowed to spew his hate, that‚Äôs his right but It‚Äôs a shame that new investors will come here for info and see articyams comments and get scared or nervous about peak or worse a shareholder who Doesn‚Äôt fully grasp peak would sell Their shares.,2021-09-02T01:58:45Z

$PKKFF articam: I don‚Äôt have any issue with someone having a bearish view of any stock, but I usually like to hear some rational analysis as to why, rather than oh back in 2017 blah blah blah.,2021-09-02T00:57:50Z
$PKKFF https://ceo.ca/pkk I wonder if anyone was around back in 2017. PKK looked so promising then didn&#39;t it.,2021-09-02T00:14:21Z

$PKKFF Funny how you mention anything remotely curious, let alone negative towards Peak and you get bashed. Does that sound normal?,2021-09-01T23:43:48Z
$PKKFF  bears popping up here because they either sold too early or didnt buy in.  LOL

We are in the 2nd inning of a extra inning game... get in now or forever regret.,2021-09-01T23:38:10Z
$PKKFF I have risky plays and what I consider safer plays.  I think many of us put Peak in the safer bucket.

Measured risk, but I Like This Stock.

$PKKFF From the Zacks Research Report:

&quot;Based on this multiple (14.9 times revs) 
and our estimate for Peak‚Äôs 2021 sales of CN$121 million or US$96 million, and using fully diluted shares of 111.7 million, the enterprise value would be US$1.43 billion and the market value US$1.45 billion. The stock price would be approximately US$13.00. If the company‚Äôs CN$300 million (US$238 million) 2022 estimate is achieved or even low, that stock price could move to $32.00 per share next year.&quot;,2021-09-01T21:58:17Z

$PKKFF Zack‚Äôs includes the Cubeler acquisition, but does not account for the revised upward guidance as a result of that acquisition. We‚Äôll get that revised guidance upon the transaction closing later this month. So, Zack‚Äôs will need to revise their price target. üÜô‚¨ÜÔ∏è,2021-09-01T18:40:52Z
