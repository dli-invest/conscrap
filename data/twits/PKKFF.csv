$PKKFF  get ready for the onslaught of bears next week when the bull train runs .... bears always show up who&#39;s either shorting and needs to cover but can&#39;t or sold too early and regrets it  ......,2021-06-26T01:53:47Z
$PKKFF I am finally back. Turns out I was wrong about Peak. This shitshow is nothing but an atm machine for JJ. When they started talking about Reverse Splits in order to get institutional support is when I realized what a bs operation they have going on here. What happened to Nasdaq by April? The only thing we got was more dilution and more warrants. Pinduoduo never even acknowledged Peak. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the only work they did for Pinduoduo was delivering a pallet of Jujifruits. 

The main problem though? JJ and friends OWN cubeler. How the hell can Peak not have a conflict of interest in acquiring Cubeler when it&#39;s owned by the CEO of Peak? Is JJ going to haggle for a good deal with himself in front of a mirror? What a disaster. I bailed a few months ago at $2.25 and I&#39;m glad I did. See you all in the Grey-sheets.,2021-06-26T01:25:34Z
$PKKFF why is anyone talking about an RS? Did I miss anything? If it&#39;s just conjecture than STFU. My belief is that $peak is in a quiet period and cannot release any news. Once that ends, whatever pent up news is released it will propel the stock high enough for nasdaq. Therefore no need for an RS. If they have to RS it won&#39;t be for a bad reason, so win win.,2021-06-26T00:18:58Z

$PKKFF Alright. Grabbed another 20K shares. Thanks/Merci,2021-06-25T17:51:51Z
$PKKFF  I had load more this morning.  If you know, then you know.,2021-06-25T16:04:08Z
$PKKFF I sold out. I&#39;ll keep checking but I don&#39;t see much going on on the near term. At this pace, Nasdaq won&#39;t ever happen, even with a RS of 1:3,  the SP won&#39;t hit $5.  And if they ever carry on with the RS, the price will drop another 20% anyway. It feels they need a 1:10 RS at this point to make it to NASDAQ. 
I&#39;m also upset about the whole PDD fiasco (a few months ago). I feel they lied to their investors back then.,2021-06-25T14:08:40Z

3 STONKS TO BUY TODAY 25 June: $PKKFF $FUNFF $SLHG THANK ME IN 1 MONTH üíùü§Æüí∞‚ùóÔ∏è,2021-06-25T12:08:41Z
$PKKFF in response to DDcap, one of my thoughts is that the Ccp (thru a state run bank) might swoop in with the offer.   this was my thinking earlier in the week which many didn‚Äôt understand.  why would they not? 

don‚Äôt you think it makes more sense to rip cubeler into emerging markets (india, indonesia, africa, latin america)? vs trying to monetize the data?  it should be plug/play?
what data monetization is needed in na that doesnt exist? 

why would Peak not pursue EM and instead try to focus on NA/E?  certainly they are ginormous markets, but how do you enter?  it‚Äôs crowded. 

so two things come to mind?  license tech in NA and E to big player (amazon, shopify, square, visa, mc, etc) and/or M&amp;A with China for China channel. 

imo, you can not underestimate the ccp.  peaks model fits, connects and provides seamless rich data.  who better to control that data than the ccp?

imo, somethings brewing or discovered.  mind boggling that the pp has not closed.,2021-06-25T12:05:14Z

$PKKFF https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-24/how-xi-and-the-ccp-turned-on-jack-ma-ant-and-china-s-fintech-companies

interesting article, not sure what impact, if any, it may have on PEAK.  from my DD, seems we are well connected and aligned with the CCP.  that said, changes can happen quickly and with little warning. 

should be an interesting next 6 months,2021-06-25T02:09:00Z
$PKKFF I can see my buying more here. Got 2700 now at 1.86 avg..,2021-06-24T22:21:47Z
$PKKFF  I cant believe I slapped another 10k shares.... not happy with the delays and revised sedar docs but it gives me more time to keep loading..... Prob one of my highest conviction plays.  Expecting PO to close by Jun 30th , this will/should get interesting......,2021-06-24T18:45:39Z
$PKKFF The next week should be great and I‚Äôm excited what‚Äôs to come.  I will be taking a pause from posting here as there is just too much complaining going on for me.  

Know what you own and take comfort in that. Cheers and GLTA üíéüß®üí∞,2021-06-24T18:09:16Z
$PKKFF Hopefully I am not the only one getting in at an average of $2.2 USD. Honestly I feel being fucked by the company management and the MMs. Long term very impressed with what the company achieved so far, especially the China team. But the company must learn from the mistakes and take actions accordingly.,2021-06-24T17:26:30Z

$PKKFF JRockford nailed it again. Good job !,2021-06-24T14:52:39Z
$PKKFF Of all the posts I‚Äôve read, n some are very good, I think JRockford has nailed it multiple times n his last two posts are just spot on IMO. And no I don‚Äôt know JRockford but his analysis of this company is excellent n I just happen to have similar sentiments about this company and the direction it is going. Execution is critical n the longer it takes, the more likely another competitor supplants it . Hope it turns out well for all the investors.,2021-06-24T14:40:56Z
