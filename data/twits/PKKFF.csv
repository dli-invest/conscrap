$PKKFF 5:1 r/s ??,2021-06-24T00:03:33Z
$PKKFF   to those who think
i‚Äôm anti peak and anti peak leadership, it‚Äôs not the case.  been part of a fortune 100 subsid start up.  what always impressed me was that our leadership and the parent leadership recognized when we more moving from vision to strategy to execution.  with that, the visionaries moved on and the executionaries moved in.  rather seamless and oh so effective.  

imo, that‚Äôs precisely where peak na is at.  the current team
did the heavy lifting to get the co. here and now it‚Äôs time for the next wave to advance it further.  imo, every day it lags is a day lost to a competitor.  

evaluate emerging growth companies on revenue and cash.  proxy for me is 10-30 times annual revenue.  peak is big time undervalued and even more with the games.

e.g. 2021 rev = 100m
multiple = 20
mc = 2b
o/s shares pre split =150m
selling price = 13

bottom line, if the market values peak when on nasdaq they will be given high multiple -i bet 30 assuming revenue / growth model supports,2021-06-23T21:26:10Z
$PKKFF  well it seems those in charge of the selling price want an upsized reverse split to reduce the amount of shares outstanding.  imo, this could mean that retail will be limited in buying significant shares after the r/s because of the higher selling price.  if the stock is in demand, the mms as agents for tutes and HFs could rip it higher and limiting retail.

every shareholder needs to evaluate for themselves what they need to
do if they want more shares.  
although i am not accumulating more fidelity has told me that there are few shares available to loan.  bit surprised as the  interest rate hovers around 5%.  

imo, the business model is right time, right place esp. in china and emerging markets.  seems like plug/play to me but, you need to know china has influence.

my dd says the peak china team is top notch, top notch! need similar in na to execute unless it‚Äôs license to a big player.

need to overcome the 1H issues and grow the team. time to get er done, Peak.,2021-06-23T21:09:49Z

$PKKFF  Next Support level is $1.50 USD if that breaks we‚Äôre looking at $1.00.CFO should‚Äôve never given JJ the green light to optimistically discuss an uplist when the CFO is incapable of delivering on his end,yes they admit they need to hire more talent and at Least smart enough to realize the current management isn‚Äôt experienced enough to satisfy the regulatory standards.Gonna need more then a 3/1 RS if the incompetent mishandling of pertinent information continues.Still Bullish and patient ,a lot of retail sellers will trade their shares to the patient,2021-06-23T16:45:14Z
$PKKFF how is this tanking today ? Unreal. Radio silence from company,2021-06-23T16:33:57Z
$PKKFF until something material actually happens the SP means nothing to me. Also I don‚Äôt plan on selling for a few years anyway. This is just a nice area to continue to accumulate a little more each day. Don‚Äôt know where the bottom is but I‚Äôll get shares at all price points in this crater until it starts inevitably going up. Patience and steel hands will pay off. Looking forward to the meeting, guidance, and Q2 numbers,2021-06-23T16:28:01Z
$PKKFF if you can&#39;t stomach this going below $1 then sell your stock now and look for another type of investment. I&#39;m not saying it will dip below $1, but when you invest in microcaps like these you can&#39;t be all sad about a 50% drop or exuberant about a 50% increase. Those price movements happen all the time, and pretty often they happen back to back. All microcaps are story stocks, in that they have little to show for right now, but you trust management and the product. Don&#39;t invest what you can&#39;t afford to lose.,2021-06-23T15:27:59Z
$PKKFF Patience is a Virtue Meaning: The ability to wait for something without frustration is a useful skill and a good aspect of one&#39;s personality.

$PKKFF Go to LinkedIn n read experience of the controller. If that inspires confidence, please give me some of the kool aid cuz I‚Äôm not convinced . And read the CFO background on the PEAK site n nothing specific about his experience ‚Ä¶ what prior companies n specific positions. Yes I agree they have grown revenue as did costs. Earnings n cash flow to grow the business remain elusive. All I‚Äôm saying is that the people in key positions for Nasdaq n continued growth n expansion is going to require more pedigree. IMO. I‚Äôm still optimistic but less so by the day.,2021-06-22T23:01:05Z
$PKKFF Since everyone else posting their opinion on Management and seems to be a hot topic fueled by frustration over the offering closing and no share price movement as of late, no board is going to get rid of a management team that grew the company from 1.8M revenue to 42M in 3 years and potentially could reach close to 100M this year. Over what, an offering taking 2 months longer than expected and running into unforeseen regulatory hurdles? Wow, get rid of them!! The reality is they implemented a strategy and its working, why would they need to be replaced? A typo in the FS? The reality is none of you criticizing them have any idea what‚Äôs going on behind the door , you‚Äôre mostly just frustrated with this dark period. With all that being said, I‚Äôm not arguing that they shouldn‚Äôt bring on needed talent to complement growth, entering the ‚Äúbig leagues‚Äù etc (which we‚Äôve seen recently with marketing hire and controller hire). JJ stated already part of this capital raise is for that.,2021-06-22T21:11:25Z
$PKKFF I couldn‚Äôt have said it any better than J Rockford. He is absolutely correct. I‚Äôm having serious doubts with regard to this present management team‚Äôs ability to expand this company to the next level. The potential of PEAK is incredible but the management is mediocre at best. They just don‚Äôt have the talent to create the next Upstart, unfortunately.,2021-06-22T20:55:14Z
$PKKFF Peak‚Äôs slide decks (English &amp; French) just got posted on SEDAR.,2021-06-22T19:23:15Z
$PKKFF Lets give Peak a few months to recruit hard and attract top talent.  @jrockford is correct, it‚Äôs not going to be cheap but its needed and well worth it to meet the market challenges ahead and also to deliver a winning Nasdaq formula.  I‚Äôm confident these steps are already underway - time will reveal whether I‚Äôm right or not! üíéüß®üí∞,2021-06-22T18:30:54Z
