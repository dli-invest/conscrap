$PKKFF I‚Äôm still waiting for my money to transfer into my account and it‚Äôs killing me. I‚Äôve never logged in so many times in one day hoping it‚Äôs there, even tho I know it isn‚Äôt since I haven‚Äôt received an email notification. LETS GO, THIS THING IS GONNA POP SOON BABY.,2021-08-04T23:04:50Z
$PSTH My ‚Äúp‚Äù stocks are pissing me off‚Ä¶ PSTH, PSTH.WT $PSFE , $PLTR  $PKKFF  and  $PSH  .ü§¨,2021-08-04T21:50:49Z
$PKKFF Here&#39;s a decent comparable on financial metrics. MAXR has a similar float and their current numbers match Peak‚Äôs guidance. They&#39;re about a $50 stock. That&#39;s what we are holding and what we have to look forward to long term. I&#39;m sure some of you are just shaking your heads when you see selling lol. üôÑ,2021-08-04T21:13:21Z

$PKKFF I wonder if we will get some news about Nasdaq of approximate debut date in the next couple of days. I heard mid-month, either way this has been a great couple days to add some more, thanks to those you gave me some more shares today. :-),2021-08-04T18:26:10Z
$PKKFF Bought more for my Roth. 
I‚Äôm saving some dry powder to buy options once on the NASDAQ.,2021-08-04T16:13:54Z
$PKKFF Am I the only  retail investor on here that purchased shares on July 28???,2021-08-04T16:02:02Z
$PKKFF why do you guys think this will go up when listed on Nasdaq? It is already on exchange in Canada, so it is ready for intuitions. Will that make such a difference?,2021-08-04T15:48:21Z
$PKKFF Vanguard has reported to me that Peak Fintech made the decision to push back the date of &quot;allotment&quot; of shares from July 27th until August 2nd, and that is the reason my shares were split even though I purchased them on the 28th. So, in short, Vanguard is blaming Peak for me losing over $3,000. 

It sounds so unbelievable. But I told the man I spoke to that I was recording this conversation. He spoke to someone from their corporate actions department who told him that Peak Fintech is to blame, not my brokerage, for splitting the shares I purchased at $4, a day after the reverse split occurred! So now when I get off work I&#39;ll be busy all afternoon filing complaints to FINRA, SEC and the Canadian Securities agency, on both my brokerage and Peak. 

It&#39;s hard to believe this is true: The company I&#39;m so invested in fumbled their reverse split and fucked me out of over $3,000 in shares in the process.,2021-08-04T15:42:11Z

$PKKFF  Was surprised CND side finished up 3 cents today lol.  Nice healthy pull here, never want a stock to get too hot and never have a pull here and there :)  The day was wild actually,  saw a lot of  shares trading over into some stronger hands though.,2021-08-04T07:16:10Z

$PKKFF Wow-
&quot;In December 2020, Peak announced that Xingcheng Special Steel Works Ltd. (&quot;XSSW&quot;), China&#39;s 2nd largest supplier of special steel products, had joined its Business Hub ecosystem as a certified supplier. This meant that purchase orders placed with XSSW through the Business Hub were now eligible to be financed. Since then, almost 1,000 combined XSSW clients and steel traders have joined the ecosystem, prompting Peak to develop and launch the Link-Steel platform to better fit their needs.&quot;,2021-08-03T23:24:25Z

$PKKFF very excited about this company I think it has huge potential and think I‚Äôm 3-5 years we‚Äôll be greatful for buying in pre split. Good luck to all,2021-08-03T18:39:24Z
$PKKFF I&#39;m going to help y&#39;all by giving you for free the hard lesson I&#39;ve learned:  Don&#39;t ever buy shares on the day of a split, even if the price increased to the ratio. Doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that the market makers have split the shares traded. I&#39;m going through some hell getting my account fixed. 1708 shares purchased on the 28th, 1000 of those at $4, and they&#39;ve been split by my brokerage Vanguard.,2021-08-03T17:39:18Z
