$PKKFF What does it mean!!?,2021-04-28T19:58:40Z
$PKKFF volume coming in,.....,2021-04-28T19:53:20Z
$THCB I&#39;m being honest. I just sold my 2,000 shares because at this point it seems like dead money. I&#39;m pretty sure that the merger will take place in the middle of May. It seems not too far away for some but looking at $NGA having the merger finally the next few days or $PKKFF releasing guidance for 2021 most likely on Friday it&#39;s far away for me and my speculations. If it turns out in my favor I&#39;m buying back in the beginning of May. Good luck to all of you holding it still. If the merger goes through everyone will be rewarded at some point but the guys at Tuscan are really suspect imo.,2021-04-28T18:01:57Z
$PKKFF Bodes well with Peak&#39;s partnership with ShopEx:

$PKKFF  I saw this post on Yahoo board , not verified by me but the guy seams solid.

 Guy is called James

I did some investigating and spoke to Mark from MZ on the phone yesterday. He said it is not them asking for the delay in news. It&#39;s all due to the regulators going over the PP. I spoke to the Ontario regulator and the service line explained that she can&#39;t give me any specific information but said it is very normal for there to be several weeks of delays with PPs.

We should expect financials by the 30th unless an extension is granted. So everyone sit tight and remember nothing has changed with the company. It&#39;s still priced in at the level of Q3 earnings.,2021-04-28T10:11:35Z

$PKKFF Count down begins, within the next 48 hours we should be getting some type of update or numbers for Q4. Don&#39;t let the Market Makers steal your shares they are trying desperately to push this down and selling amongst themselves before our run up. GLTA!,2021-04-27T12:17:22Z

$PKKFF Looks like we have firm support at 2.29 now. Need to get that NASDAQ news this week though, or at least an explanation from the company for why it&#39;s taking so long.,2021-04-26T20:27:06Z

$PKKFF still not really sure how they will make money,2021-04-26T17:36:52Z
$PKKFF As the saying goes, you can bring a horse to water but you can&#39;t make them drink. No worries though, there will be a herd coming soon and many will try and get a few sips if they can!,2021-04-26T17:13:15Z

$PKKFF  Should see closing of the PP and Q4 earnings this week (deadline is Friday). After that, the &#39;dominoes&#39; will fall quickly.,2021-04-26T13:22:06Z
$PKKFF Anyone know if April 29th is the deadline for q4 earnings?,2021-04-26T00:44:20Z
$PKKFF Watch how $MMEDF behaves in the next few days after it announced NASDAQ uplisting approval, we will have the repeat here soon. I own both.,2021-04-25T17:10:54Z
$PKKFF What I&#39;m going to do once TNT makes me rich ( oh yes I can dream )

G rated version =

I quit my job and finally have time to do all those things on my bucket list. Beefing up my existing hobbies and adding new ones. Traveling more with no set time limit I have to be back for.

  Get that little house on a lake with a dock and boat. Take a few courses in collage out of interest and who cares if I pass or not.

X rated version =

  Get a penthouse suite set up complete with a champagne filled hot tub, king size bed covered in cash and enough booze to give a small country alcohol poisoning. 

   During the party a helicopter shows up and drops off some crazy rock band and they crank it up.

  After 40 hours or so the place is littered with trashed furniture and passed out naked people when I awake and I have a coffee overlooking the city :),2021-04-25T10:32:47Z
