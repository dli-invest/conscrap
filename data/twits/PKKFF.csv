$PKKFF Can anyone here confirm Peak is to release their Q1 by end of May? Thanks,2021-05-22T00:30:44Z
$PKKFF   This board is a perfect example of how under the radar this company is flying. When the offering is closed and all the reports come out this will start to get more notice. Then it’s going to make us some bank!,2021-05-21T22:11:42Z

$PKKFF $UPST on fire and up almost 250% year to date. A foreshadowing of things to come for Peak. And, why it’s wise to be early here before the fireworks begin/Nasdaq uplisting.,2021-05-20T15:22:59Z

$IDKFF I would pick $IDKFF over $VSQTF any day of the week. Copied from someone on the discord:

Insane YoY and quarterly growth for $IDKFF. NAV increased from 29.3m at 31 Dec to 57.3m at 31 March, a 95% gain. Pretty much flat during the months March and April, even though growth stocks were crushed. Currently trading at a 0.6 multiple to 30 April NAV per share (68% upside to reach NAV). Taking into account the current discount, the fact that some of its holdings were hit pretty hard in March and April (e.g. $SXOOF and $BTCWF), upcoming catalysts for certain holdings (e.g. $PKKFF) and some of the private holdings going public this year, I&#39;d say there is quite the disconnect between SP and value here...,2021-05-18T14:00:12Z

$PKKFF where is NASDAQ listing?,2021-05-17T16:45:55Z
$PKKFF   I’m as long as most and very, very optimistic about Peaks short, mid and long term prospects; however. those guys at StockFam are great at reading and regurgitating a PR, have  no inside info and frankly are nothing but a hype machine.   They along with the discord crowd have missed on every projection during this quiet period.  makes you wonder if they are traders or investors. 

You need patience and an understanding that regulatory bodies move at their own speed.  

Great things will happen for this company but don’t rely on a message board or a youtube channel for investment advice.  Pure speculation! 

Most traders get burned by the MMs and instys hawking for blood.  If you are long and committed to the company leadership and strategy, remain
patient.  

Good luck,2021-05-17T16:27:08Z
