$PKKFF Does anyone have a link to any information on Zhongke Software Intelligence Ltd, a company Peak is working on to acquire? ?,2021-09-05T19:26:34Z
$PKKFF  BP as a possible international business partner and is a business partner with Union Pay. Let that sink in as to where we are going,2021-09-05T19:25:51Z
$PKKFF Happy Sunday Peak Fam!  For months Peakâ€™s SP declined this spring, now we are on the other side watching this stock appreciate on positive news/fundamentals.  So when people are bashing just smile and wave, let JJ &amp; team execute - We will be ok!!!!! ðŸ§¨,2021-09-05T19:01:13Z
$PKKFF Arcticyclown you look so ridiculous being bearish and bashing a stock that on last Friday became a Unicorn stock ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,2021-09-05T18:40:50Z
$PKKFF a few bears on this board but not one has presented a scintilla of logic as to why they are bearish. One of them obviously doesnâ€™t know how to read an income statement n a couple others either sold out too early and/or missed out on the tremendous SP run. Either way, it makes literally no difference what they say. Peak is firing on all cylinders n the SP reflects it. The revenue growth alone is propelling this thing higher, n their future business expansion is compelling.,2021-09-05T18:35:03Z

$PKKFF welp. Doesnâ€™t make sense. Gonna unwatch cause itâ€™s just adding insult to injury.,2021-09-05T17:52:48Z
$PKKFF I think 130-150M in revenue is a realistic target for this year. I can see 45M in Q3 and 60M in Q4 which would put us at around 150M (best case scenario of course) . Assuming we hit that number, what is your YE price target ?,2021-09-05T16:47:16Z
$PKKFF,2021-09-05T16:44:00Z
$PKKFF What do you think about the profit/loss per share figure of 0.000? And the net figures for the non controlling interest (315k) in comparison to the owner of the parent, Peak (-19k)?,2021-09-05T16:42:54Z

$PKKFF peak are expecting 100k businesses signed up to the hub by end of q3. How many did they at start of year and how many do we expect by eoy??,2021-09-05T11:40:14Z
$PKKFF Probably old news to the regulars here but Peak apparently signed an agreement with Italian retailer Gruppo Coin in 2020. 

https://m.insidertracking.com/peak-signs-agreement-with-italian-retailer-gruppo-coin-to-help-finance-online-sales-in-china

Even older news which some might find interesting...Gruppo hasn&#39;t existed as a company   since late 2018. 

https://it.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruppo_Coin

Strangely enough if you decide to do your DD and check the company out using the link from the first news release, it takes you to a website with, let&#39;s not be too harsh, not the best design or functionality:

https://en.coin.it/

Alternatively you could visit this site with a curiously similar name which seems much easier to use and you could even make a purchase if you fancy. The only downside is that you can&#39;t translate it to Chinese. :)

$PKKFF my Opinion about articyam is he/she invested in peak back in March and the stock dropped 40% in that 3 months quite period and he/she sold for a loss and is angry now the stock has run up so much.  We have all been there before, selling a stock for a loss only to see it run.  This is why knowing the company is so important when your investing.  During that 3 month quite period I was also down over 40% as well but instead of selling I dollar cost averaged down and lowered my cost basis but if I wasnâ€™t convinced in the company I could see how people would sell.  You gotta let it go man. There is still good money to be made here. Itâ€™s not to late for you.   I say all of this honestly and sincerely. You have a company here growing revenue over 300% YOY which is mind blowing.,2021-09-05T00:25:43Z

$PKKFF ðŸš¨ PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD GUYS. KEEP THIS STOCK OFF OF REDDIT SUBREDDITS. EVERYTHING THEY TOUCH TURNS INTO CANCER. 

Let them chase organically down the line. Itâ€™ll eventually get there,2021-09-04T21:54:29Z
$PKKFF ignore bears. Know what you hold. Accumulate and accumulate until you canâ€™t accumulate no more. 

Iâ€™m holding through all of the price action till at least 2026

Iâ€™ve been swindled out of shares in the past trying to be a trader. Iâ€™ve learned patience is the most valuable thing if youâ€™re an active investor. Iâ€™m not gonna watch graphs. I trust my research and let my money ACTUALLY work for me,2021-09-04T21:52:35Z
