$PKKFF canâ€™t buy this on webull or Robinhood until uplisting, once it does it would get more eyes, i was watching last few days it didnâ€™t havea red day, i want it to load it but I canâ€™t ðŸ˜¢,2021-08-17T04:05:39Z
$PKKFF planning on buying this tomorrow, whatâ€™s the PT for u guys making this a 2-3 week play until nasdaq listing,2021-08-17T02:15:25Z
$PKKFF  The reason Iâ€™m bullish on Canadian stocks is because the tail end of my construction career I noticed it wasnâ€™t isolated Instances,I was confronted by a whole generation of thin skinned,poor workethic,entitled,mommyfied,drug addled,near brain dead work force.25 and donâ€™t know how to operate a shovel?The dumbing down,brain washing,and softening of an entire generation isnâ€™t by accident and itâ€™s very sad.All the more reason my early retirement is #1 on my priority list.,2021-08-17T02:12:44Z

$BYFC  
I love seeing the #Investblack initiative doing well. #CARV &amp; BYFC leading the pack!   BYFC since the merger has really gain momentum!   other black owned or black ran companies are doing their thing in 2021 

Black Founders &amp; CEOs: 
$PKKFF - Peak Fintech (A.I. b2b lending /business hub ) 
$PAVM - PAVmed Inc (throat cancer detection device)
 $PDSB - PDS Biotechnology Corp (immunotherapy cancer biotech)
 

Other Black Banks also doing their thing on the OTC: 
- $CZBS
- $MFBP
- $HRBK
- $IBWC
 
Then there are companies that focus on black people themselves:

There really are some pretty amazing tech/fintech/resources companies coming out of canada. Many got overpumped out of the gates and are now getting their mojo back.

I bought into a bunch of them in spring/summer 2020 - $FOBIF $EPWCF $PKKFF $IDKFF and others.

- Fobi went nuts first and looks to be going that way again soon - monster upside. Will get bought out for big money.

- Peak is about as blue chip as an undiscovered company gets. Nasdaq uplist imminent. Just turned their biggest risk into a strength with their Cubelo acquisition

- Empower went bananas and then fell apart but if you have patience they will get back up there

- Threed is a good etf like vehicle to buy into a host of penny tech and resources companjes at the same time. CEO is a bit dodgy but that doesn&#39;t stop him being right a lot. 

Any more i should have on my radar in a similar vein?,2021-08-17T01:37:50Z
$Pkkff when are they announcing q2 results?,2021-08-17T01:27:17Z
$PKKFF I&#39;m contemplating liquidating everything else and putting it in this ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†,2021-08-17T01:14:22Z
$PKKFF The reality is if institutions or funds are starting to buy, which appears so given the control of the price and the fact that they arenâ€™t going to sell 3 days later but rather hold for years unlike most emotional retail , then Iâ€™d imagine buying will continue for a while. Most educated investors probably donâ€™t care whether they get this for $7 or $15 because they understand valuation and know where this is going. Some people on this board only know AMC and GME , hype pump and dumps, so they think if something goes up too fast it has to go all the way down just as fast (but my crayon linez told me!), but the reality is they have never found a good company before Wall Street has had a chance to buy in (almost 0% tute ownership here) and donâ€™t understand what kind of buying pressure that can bring over the coming months / years as these firms who do actual financial analysis bring Peak up to a fair valuation.,2021-08-17T00:05:16Z
$PKKFF I told some friends to come over here and read this thread are you guys here?,2021-08-16T23:35:08Z
$PKKFF,2021-08-16T23:11:23Z
$BRGGD I put my balls on the line for this company at one time,made a few bucks but that R/S was total B.S,I switched to $PKKFF luckily at the right moment on some Russian Roulette win or die shit,but I swear I had all me chips on Bragg from .45 to 2ish,thought I found the lost ark of the covenant ,FN idiot I was,is,2021-08-16T22:49:30Z
$PKKFF I keep buying as the share price goes up and not selling til we hit $150.,2021-08-16T22:45:45Z
$PKKFF 
Ha-ha.....I know we are blowing up but damn TD....control yourself Bro!,2021-08-16T22:33:46Z
$PKKFF damn. This bitch just keeps going,2021-08-16T22:14:45Z
$PKKFF 
Do you guys know when itâ€™s gonna list on the nasdaq?,2021-08-16T21:48:16Z
$PKKFF The news today was HUGE btw. Tonight folks dipping their toes here recently and digesting the ramifications may want to put their feet in now, lol
Tomorrow I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if we have a 20% day. :-)
Have a good evening.,2021-08-16T21:25:36Z
$PKKFF is this too hot?  Yes.  But it will have legs to continue if theres 20 more news releases in the queue.  It&#39;s still undervalued of you use the upst multiples.....,2021-08-16T21:19:26Z
$PKKFF all this talk about charts, and RSI, and pullbacks and whatever other acronyms out there. I know nothing about charts.  All I know is the stock should be $14 as soon as it hits Nasdaq.  If the fomo kicks in hard it will be at $20  EOY. If they hit revenue and exceed expectations $40 next year. $75-$100 in 2023.  Again this coming from a dumb dumb who invested in peak 9 months ago with 49,000 shares at $4.00 average post split. This recent run up hasnâ€™t even got the stock to a fair value yet.  
Always remember You create wealth through long term investing . When you find a wealth creator stock like peak they will say you are wrong. When you hold one they will say you are stupid. When you get rich they will say you got lucky. Gotta love being wrong, stupid, and lucky,2021-08-16T21:10:23Z
$PKKFF strong close near the high of the day. Stay focused on the fundamentals and not the price if you are a long term investor (as I am). I see this being bigger than UPST as B2B is better than consumer in Fintech space. It wonâ€™t happen overnight, but many multi millionaires will be made here.,2021-08-16T20:19:55Z
$PKKFF not too shabby here aye...,2021-08-16T20:18:13Z
$PKKFF if you are only buying for green days, you probably should be in a MF, better yet, some bonds.

Another strong day, congrats to all.,2021-08-16T20:05:52Z
$PKKFF well, I thought I was buying 200 more shares. But my $1700 deposit to Ameritrade is still on hold. Which is odd,  my previous deposits transferred right away,2021-08-16T19:42:44Z
$PKKFF Wow! I&#39;m as bullish as anyone but holy shit this is over extended, would be really healthy for it to consolidate a bit here before the next move up. The RSI is at 93 and the harder they rise without consolidation the faster they fall cause of no support levels.,2021-08-16T19:38:38Z
$PKKFF Literally salivating at the thought of this hitting NASDAQ and volume just skyrockets ðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆ,2021-08-16T19:04:07Z
$PKKFF Trend is your Friend. Hold tight!,2021-08-16T19:02:11Z
$PKKFF This ticker is a beast,2021-08-16T18:53:29Z
$PKKFF Finally hit $11 CDN - People would be stupid to do another massive sell off at this time. Acquisition + up-listing in the next week or two.,2021-08-16T18:46:29Z
$PKKFF this is my happy place...,2021-08-16T18:35:44Z
