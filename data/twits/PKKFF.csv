$PKKFF big things coming before the end of the month!,2021-05-24T21:23:23Z
$CATV   Hey guys. You know I‚Äôm long and strong CATV but you have to look at $PKKFF.  130 million SO, 263 million market cap and 100 million+ expected revenues this year. Way undervalued. May do a RS as they uplist to Nas but don‚Äôt let that scare you. Want a comparison look at $UPST @ $139.,2021-05-24T20:42:48Z
$PKKFF shoutout to our US friends...well done today!,2021-05-24T20:04:30Z

$PKKFF   I would suggest selling something if you have to but own all the shares you want in this stock by Friday. I would suspect all this to start coming out next Monday.,2021-05-23T22:27:36Z

$PKKFF  I went back through the monthly reports and highlighted some of the more important topics being questioned on ST. Profitability, uplisting, stock split, etc. There are a number of huge announcements about to blow this wide open. Get ready for the dominoes to start falling!!

$PKKFF Can anyone here confirm Peak is to release their Q1 by end of May? Thanks,2021-05-22T00:30:44Z
$PKKFF   This board is a perfect example of how under the radar this company is flying. When the offering is closed and all the reports come out this will start to get more notice. Then it‚Äôs going to make us some bank!,2021-05-21T22:11:42Z
