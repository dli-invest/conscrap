im holding through the storm because i believe sunlight is just around the corner. A few years back we almost lost my boy Noah. At that time I was working 12hr days seven days a week. made me realize how precious and fragile life is and started my road to financially independents from the rat race. Anyway what’s your inspiration?,2021-08-18T01:22:06Z
$PKKFF It’s gonna be bloody tomorrow For this stock,2021-08-18T01:20:36Z
$PKKFF I’m all for Fintech,why should credit worthy people that pay all their bills on time be  hit with obscene interest rates? If not only you have a great credit score but have also been trustworthy with using a Fintech/AI enhanced platform then why shouldn’t you be connected to a vast network of banks and pick the one that gives you the power of getting the very best rate possible?How about a safe savings account thats imbedded into the pool of money that actually pays a decent interest rate,You know like what banks used to do until they got addicted to getting near zero blocks of digital cash and shylocking it out 10-30%.,2021-08-17T23:58:55Z
$PKKFF nothing has changed with the company fundamentally today. To be honest it should of been down yesterday with the acquisition of cubeler.  don’t forget the stock market is an irrational being and us as individuals are too emotional. sit back and laugh tonight. Watch a comedy Sakdos got me thinking about airplane After his GIf,2021-08-17T23:19:55Z

$PKKFF instead of doing my DD, I&#39;m going to believe the account that was created today who bought at an all time high, got burned and now trying to make everyone else sell. I&#39;m convinced!,2021-08-17T21:06:50Z

$PKKFF block @umer2233 and move on. This idiot is a douchebag,2021-08-17T20:08:46Z
$PKKFF even though we pulled back today I&#39;m still happy. It was needed tbh probably a bit too much at one point (20%) 😯 but recovered a little bit. And it gave new investors the chance to get on board. 

Attracting a few bears which is always a sign people want in cheaper, can&#39;t flipping blame them this is a 💎.
 
Nasdaq soon which should be exciting..🤑🤑,2021-08-17T20:07:10Z
$PKKFF PKKFF IS GONNA GO ON THE NASDAQ- SOURCE: Trust me bro,2021-08-17T19:48:07Z

$PKKFF Sold other stocks that started to consolidate and bought more PKK. Looking forward to December, when I’ll be thinking how smart it was to buy more under $10. Giddy giddy giddy. Thanks for the drop.,2021-08-17T19:46:44Z
$PKKFF watch for more news tomorrow. Will it be Nasdaq?,2021-08-17T19:45:37Z
$PKKFF If you are phasing your way into a long position you live for days like this.,2021-08-17T19:45:05Z
$PKKFF I had no extra cash so I “wrote” calls on my riot and spce shares to collect the premium to buy more peak:-),2021-08-17T19:13:27Z
$PKKFF seems like a bunch on new bear profiles have just been created in the last 24hours. Don&#39;t listen to the noise. Just block and move on. This is so undervalued it&#39;s a joke. In case you&#39;re curious, look at the bearish posts profiles date created, and you&#39;ll understand. The fun is just beginning folks,2021-08-17T19:12:28Z
$PKKFF haha rollercoaster time,2021-08-17T19:11:52Z
