Kind of a non-event report this time, but there is still some interesting stuff. Nothing new about the talk of partnerships but to remind us of the massive potential there is this. Let this sink in!,2021-06-08T01:53:16Z

$PKKFF  Been going a bit squirrely over the last year of lock down and  watching my stocks everyday.  Especially the shorts ,,  been gnawing away at my patience too.

  Ok  ,,,,  going to try not to look at my folio or chat rooms for an entire day on Monday, wish me luck  lol,2021-06-05T09:35:18Z
$PKKFF Picked up 2k more shares, have a great weekend see you guys next weeküòé,2021-06-04T19:44:52Z
$PKKFF   my take, the delay in the PP and financial restatements has set the company back a bit; esp for Nasdaq.  

I‚Äôll go a step further and state that IMO the nasdaq folks have told them the uplist needs a NA based revenue model, as well.  Just too much China hate these days.  Hence, the fast track for NA deployment.

Think the PP will close soon, deals will be announced and the company will pursue NA deployment ASAP.

Russel reconstitution is May/June and I don‚Äôt think Peak has any chance to make it.  That‚Äôs a big miss IMO.  

To me, company was over exhuberant and I put that on its advisors/BOD.  They have made some good hires along the way so need to give it time.  Q4 should see huge run in share price and next year could be parabolic.  

IMo, this is a buy/accumulate/hold stock.  Could run to double at any moment on a bit of news.  I‚Äôve got FV at year end with 65M US revenue pegged at MC abt 1B or abt 4x from here.

Good luck!,2021-06-04T17:46:55Z

$PKKFF  the folks in control like to hammer your confidence.  the most challenging time to hold is during a dark period.  in this case waiting for regulatory approval.

follow your conviction, timing the market is for the those that move the market.    those reddit/wsb stocks are analogous to a pyramid scheme, imo.   there is no compelling fundamental or growth story behind them.

as an ‚Äúinvestor‚Äù
you need to understand it‚Äôs ok to sacrifice short term opportunity cost for long term prosperity.  no one knows when news will break or when the manipulators will capture their intended shares snd the algos will reverse.,2021-06-03T15:41:12Z
$PKKFF They are making partnerships, want to making things right, and overall, buisness is working well even with the pandemic... Bullish of course.,2021-06-03T14:37:38Z
$PKKFF Remember all, when buying a stock, you are investing in a business. This business is so wonderful, so the lower the stock price, the more you can own of that business, the more exciting it is!,2021-06-03T14:36:57Z
$PKKFF I am very patient but seriously, the Titanic took longer to sink.  If things are looking great and the forecast is very favourable it sure isn‚Äôt reflecting that in the market.  I‚Äôm still bullish but I am also waning.,2021-06-03T13:48:55Z
$PKKFF  I wonder how many stop loss automatic sells got triggered today,seems the MM,s are testing everyday for cheap shares to resell later for a profit,2021-06-03T13:39:22Z
$PKKFF All is good here guys and gals. By the end of 2021, I do believe we&#39;ll look back on this delay in closing the offering as a blessing in disguise. Long term holders are holding strong, and mean time, JJ and team are still executing, generating revenue, raising capital, adding talent, rolling out in NA, and overall positioning Peak to be much more attractive than it was a few months ago for big investors. 

Going on Nasdaq a few months ago may have been a flop, without all the other pieces put together. Look at MNMD (mindmed) for example. There were not other catalysts at the time of uplist, it spiked for a day or two, and is back down to where it was before uplist. I really like Peak&#39;s trajectory right now, but have paaaaaaatience. Lots of patience.,2021-06-03T12:44:58Z

$PKKFF  um , I watched a Scotia algorithm short the fuck out of Peak today. Walls consisting of 20 ,  4k share blocks on buys and sells.  When there is low volume they activate. No, there wasn&#39;t any panic selling today , in fact there was low volume because no one was selling ,, but  ,,  also  no new buyers either. Need new volume.,2021-06-03T09:18:32Z
