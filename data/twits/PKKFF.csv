$PKKFF Re-watched the Rob Tetrault interview with JJ.  What jumped out to me was JJ‚Äôs favourite quote‚Ä¶ must be a secret message for investing in Peak üòâ,2021-07-31T00:14:24Z

$PKKFF As we get more folks here it will be good to post some DD/ info of this gem. I know most here now go somewhere else to get their info but new investors will be clueless. So some of the old postings could be repost or updated would be great. Once people realize the hours/ days of research/ DD most have done on this company they will realize 99% of the questions/ objections have been answered already. Have a good weekend all!,2021-07-30T20:50:11Z
$PKKFF Just wanna say I&#39;m a fan of this board.  I&#39;ve been through this a couple times with small companies and when they get large and/or noticed it makes you miss these days haha.  Looking forward to the future for Peak/TNT but I&#39;ll miss the usefulness and simplicity in about 3 months haha.,2021-07-30T20:33:23Z
$PKKFF This company is a Disrupter in the Fintech business. When they go to Nasdaq the institutions will  take notice. With their tech and networking everyone is going to be wanting to transact B to B loans globally. Just scratching the service at these prices. INSANLEY undervalued when you do comps.,2021-07-30T20:26:47Z
$PKKFF Congrats longs, nearing ATH again. Next week is going to be bonkers with Nasdaq uplist announcement. Ton of NRs coming in the following weeks, including an upward revision of the already AMAZING revenue forecast when they acquire Cubeler and expand to NA before the end of the year. The current forecast is based on China ONLY (confirmed by the CEO).,2021-07-30T20:08:38Z
$PKKFF average up day for me.,2021-07-30T19:56:04Z
$PKKFF Fidelity was very responsive to our concerns about the &#39;foreign transaction fee&#39; for PKKFF after the split. They will be adjusting it tonight.,2021-07-30T19:55:13Z
$PKKFF nice job today guys,2021-07-30T19:31:00Z

$PKKFF boom!! 4.87!!!! This is just the start!!,2021-07-30T17:44:34Z
$PKKFF I just got off the phone with Vanguard... I purchased shares the day after the R/S but they split those shares anyway... When I called them they basically told me that there may be a discrepancy and to check back in a week... Anyone trade on Vanguard? Anyone purchase on the 28th having the same issue? I told customer service there&#39;s no way I would purchase shares that haven&#39;t been split at a post split price as I&#39;m needlessly paying double! I feel very disappointed in their response...,2021-07-30T16:54:46Z

$PKKFF once the trading platforms get it together this will start making some moves,2021-07-30T16:04:58Z
$PKKFF 4.20 yesterday, 4.69 today. I like this price action üòé,2021-07-30T16:02:36Z
$PKKFF Patience is paying off for the Peak family.  To think the Nasdaq uplist is just weeks away and yet we are still flying under the radar of institution investment. IMO good times but we must continue to execute QoQ! üß®üß®,2021-07-30T15:51:24Z

$PKKFF This price action bodes well, more PRs next week and beyond. More and more eyes finally understanding this Fintech is the real deal and highly undervalued.,2021-07-30T15:31:25Z
