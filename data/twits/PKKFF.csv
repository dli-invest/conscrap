I last posted about $PKKFF in March! As we come into 8 weeks without any informative NRs, let’s think back to the busier months of December, January, and February. Talk about a potential backlog! Going to be reading NRs all summer long at this rate 😂,2021-05-06T02:23:26Z
$PKKFF according to the latest Yahoo article a reverse split is coming. 2:1 or 5:1. A RS is never good,2021-05-05T19:43:01Z
$PKKFF I keep hearing nasdaq, but this has to be over 4 to be listed. So is a RS in our future?,2021-05-05T13:59:13Z
$PKKFF  This is by far the strongest stock I have ever owned. Horrible markets affecting hundreds of stocks??  LOL  No problem :P,2021-05-05T06:31:36Z
$PKKFF Anyone else concerned that if the broader market does have a serious pullback, this will get dragged down too? Before it was just growth stocks that were dropping, now it&#39;s everything other than the re-opening plays. It only takes one whale to cause a major drop.,2021-05-04T22:47:30Z

$PKKFF  Did a little more reading into the cost of service issue. It is my understanding that gold river wasn&#39;t fully active until mid q4 so the improvement may not really be noticed quite yet. 

   IMO  , They will continue to streamline and add features to further cut down on outsourcing etc. as time unfolds.

 I took this clip from Globe and mail as well, it is as follows..

Peak was also able to improve the profit margins of its supply-chain financing service bundle and realize important savings on cost of service expenses during the quarter as more and more supply-chain financing related services previously outsourced to third-parties were shifted to the Company&#39;s Gold River platform.,2021-05-03T22:49:00Z
$MNKD $PKKFF Mannkind family meet peak family:-) I don’t think we’re getting bought out yet, but if we do you might consider moving some of your profits over to peak. Just get on the thread and do your own DD. One of our longtime friends is very bullish on the company. https://twitter.com/lochlynmunro/status/1389029906823094277?s=21,2021-05-03T22:37:40Z

$PKKFF feels like this won’t budge until nasdaq.,2021-05-03T13:31:14Z
$PKKFF There is a lot to unpack in the MD&amp;A, but a new and exciting development is the possibility of partnering with a Chinese fintech looking for exposure to the capital markets. 

&quot;As of the date of this MD&amp;A, the Company had already been approached by one such Chinese Fintech whose offering would be complementary to the Company’s Lending Hub ecosystem&quot;,2021-05-03T12:35:03Z
$PKKFF    Don&#39;t forget the covid too , although peak was able to make money working with companies support, overall business has been DOWN. I expect this to further add even more tailwinds to peak as the economy is going to start looking a lot better moving forward, especially into 2022 :)    Just a thought :),2021-05-03T10:15:49Z
