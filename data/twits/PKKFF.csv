$PKKFF Happy 4th  US !!!

The Boston Tea Party was a political protest that occurred on December 16, 1773, at Griffin&#39;s Wharf in Boston, Massachusetts. American colonists, frustrated and angry at Britain for imposing “taxation without representation,” dumped 342 chests of tea, imported by the British East India Company into the harbor.,2021-07-05T03:26:25Z

$PKKFF LOL  Looks like the coward Rfogg615  blocked me after my response to his bashing left him clueless.  Hard to wrap my head around why people act like infantile little babies  trolling chat boards etc.,2021-07-04T16:49:36Z
$PKKFF Scam stock as predicted.,2021-07-04T13:41:41Z
$PKKFF if peak doesn’t own cubeler yet which means they can’t use it outside of China currently why are the raising money in this offering and stating expansion to NA and Europe.  Technically until they own cubeler there is no expansion possible.,2021-07-04T00:12:03Z

$PKKFF are we sure there is going to be a R/S and if so when?,2021-07-03T04:15:09Z
$PKKFF There is a lot of noise here because of the news vacuum created by the closing offering. Relax. The company revenue fundamentals have not changed. Healthy growth always succeeds. Patience.,2021-07-03T02:48:47Z
$PKKFF way too much koolaid on this board, must be the discord bs has invaded stocktwits. 

no seasoned investor / trader or anyone with a bit of common sense could even begin to
imagine peak paying a dividend in the near future. this is business not an entitlement program.  

can’t imagine anyone here actually bought for a dividend, expects a dividend  or wants a dividend at this juncture l

flat out, this a spec otc growth play.  business model in china looks fantastic.  operating in china as na company is tenuous; esp now with Xi latest proclamation.  e and na and row growth strategy needs funding and people and balance sheet needs fortifying.

im sorry but investing in these type stocks is not for the feint of heart, csn be zero-sum and there are always unforeseen external/internal factors that can roadblock plans.

think we are all waiting patiently, let’s see what happens in next few weeks.  

if someone wants a few  dividend paying stocks let me know.,2021-07-02T22:55:35Z

$PKKFF Figured I would copy what I just added on Discord!

Loved how JJ started the AGM presentation yesterday “As you all know, we have high expectations for 2021 &amp; a number of very exciting things we want to accomplish before the end of the year”. 

Other then getting straight to his Magnificent 7 topics… one big takeaway was JJ’s Cuberler vision:  He stated: Cuberler is essentially an ecosystem and we are building a global network of small businesses owners that can interact with each other and network among each other, literally linking SMEs from Canada, US, Europe, and China.  So Cuberler is like a dating app matching millions of potential businesses and collecting various service fees for providing critical business data along the way!

see p8/p9.  the level of qualification determines the criteria.  If Peak pursues qualifying under MV approach, there is a 90 day requirement to have stock over 4.

So JJ indicated they needed price above 4, what standard are they applying under?,2021-07-01T06:47:41Z
