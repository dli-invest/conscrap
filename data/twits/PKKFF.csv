$PKKFF slowly accumulating shares..  next entry will be ~$1.7 range if it ever hit there.,2021-07-22T01:12:16Z
$PKKFF I cannot find a specific UPLISTING date?

Anyone know?

So this will be the UPST of China... Essentially?

Any other DD or details greatly appreciated.

Has been on my Radar for along time. No Trigger Pull.

With uplisting... Would hope it does not do what $MNMD did.

Will pay close attention over the next day or 2. ,2021-07-21T22:00:14Z
$PKKFF any clue on when options will be available after the uplisting? Does it just depend on the trading volume? It‚Äôs currently averaging 313,082 shares traded. Gotta get the word out about $PKKFF,2021-07-21T21:11:51Z
$PKKFF I¬¥ll join you guys this week! Very excited about this stock!

Shout-out to jrockford, thanks to his watchlist I was able to find this gem.,2021-07-21T20:55:38Z

$PKKFF anyone know why webull has peak at a market cap of 1.48billion???,2021-07-21T19:39:45Z
$PKKFF What I know today is: We are on par with Upstart‚Äôs revenue forecast and will likely overtake them in 2025 in USD and are trading 60x lower - INCREDIBLE VALUE PROPOSITION!!!   

You do the math - Beautiful days ahead Peak Fam üö®,2021-07-21T18:18:16Z
$PKKFF Good advice form JStocks.   Remember, this is trading on the OTC and is ripe for manipulation.   Despite what some others may say, the uplist to Nasdaq is the key catalyst to give the company the street cred it needs.  The forecast was over the top and should tell you something where this company is headed.   IMO, there are forces keeping the price down right now so MMs can accumulate for benefactors and to make a market.   Remember, the OS shares will be halved and demand could be great. 

For short term thinkers - - -Should it be higher?  Y   Can it go higher?  Y  Will it go higher?  Maybe 

For long term thinkiers  - - Remain patient.  Accumulate if you can.   Expect news pre and post Nasdaq.   MZ was hired to help and they need and will earn their keep.  

The question you should ask yourself.   Knowing that the stock is immensely undervalued, can you afford to be on the sidelines when those in control of the selling price, decide to let it rip higher?

Good luck,2021-07-21T18:07:45Z
$PKKFF Guys it‚Äôs like GEVO last year did a raise at $1.20 and proceeded to trade sideways for a month or so until it didn‚Äôt and shot to $15+ in a matter of weeks.  What I‚Äôm saying is ignore the daily stock price movement and let this play out. Peak has so many catalysts coming, stop commenting on why it‚Äôs dropping - it‚Äôs the stock market and we are still impacted by retail penny flippers and day traders.  If you have invested in Peak, you know it will change soon enough!!!  GLTA üß®üß®üß®,2021-07-21T17:09:32Z
$PKKFF anyone know why it‚Äôs dropping today?,2021-07-21T16:54:16Z
$PKKFF I couldn&#39;t imagine selling for pennies when we know what&#39;s going to be coming in future.,2021-07-21T16:38:22Z

IMO .. As traders we are now at an inflection point..  For months our FA has ruled the decisions.. hold hold hold ..  and it was the right move.

Now we are in TA territory, and this chart is classic.  Prepare for volatility and swings on the road up up and away!,2021-07-21T15:35:59Z
$PKKFF good to see the $2.50 CAD support held up - the RSI had a chance to cool off and the MACD is curling back up again. Getting ready to launch again!,2021-07-21T14:53:16Z

$PKKFF Peak Fintech (soon to be uplisted to the Nasdaq and rebranded to Tenet) same 2023 net income projection as $UPST, but valued at 1/30 of $UPST&#39;s current 6bn market cap.

$UPST Is $PKKFF the new Upstart with ground floor entry opportunity?,2021-07-21T10:35:51Z
$PKKFF  Was expecting some profit taking at some point on this mega spike (lot of buying around 2 bucks CAD).  Gaps filled, looking good.,2021-07-21T06:01:10Z
$PKKFF,2021-07-20T21:45:15Z
$PKKFF  OMG‚Ä¶ check out Upstart‚Äôs revenue and net income compared to Peak.  PEAK has one hell of a bright future with UPST currently trading at $115 USD today and hit a high of $192 USD and we are at $2 USD!  Wait till the market wakes up to PKKFF/TNT!!!! üíéüß®üí∞,2021-07-20T20:16:31Z
