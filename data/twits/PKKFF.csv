$PKKFF @croaker95: ya no way will
the Chinese communist party let a foreign company operating in China get that big. Just like they crushed Apple, Nike, Tesla, Starbucks, etc. Ya these billion dollar foreign companies are almost broke because of the CCP. If ur gonna bash Peak, at least make an argument that makes some sense .,2021-08-14T04:38:57Z
$PKKFF for new investors who are interested in a treasure trove of due diligence and ongoing astute analysis on Peak - soon to be TNT on the Nasdaq. I am thinking we‚Äôll be officially unlisted sometime this week. CEO recently said sometime this month. üß®

$SESN hard lesson for SESN investors today. Stop putting your money in pre-revenue hype micro caps. Rather, invest in micro caps that are under the radar and have a solid foundation including revenue and scalability. $PKKFF is a good example.,2021-08-14T02:54:33Z

$ABML Great time to keep laddering in next few months prior to construction. Will slow leak until more big news and the swings jump back in. Next Gap up should be big. 2X-3X easily. Hopefully over $5. Just go look at $PKKFF as an example,2021-08-14T00:02:57Z
$PKKFF the first page and last page (DD corner with Mike Hardy) are devoted to Peak!
