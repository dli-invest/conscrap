$PKKFF Another interesting Pinduoduo post from the Stock Fam discord.  Can you see where Peak Fintech fits in? üòú

https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/30/2220568/0/en/Pinduoduo-deepens-digital-transformation-for-agriculture-by-connecting-millions-of-farmers-to-consumers.html

Pinduoduo has gone from zero to almost 800 million customers in just six years, making it one of the fastest-growing consumer internet companies in the world. The company has described its model as ‚ÄúCostco + Disney‚Äù, in reference to the combination of value-for-money offerings and entertainment. It is unique among other large internet companies to make digitizing the agriculture industry a core, strategic priority.

Under its ‚ÄúInternet + Agriculture‚Äù strategy, Pinduoduo coached farmers on setting up stores online, provided them with access to end demand, and helped them to increase their household income.

I LOVE PEAK ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,2021-04-30T12:59:26Z

$PKKFF I‚Äôm excited that tomorrow is finally our day for Q4 2020 numbers.  I‚Äôm guessing management was holding off to see the offering would be signed off before releasing them.  It would be great if we could also get the 2021/2022 revised forecast.  Let‚Äôs go Peak‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs blow the doors off! üíéüí∞,2021-04-30T00:32:26Z

$PKKFF (From Jay Jensen post on facebook pkk group). Guys relax. I spoke with Cathy on Monday (regarding something different), but ended up discussing prospectus etc. 
She said they are getting hammered with questions from the regulators about the prospectus, but everything is still happening. Sounds like it ended up being more work than expected and they have no control over the timing after their responses have been made. This is the main issue delaying any additional news.
I agree with Edward Vranic that they need to be better when it comes to announcing FS releases and working with the auditors to ensure these dates are met. However, with regards to other news, NOTHING has changed. The business has been doing amazing, as everyone knows (and also reiterated by Cathy). It&#39;s not their responsibility to continue reminding shareholders that things are okay - and the exact same as previous news releases/reports - just because its taking slightly longer.,2021-04-29T16:27:25Z
$PKKFF hasnt changed at all,2021-04-29T15:46:42Z
$PKKFF Ok I&#39;m ready for this to move up now. Been watching this 2.30 level for over 3 months. Come on.,2021-04-29T14:34:33Z

$THCB I&#39;m being honest. I just sold my 2,000 shares because at this point it seems like dead money. I&#39;m pretty sure that the merger will take place in the middle of May. It seems not too far away for some but looking at $NGA having the merger finally the next few days or $PKKFF releasing guidance for 2021 most likely on Friday it&#39;s far away for me and my speculations. If it turns out in my favor I&#39;m buying back in the beginning of May. Good luck to all of you holding it still. If the merger goes through everyone will be rewarded at some point but the guys at Tuscan are really suspect imo.,2021-04-28T18:01:57Z
$PKKFF Bodes well with Peak&#39;s partnership with ShopEx:

$PKKFF  I saw this post on Yahoo board , not verified by me but the guy seams solid.

 Guy is called James

I did some investigating and spoke to Mark from MZ on the phone yesterday. He said it is not them asking for the delay in news. It&#39;s all due to the regulators going over the PP. I spoke to the Ontario regulator and the service line explained that she can&#39;t give me any specific information but said it is very normal for there to be several weeks of delays with PPs.

We should expect financials by the 30th unless an extension is granted. So everyone sit tight and remember nothing has changed with the company. It&#39;s still priced in at the level of Q3 earnings.,2021-04-28T10:11:35Z
