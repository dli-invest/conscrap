$PKKFF if peak doesn’t own cubeler yet which means they can’t use it outside of China currently why are the raising money in this offering and stating expansion to NA and Europe.  Technically until they own cubeler there is no expansion possible.,2021-07-04T00:12:03Z

$PKKFF are we sure there is going to be a R/S and if so when?,2021-07-03T04:15:09Z
$PKKFF There is a lot of noise here because of the news vacuum created by the closing offering. Relax. The company revenue fundamentals have not changed. Healthy growth always succeeds. Patience.,2021-07-03T02:48:47Z
$PKKFF way too much koolaid on this board, must be the discord bs has invaded stocktwits. 

no seasoned investor / trader or anyone with a bit of common sense could even begin to
imagine peak paying a dividend in the near future. this is business not an entitlement program.  

can’t imagine anyone here actually bought for a dividend, expects a dividend  or wants a dividend at this juncture l

flat out, this a spec otc growth play.  business model in china looks fantastic.  operating in china as na company is tenuous; esp now with Xi latest proclamation.  e and na and row growth strategy needs funding and people and balance sheet needs fortifying.

im sorry but investing in these type stocks is not for the feint of heart, csn be zero-sum and there are always unforeseen external/internal factors that can roadblock plans.

think we are all waiting patiently, let’s see what happens in next few weeks.  

if someone wants a few  dividend paying stocks let me know.,2021-07-02T22:55:35Z

$PKKFF Figured I would copy what I just added on Discord!

Loved how JJ started the AGM presentation yesterday “As you all know, we have high expectations for 2021 &amp; a number of very exciting things we want to accomplish before the end of the year”. 

Other then getting straight to his Magnificent 7 topics… one big takeaway was JJ’s Cuberler vision:  He stated: Cuberler is essentially an ecosystem and we are building a global network of small businesses owners that can interact with each other and network among each other, literally linking SMEs from Canada, US, Europe, and China.  So Cuberler is like a dating app matching millions of potential businesses and collecting various service fees for providing critical business data along the way!

Q&amp;A section - 

- Will you hire a CTO.  Peak has a CTO in China, but by aquiring Cubeler, we are also gaining that knowlege along with the analytics team in Canada.
- Advertising component and networking.  Advertise products and services worldwide. Canada US China Europe. Global network of SMEs.  Financing is limited based on jurisdiction, but networking, advertising, downloading research reports, everything can be accessible to the entire network.
- Minimal impact on the operating results due to delay in financing. 
- Integration with Chinas digital currency. &quot;Yes...things have happened&quot;
- Progress with Digital Currency as well as payment processing functionality with Unionpay.
- Integration with Shopex - &quot;Very Pleased with the integration and revenues have hit Q2&quot;
 

**Overall timeline (As stated by JJ).  Closing of the prospectus at the end of next week.  Consolidation of shares a week or two after that, and then 3-4 weeks for nasdaq uplist.**,2021-07-01T12:22:28Z
$PKKFF   someone asked to buy now or after RS, that’s a personal choice to buy or sell and the selling price can go up or down pre and post.   it’s your money and your crystal ball.,2021-07-01T06:53:53Z

see p8/p9.  the level of qualification determines the criteria.  If Peak pursues qualifying under MV approach, there is a 90 day requirement to have stock over 4.

So JJ indicated they needed price above 4, what standard are they applying under?,2021-07-01T06:47:41Z

$PKKFF Good,bad,ugly.and the retarded which one is PEAK?,2021-06-30T19:41:30Z
$PKKFF   i’m not an expert on listing requirements.  however, i believe the company must maintain a $4 price for at least 90 days.  
could be wrong but that’s been my past experience.  not sure why the lawyer would indicate 3-4 weeks.

call was OK, not sure we learned anything other than the delay.  seems mackie is a source of the delay based on JJ comment.
 
woukd be good to have cubeler done by q4.

from my perspective q2 results and the forecast needed to drive sp.  

someone need,2021-06-30T18:47:04Z
