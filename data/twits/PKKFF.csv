$CCIV taking profits to $PKKFF,2021-06-10T02:45:11Z
$PKKFF  When you got the goods and are waiting for regulatory table knock, the best situation is to fly under the radar.   There isnt enough volatiliy for traders to get involved so its just sit in your rocking chair and wait or get up out of your rocking chair, sell your shares and buy GME like those without patience.   Very few will move here until news (or right before, depending if they are in the know).  

Painful lesson for shareholders and a leadership team that needs to be held accountable for a series of missteps, but the value proposition is enormous.   Frankly, Im not certain the leadership and advisory team is right for the potential.  

Anyways, patience will prevail.,2021-06-09T20:22:21Z

$PKKFF They‚Äôve crossed their T‚Äôs and dotted their I‚Äôs by the looks of the documents uploaded to SEDAR yesterday. 30-45 million dollar financing should inject enough capital to make up for any delay in its closure in terms of expansion. June 18 is 618 shopping day in China. More than 3X Cyber Monday in terms of money spent. Will be the first year with Peak‚Äôs financing program with JD.com in place! üí•,2021-06-08T16:41:47Z

$PKKFF  Been going a bit squirrely over the last year of lock down and  watching my stocks everyday.  Especially the shorts ,,  been gnawing away at my patience too.

  Ok  ,,,,  going to try not to look at my folio or chat rooms for an entire day on Monday, wish me luck  lol,2021-06-05T09:35:18Z
$PKKFF Picked up 2k more shares, have a great weekend see you guys next weeküòé,2021-06-04T19:44:52Z
$PKKFF   my take, the delay in the PP and financial restatements has set the company back a bit; esp for Nasdaq.  

I‚Äôll go a step further and state that IMO the nasdaq folks have told them the uplist needs a NA based revenue model, as well.  Just too much China hate these days.  Hence, the fast track for NA deployment.

Think the PP will close soon, deals will be announced and the company will pursue NA deployment ASAP.

Russel reconstitution is May/June and I don‚Äôt think Peak has any chance to make it.  That‚Äôs a big miss IMO.  

To me, company was over exhuberant and I put that on its advisors/BOD.  They have made some good hires along the way so need to give it time.  Q4 should see huge run in share price and next year could be parabolic.  

IMo, this is a buy/accumulate/hold stock.  Could run to double at any moment on a bit of news.  I‚Äôve got FV at year end with 65M US revenue pegged at MC abt 1B or abt 4x from here.

Good luck!,2021-06-04T17:46:55Z
