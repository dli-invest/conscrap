$PKKFF Can anyone point me to the float size. Thanks.,2021-06-04T00:03:50Z
$PKKFF Disgusting performance lately but it‚Äôll be worth it once we hear good old Jimmy Cramer talking about ‚ÄúTenet Fintech‚Äù  in 2022! üí∏,2021-06-03T23:58:53Z
$PKKFF ShopEX API allows up to 80 million micro shops to join the lending hub. Even if they get 1%, can you imagine the additional revenue that brings?,2021-06-03T23:57:26Z
$PKKFF Just a matter of time until the company vomits out all the news they‚Äôve been forced to withhold ü§Æ,2021-06-03T23:55:43Z
$PKKFF great day to go shopping,2021-06-03T19:16:56Z
$PKKFF what an absolute ridiculous past 5 months it‚Äôs been for this stock. Terrible.,2021-06-03T18:45:51Z
$PKKFF   $1.50 and lower is going to be brutal to witness but supports been broken,that‚Äôs where it‚Äôs heading ......,2021-06-03T18:26:01Z
$PKKFF  the folks in control like to hammer your confidence.  the most challenging time to hold is during a dark period.  in this case waiting for regulatory approval.

follow your conviction, timing the market is for the those that move the market.    those reddit/wsb stocks are analogous to a pyramid scheme, imo.   there is no compelling fundamental or growth story behind them.

as an ‚Äúinvestor‚Äù
you need to understand it‚Äôs ok to sacrifice short term opportunity cost for long term prosperity.  no one knows when news will break or when the manipulators will capture their intended shares snd the algos will reverse.,2021-06-03T15:41:12Z
$PKKFF They are making partnerships, want to making things right, and overall, buisness is working well even with the pandemic... Bullish of course.,2021-06-03T14:37:38Z
$PKKFF Remember all, when buying a stock, you are investing in a business. This business is so wonderful, so the lower the stock price, the more you can own of that business, the more exciting it is!,2021-06-03T14:36:57Z
$PKKFF I am very patient but seriously, the Titanic took longer to sink.  If things are looking great and the forecast is very favourable it sure isn‚Äôt reflecting that in the market.  I‚Äôm still bullish but I am also waning.,2021-06-03T13:48:55Z
$PKKFF  I wonder how many stop loss automatic sells got triggered today,seems the MM,s are testing everyday for cheap shares to resell later for a profit,2021-06-03T13:39:22Z
$PKKFF All is good here guys and gals. By the end of 2021, I do believe we&#39;ll look back on this delay in closing the offering as a blessing in disguise. Long term holders are holding strong, and mean time, JJ and team are still executing, generating revenue, raising capital, adding talent, rolling out in NA, and overall positioning Peak to be much more attractive than it was a few months ago for big investors. 

Going on Nasdaq a few months ago may have been a flop, without all the other pieces put together. Look at MNMD (mindmed) for example. There were not other catalysts at the time of uplist, it spiked for a day or two, and is back down to where it was before uplist. I really like Peak&#39;s trajectory right now, but have paaaaaaatience. Lots of patience.,2021-06-03T12:44:58Z
$PKKFF @hiddephijffer When moon?,2021-06-03T11:27:15Z
$PKKFF  um , I watched a Scotia algorithm short the fuck out of Peak today. Walls consisting of 20 ,  4k share blocks on buys and sells.  When there is low volume they activate. No, there wasn&#39;t any panic selling today , in fact there was low volume because no one was selling ,, but  ,,  also  no new buyers either. Need new volume.,2021-06-03T09:18:32Z
$PKKFF For those of you freaking out about the recent dip. A reminder we are up 700% over the last 12 months. Patience grasshoppers...,2021-06-02T21:17:14Z
$PKKFF  Patience needed. 
 The warrants and options are an overhang for this company.  Stock options are needed to attract talented leadership, OK.  However, A plan needs to be put in place to close out the warrants as the company moves forward.  The Q1  data was great, the presentation was poor, esp. the Finance piece.   Investors look to disruptive capability (check). market size (check), moat (check) and leadership (no check here, yet). As a company transitions from micro to nasdaq, you need a strong CEO and CFO, at minimum.   JJ is a young CEO, has done a good job leading and will just get better.  Jean, as CFO, looks to be seasoned vet, great for start-up but IMO lacks the skills necessary to be CFO for Nasdaq growth company.  Nothing personal, just didnt seem to be in the CFOs wheelhouse to do an investor presentation.  IMO, this is a huge gap and oppty as insty investor relationships are key.  

BTW, P&amp;L means little at this point,  ITS about revenue growth and cash flow.,2021-06-02T20:35:10Z
$PKKFF Why is it down 6.5% after the meeting?  Dilution:  There were 10 million warrants exercised in the first quarter  and the shares now total 128,086,286.  There are still still 19,460,869 warrants exercisable at .48 cents and stock options (payable to Officers, Directors and Employees, as well as others providing services) of 8,863,500 at 0.74 cents. The book value now is only 0.28 due to the loss of $936,611 and the increase in outstanding shares.  In addition, the loans overdue 90 days increased from 16.2% at Dec 31 to 18.4% at March 31.  That&#39;s all before they do any PP.  That&#39;s already potential dilutive contractual warrants and options.,2021-06-02T19:22:31Z
$PKKFF Stop loss Raids and Shorts been running Peak lately,I‚Äôll be patient n lock up my shares,2021-06-02T18:23:46Z
$PKKFF well this has been a disappointing day,2021-06-02T18:19:30Z
$PKKFF  won‚Äôt make money until Jane and the other shorting MM,s get lost,they‚Äôve killed the OTC,2021-06-02T18:07:24Z
$PKKFF I‚Äôve never made money on this stock. It only goes down when I buy.,2021-06-02T17:36:29Z
$PKKFF Apparently not a very inspiring conference call?  I guess I should listen myself.,2021-06-02T16:44:54Z
$PKKFF this fucking stock man.,2021-06-02T15:20:21Z
$PKKFF good time to load up. There will be this kind of volatility both ways until PP is closed, which should happen within next two weeks time. IMO,2021-06-02T15:11:15Z
$PKKFF I&#39;ll be honest kinda surprised by today&#39;s price movement even if I didnt like the way they displayed the financials,2021-06-02T14:58:58Z
$PKKFF another 1k shares in my pocket as well,2021-06-02T14:53:34Z
$PKKFF I picked up another 1000 this morning,2021-06-02T14:40:15Z
$PKKFF what did management mention on yesterday&#39;s call for today&#39;s reaction??? Any thoughts?,2021-06-02T14:00:00Z
$PKKFF note Q2 they will be profitable and prospectus could happen in June they think lots of clients will come on the lending platform through the ShopEx deal in the coming months and eternity
2-3yrs down the line the profit margins will be anywhere from 50-60%
They are just getting warmed up! just some of the best points moving forward although there were MANY! watch it yourself for more points,2021-06-02T13:07:26Z
