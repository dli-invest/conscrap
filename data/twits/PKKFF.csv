I can‚Äôt remember where I came across peak. I know I started keeping an eye on it almost 2 years ago (and started buying shortly after) does anyone here remember where they heard about this gem and care to share with the class?,2021-07-10T23:33:42Z
$PKKFF next week could be special.... 618 results and guidance coming.   Imagine if JJ comes out swinging with a 150mm+ revenue number .... He is not one to play it safe.,2021-07-10T22:39:12Z

$PKKFF I thought it strange they specified JD news would come in two or three days, why not just say next week. After a news release today I now expect news Monday and Tuesday. It would seem the dominoes are lined up.,2021-07-09T23:21:12Z
$PKKFF I‚Äôm a repeat buyer today at 1.59. Goldmine in the making right here.,2021-07-09T18:39:52Z

$PKKFF Wrote this on another board a few days back and figured I would share.  This is my option only and not a pump! Time will tell if my statement below is remotely accurate. GLTA üíéüß®

‚ÄúRead the UnionPay news release again last night.  This will be a game changer for Peak producing significant revenue in 2022-23.  I believe Rongbang alone could produce greater revenue than Peak produced in all of 2020.  Peak‚Äôs version of PayPal - Incredible!!! ‚Äú,2021-07-09T16:24:17Z
$PKKFF I just slapped the ask for 1250 shares. Up up up and away,,2021-07-09T16:17:34Z

$PKKFF added 6k more shares. Total holding 66k shares. I&#39;m so super duper bullish on the peak business. Will have alot of new releases coming up!,2021-07-09T14:47:11Z
$PKKFF $$$$$$$$$$ The turnaround begins. Slow and steady hands in management with a great plan. Love it now but will love it more as time marches on.,2021-07-09T13:53:31Z

$PKKFF @Stocktwits can y&#39;all fix the OTC charts?,2021-07-09T13:38:45Z
$PKKFF They are going to want to be conservative on guidance so they can blow it away imo. Will be interesting to see what it is.,2021-07-09T13:37:33Z
$PKKFF with all this cash on hand being accumulated... Some uh stock buy backs would be nice üòâ,2021-07-09T13:21:12Z
$PKKFF $300mm in june alone means up to 4.5mm in revenue from Unionpay since majority of funds were held in the hub.  Scaled up over the next few months and this could easily add another 40-50mm to revenue this year.  Come on JJ, give us that guidance ... I think I will go with $140mm+ for 2021..... hmmmmm,2021-07-09T13:08:48Z
$PKKFF The flood gates have opened for Peak PRs.  Union pay integration complete and 300M in transactions processesed during the month of June.... Only June... Wow...

$PKKFF will be my first really long hold, 5+ years. If it can keep its momentum, of course. Loading up next week!,2021-07-09T12:36:22Z

$PKKFF news likely next Tuesday on either 618 event results or guidance.   Both will be a barn burners, and I&#39;m not even taking into account news queued up for the past 3 months.... strap on your seat belts,,2021-07-09T02:04:49Z
$PKKFF JUNE PROGRESS REPORT
https://webfiles.thecse.com/PKK-CSE_Form_7_-_Monthly_Progress_Report_-_June_2021.pdf?Ix8qn257AJCluwU58DmRzJGKrU01WLW5,2021-07-09T00:06:43Z
$PKKFF with quiet period being over, we should see the first of many PRs that have been stacked up during that said period.,2021-07-08T18:56:14Z
$PKKFF  fyi, i have had every share I own (well into the six digits) out on loan thru Fidelity for months.  the interest rate is just under 5% (not a great rate, but that means that the borrowers are willing to pay at least 10% to short the stock).   this tells me the the stock is in demand for shorts, they are manipulating the share price down and it will recover when they get their shares.

the whole PP offering / delay played into their hands (and it wouldnt surprise if some of the delay was manufactured) and it cost the company time and money and shareholders dilution due to the lower share price.  

I expect PEAK to come guns ablazing in the next week or two.   That said, the  OTC is not for the feint of heart as manipulation and volatility is the norm for MMs/HFs to accumulate for themselves and/or their benefactors.   Uplist helps decrease the volatility somewhat and gets shares in the hands of true longs.  

If you believe, remain patient and expect a bumpy, hilly journey.,2021-07-08T18:46:19Z
$PKKFF up to 5000 shares. Now it&#39;s time to sit on those hands GLA..,2021-07-08T18:07:08Z
$PKKFF this is absolutely beautiful, I hope they hammer this way down so I can load up big time. Once they hit the PR button, this will moon.,2021-07-08T17:07:53Z
