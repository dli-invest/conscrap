$PKKFF  if UPST and AFRM are any indication of our future potential - we have a looong way to go on this undiscovered incognito pony. Youâ€™re absolutely insane to sell at these levels!  Accumulate with every dollar you have.,2021-08-29T19:00:34Z
$PKKFF Hoping Nasdaq info or date is mentioned during the earnings call tomorrow. Monday canâ€™t come soon enough.,2021-08-29T17:21:20Z

My 5 OTC ponies put on a composite 7% last week (4 up, 1 down) and all are still very much under the radar and have potential for massive gap ups with near term catalysts.

These are all long holds for me but whatever your trading style there is a lot to like with all of these:

$PKKFF You may not like their political regime or human rights agenda but you&#39;d be mad to ignore their increasing dominance in global commerce.

$PKKFF  So,  you will find a lot of posts on here from Longs that hold this stock. One thing about this particular room is that anything that isn&#39;t real news or a fact is instantly scrutinized whether it&#39;s positive or negative.  We don&#39;t want lies (which are illegal to spread) , we don&#39;t want someone posting crap and then have it reflect badly.

 Are people stoked on this stock?  YES.  Are people exited about this stock?  YES.  Am I bias because I hold a huge wack of Peak stocks myself?  YES.
 
 Always do your own research,  when you see something on a chat room and are interested , then back it up with your own DD. Chat rooms are not to be used for financial advice.

  Put on your &quot;DD caps&quot;  before you buy any stock.  You can certainly pop on a few chat boards to see what people are saying, but take it with a grain of salt and base your decisions on your own research please. 

 If you are new to investing I strongly suggest you READ as much as possible on how it all works.,2021-08-29T06:32:13Z

CSRC Spokesperson: The capital markets in China and the U.S. both have global significance and are increasingly interconnected. As growing numbers of companies, investors, and financial services providers are participating in each otherâ€™s markets, strengthening regulatory cooperation is the inevitable path. Weâ€™ve taken notice of the recent statement made by the SEC, especially the new disclosure requirements for registration filers. It is our belief that Chinese and U.S. regulators shall continue to enhance communication with the principle of mutual respect and cooperation, and properly address the issues related to the supervision of China-based companies listed in the U.S., so as to form stable policy expectations and create benign rules framework for the market.,2021-08-29T04:55:56Z
$PKKFF  Once you do a little research into China&#39;s economic reforms you realize that there is a lot of misinformation flying around out there. 

  Peak is an amazing opportunity as they are in there working with the Chinese government on the ground floor of these necessary changes. 

 JJ has been doing business in china for the last 10 years so he knows what&#39;s up. It was like the wild west with consumer and business loans being handed out like candy with interest rates at like 25%. What does this do?  It destroys the economy.,2021-08-29T04:55:34Z

Does anyone else remember that time JJ said someday the data would be more valuable than the loans? Yep. The futures so bright I need sunglasses!,2021-08-29T02:50:38Z

$PKKFF  Interesting, no crypto cash raises , guess they will have to use Peak to raise $$  , Unless it&#39;s the digital Wan of course.

I am expecting way more revenue than $104 million for 2021  after seeing this Q2 report. My reasoning is Q4 will have much more promotion and established adoption rates for all the verticals , and  there is also singles event in the last quarter. Q3 should be amazing also.  Its going to be the same old continuation of  Johnson Joseph over-delivering by a wide margin . I just don&#39;t see why analyst don&#39;t finally realize that projections will be a fast moving target for TNT , and i see no reason why this theme does not continue.  Actually i believe it actually accelerates due to the cash position , plus more verticals like advertising and the business data begins to really take effect in the future .  Logic sure does point to these conclusions . Looking forward to his revised financial predictions immediately after the cubeler closing.,2021-08-28T13:53:57Z

$PKKFF Still wowed by these Q2 earnings. They will easily beat their 2021 revenue guidance even without taking into account the NA expansion. This company is a champ. Raising my EOY price target to USD 20.,2021-08-28T08:48:20Z
$PKKFF  Great gain day with some healthy consolidation in the mix. Let those q2 numbers soak in over the weekend :),2021-08-28T05:29:53Z

$PKKFF Over a 20% increase in followers since I joined, which was only a few months ago. Drop a comment and let&#39;s introduce each other and yourselves. In two-three years I&#39;d enjoy a &quot;Peak Only&quot; family reunion, as our beloved company is about to become &quot;TNT&quot; and increase it&#39;s followers to at least 20,000.  That&#39;s a great thing of course but I&#39;d like to stay in touch with the early birds who share the same goal of wealth building though the powers of our Dear Leader JJ,2021-08-27T23:41:04Z
$PKKFF 1.9k shares filled out of 2k share @ $8.4. it&#39;s still cheap imo if we use valuate the company P/S of $104m CAD (84m USD) in 2021, it&#39;s around P/S 8 at the moment. Accumulating more share while i can. Let&#39;s enjoy the ride together.,2021-08-27T23:08:58Z
$PKKFF Fintech is really going crazy.  Check out AFRM in after hours trading after it was announced it would partner with Amazon for a buy now, pay later (BNPL) program.  One day people it will be our turn ðŸ˜‰,2021-08-27T20:57:08Z
