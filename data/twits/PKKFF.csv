$PKKFF For the last 3 months all we heard from the bashers, it‚Äôs a fake company, there is no news, this offering will never close, the ceo is a scammer taking your money, now that‚Äôs all put to rest. Now we will have to hear for the next 5 days offering is at $2. Ahh 5 more days and hopefully they will leave as there will be nothing else to say. See you in NA and Europe. Also when warrants get redeemed will be another $40 million for the company. Bye shorty,2021-06-11T00:31:34Z
$PKKFF Thats a raise worth waiting for...,2021-06-10T23:20:50Z
$PKKFF with the warrants that‚Äôs a $90m raise.... that‚Äôs not a micro cap raise lol. GLTA,2021-06-10T23:06:30Z

$PKKFF Offering discount to current SP is only 11%. Usually around 20%. Very good news. Warrants (non-tradable) at $3.5 also looks very good. Go time,2021-06-10T22:19:50Z

$PKKFF  OK.  My point on the leadership team is that it appears to me to be mostly administration guys in Canada.   The recent hire can help, but we are talking about executing a NA rollout.   We dont need guys sitting in offices.   We need an execution team with some seasoning.   Its apparent it exists in China.   IMO, that region is self-sustaining and has the right people, with connections in place.   Bravo.

I have no idea how they roll-out NA with the leadership team in NA.  Not only do you need to negotiate contracts, etc. you need someone to provide direction and follow-up.  It just doesnt happen. 
 I dont think its a plug-play without with some oversight.   Frankly, that&#39;s not a CEOs job.  You need to hire that infrastructure to oversee the roll-out, test, validate and take names, kick ass.    To me it needs an ambitious hiring ramp of doers.,2021-06-10T18:10:16Z

$PKKFF What is a realistic end of year price for this stock?,2021-06-10T11:52:04Z
$PKKFF  Oh where oh where did the uplist go?,2021-06-10T11:47:44Z
$PKKFF  Need to replace the CFO imo. Nothing personal but mistakes just cant happened in the future (one of which was not checking the PDF after converting to make sure it was successful and didn&#39;t chop off the end section LOL).

  Imagine if stuff like that occurred on the Nasdaq , great way to kill investor confidence.

  There are 1715 watchers on this board alone , maybe we should all email Peak today suggesting they &quot;replace the CFO to avoid any more loss of investor confidence&quot;

  I have no intention of selling any of my shares at all, I just don&#39;t like the CFO.,2021-06-10T11:46:35Z

$PKKFF  When you got the goods and are waiting for regulatory table knock, the best situation is to fly under the radar.   There isnt enough volatiliy for traders to get involved so its just sit in your rocking chair and wait or get up out of your rocking chair, sell your shares and buy GME like those without patience.   Very few will move here until news (or right before, depending if they are in the know).  

Painful lesson for shareholders and a leadership team that needs to be held accountable for a series of missteps, but the value proposition is enormous.   Frankly, Im not certain the leadership and advisory team is right for the potential.  

Anyways, patience will prevail.,2021-06-09T20:22:21Z
$PKKFF I‚Äôve never seen a stock with such little volume lol. Hard to believe this even exists,2021-06-09T15:36:25Z

$PKKFF They‚Äôve crossed their T‚Äôs and dotted their I‚Äôs by the looks of the documents uploaded to SEDAR yesterday. 30-45 million dollar financing should inject enough capital to make up for any delay in its closure in terms of expansion. June 18 is 618 shopping day in China. More than 3X Cyber Monday in terms of money spent. Will be the first year with Peak‚Äôs financing program with JD.com in place! üí•,2021-06-08T16:41:47Z
