$PKKFF   I would suggest selling something if you have to but own all the shares you want in this stock by Friday. I would suspect all this to start coming out next Monday.,2021-05-23T22:27:36Z

$PKKFF  I went back through the monthly reports and highlighted some of the more important topics being questioned on ST. Profitability, uplisting, stock split, etc. There are a number of huge announcements about to blow this wide open. Get ready for the dominoes to start falling!!  

PROFITABILITY:,2021-05-23T22:20:00Z
$PKKFF The more I look into this company the more money I want to put into it. This company is criminally undervalued with extremely strong financials and growth prospects. The only real concern I have is regulatory risk given that most of their business originated in China . I think I found a gem here,2021-05-23T16:45:50Z
$PKKFF So when is this company expecting to be profitable?,2021-05-22T21:58:41Z
$PKKFF Can anyone here confirm Peak is to release their Q1 by end of May? Thanks,2021-05-22T00:30:44Z
$PKKFF   This board is a perfect example of how under the radar this company is flying. When the offering is closed and all the reports come out this will start to get more notice. Then it’s going to make us some bank!,2021-05-21T22:11:42Z

$PKKFF $UPST on fire and up almost 250% year to date. A foreshadowing of things to come for Peak. And, why it’s wise to be early here before the fireworks begin/Nasdaq uplisting.,2021-05-20T15:22:59Z

$IDKFF I would pick $IDKFF over $VSQTF any day of the week. Copied from someone on the discord:

Insane YoY and quarterly growth for $IDKFF. NAV increased from 29.3m at 31 Dec to 57.3m at 31 March, a 95% gain. Pretty much flat during the months March and April, even though growth stocks were crushed. Currently trading at a 0.6 multiple to 30 April NAV per share (68% upside to reach NAV). Taking into account the current discount, the fact that some of its holdings were hit pretty hard in March and April (e.g. $SXOOF and $BTCWF), upcoming catalysts for certain holdings (e.g. $PKKFF) and some of the private holdings going public this year, I&#39;d say there is quite the disconnect between SP and value here...,2021-05-18T14:00:12Z
