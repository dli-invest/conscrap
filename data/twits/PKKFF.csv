$PKKFF  Good for Peak,  A rating and transparent with the Chinese government already and will remain compliant /  favorable.
  Invest in domestic company for your exposure to the Chinese economy and it&#39;s big companies.  Audits here.

 Any thoughts?

$PKKFF You keep hearing Peak is 2 years behind UPST.  If JJ and team can execute, this will be a very interesting story for TNT, easily pushing us into the high double digit range or possibly triple digits.   So what do they need to do to get there?????
- Grow QoQ and hit $500M in 2023 revenues
- Successfully expand operations global and within China
- Hire brilliant N.A. talent to complement the existing team
- Maintain low or no debt
- Control expenses while significantly improving supply chain margins
- Keep the outstanding shares relatively low (90M-120M (assumed 2:1 R/S) assuming future raises at much higher prices
- Acquire other businesses wisely
- Expand into new verticals 

Seems easy enough  ðŸ˜œ ðŸ’ŽðŸ§¨ðŸ’°,2021-07-17T14:35:02Z

$PKKFF great day today, tell someone about PKK this weekend and more importantly relax. Next week is gonna be interesting. Congrats longs, eat a bag of dicks shorts/bashers,2021-07-16T20:24:57Z
$PKKFF Great business model, competent management - they really just need to piece everything together and work on PR so their business is more understood. JJ doesnâ€™t sugarcoat and Iâ€™m impressed to see that they have been ticking off all the boxes necessary over the last few months. It sucks to watch a stock bleed, but Iâ€™d rather silence than empty promises. With 50 million in the bank, I see no reason that peak will be unable to uplist - and for insane growth to continue. Iâ€™ll just remind you all that this company has grown there revenue 40X in the past few years. From 1 million to 40 million. Thatâ€™s not a coincidence, thatâ€™s a good product. I like the stock!,2021-07-16T20:18:53Z

$PKKFF strong close especially for a Friday. Has the feel of a massive run like back in January. So undervalued, and under the radar.,2021-07-16T20:03:39Z
