interesting article, not sure what impact, if any, it may have on PEAK.  from my DD, seems we are well connected and aligned with the CCP.  that said, changes can happen quickly and with little warning. 

should be an interesting next 6 months,2021-06-25T02:09:00Z

$PKKFF The next week should be great and Iâ€™m excited whatâ€™s to come.  I will be taking a pause from posting here as there is just too much complaining going on for me.

$PKKFF Hopefully I am not the only one getting in at an average of $2.2 USD. Honestly I feel being fucked by the company management and the MMs. Long term very impressed with what the company achieved so far, especially the China team. But the company must learn from the mistakes and take actions accordingly.,2021-06-24T17:26:30Z

$PKKFF  For a small donation of as little as $5.00 per month,you can help less fortunate companies like poor little Peak get the resources they need to get their paperwork done so this will stop bleeding.With just one phone call you can make a difference.,2021-06-24T12:54:53Z
$PKKFF looks like I&#39;m gonna be adding more today then..,2021-06-24T10:05:36Z
$PKKFF Just doubled my position on this dip. This is a steal. Now it&#39;s time to lay back and enjoy the ride,2021-06-24T08:50:15Z
$PKKFF 5:1 r/s ??,2021-06-24T00:03:33Z
$PKKFF   to those who think
iâ€™m anti peak and anti peak leadership, itâ€™s not the case.  been part of a fortune 100 subsid start up.  what always impressed me was that our leadership and the parent leadership recognized when we more moving from vision to strategy to execution.  with that, the visionaries moved on and the executionaries moved in.  rather seamless and oh so effective.  

imo, thatâ€™s precisely where peak na is at.  the current team
did the heavy lifting to get the co. here and now itâ€™s time for the next wave to advance it further.  imo, every day it lags is a day lost to a competitor.  

evaluate emerging growth companies on revenue and cash.  proxy for me is 10-30 times annual revenue.  peak is big time undervalued and even more with the games.

e.g. 2021 rev = 100m
multiple = 20
mc = 2b
o/s shares pre split =150m
selling price = 13

bottom line, if the market values peak when on nasdaq they will be given high multiple -i bet 30 assuming revenue / growth model supports,2021-06-23T21:26:10Z
$PKKFF  well it seems those in charge of the selling price want an upsized reverse split to reduce the amount of shares outstanding.  imo, this could mean that retail will be limited in buying significant shares after the r/s because of the higher selling price.  if the stock is in demand, the mms as agents for tutes and HFs could rip it higher and limiting retail.

every shareholder needs to evaluate for themselves what they need to
do if they want more shares.  
although i am not accumulating more fidelity has told me that there are few shares available to loan.  bit surprised as the  interest rate hovers around 5%.  

imo, the business model is right time, right place esp. in china and emerging markets.  seems like plug/play to me but, you need to know china has influence.

my dd says the peak china team is top notch, top notch! need similar in na to execute unless itâ€™s license to a big player.

need to overcome the 1H issues and grow the team. time to get er done, Peak.,2021-06-23T21:09:49Z

$PKKFF People that topped up today on the dip, WELL DONE!  Hoping this PO is finally announced after hours! GLTA,2021-06-23T19:08:44Z
$PKKFF The volume in shares traded today hasnâ€™t been matched in 30 trade able days.and the days not over.Wish I had that kind of patience,2021-06-23T18:57:14Z

Good buying opportunities. Just loaded more on this dip.,2021-06-23T18:24:25Z

Well shit. Here we go, bring on the hate!,2021-06-23T17:02:57Z
$PKKFF  Next Support level is $1.50 USD if that breaks weâ€™re looking at $1.00.CFO shouldâ€™ve never given JJ the green light to optimistically discuss an uplist when the CFO is incapable of delivering on his end,yes they admit they need to hire more talent and at Least smart enough to realize the current management isnâ€™t experienced enough to satisfy the regulatory standards.Gonna need more then a 3/1 RS if the incompetent mishandling of pertinent information continues.Still Bullish and patient ,a lot of retail sellers will trade their shares to the patient,2021-06-23T16:45:14Z
$PKKFF how is this tanking today ? Unreal. Radio silence from company,2021-06-23T16:33:57Z
$PKKFF until something material actually happens the SP means nothing to me. Also I donâ€™t plan on selling for a few years anyway. This is just a nice area to continue to accumulate a little more each day. Donâ€™t know where the bottom is but Iâ€™ll get shares at all price points in this crater until it starts inevitably going up. Patience and steel hands will pay off. Looking forward to the meeting, guidance, and Q2 numbers,2021-06-23T16:28:01Z
$PKKFF if you can&#39;t stomach this going below $1 then sell your stock now and look for another type of investment. I&#39;m not saying it will dip below $1, but when you invest in microcaps like these you can&#39;t be all sad about a 50% drop or exuberant about a 50% increase. Those price movements happen all the time, and pretty often they happen back to back. All microcaps are story stocks, in that they have little to show for right now, but you trust management and the product. Don&#39;t invest what you can&#39;t afford to lose.,2021-06-23T15:27:59Z
$PKKFF Patience is a Virtue Meaning: The ability to wait for something without frustration is a useful skill and a good aspect of one&#39;s personality.
