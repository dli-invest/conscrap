$PKKFF    What is PKKFF&#39;s basic business model?

Is PKKFF mainly an internet/software based lending hub which connects borrowers to lenders and receives a fee or commission on funded loans?  If so, wouldn&#39;t a multi-media advertising campaign be the way to spur growth, (e.g. Capital One credit cards or Ditech Funding)? For the enormous size of the market they are addressing and the enormous size of their alleged partners, it seems like past revenue and projected future revenue growth is paltry. PKKFF must be doing something wrong.,2021-06-14T17:00:50Z
