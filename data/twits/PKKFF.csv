$PKKFF Figured I would copy what I just added on Discord!

Loved how JJ started the AGM presentation yesterday “As you all know, we have high expectations for 2021 &amp; a number of very exciting things we want to accomplish before the end of the year”. 

Other then getting straight to his Magnificent 7 topics… one big takeaway was JJ’s Cuberler vision:  He stated: Cuberler is essentially an ecosystem and we are building a global network of small businesses owners that can interact with each other and network among each other, literally linking SMEs from Canada, US, Europe, and China.  So Cuberler is like a dating app matching millions of potential businesses and collecting various service fees for providing critical business data along the way!

$PKKFF ———————————-
Q&amp;A section - 

- Will you hire a CTO.  Peak has a CTO in China, but by aquiring Cubeler, we are also gaining that knowlege along with the analytics team in Canada.
- Advertising component and networking.  Advertise products and services worldwide. Canada US China Europe. Global network of SMEs.  Financing is limited based on jurisdiction, but networking, advertising, downloading research reports, everything can be accessible to the entire network.
- Minimal impact on the operating results due to delay in financing. 
- Integration with Chinas digital currency. &quot;Yes...things have happened&quot;
- Progress with Digital Currency as well as payment processing functionality with Unionpay.
- Integration with Shopex - &quot;Very Pleased with the integration and revenues have hit Q2&quot;
 

**Overall timeline (As stated by JJ).  Closing of the prospectus at the end of next week.  Consolidation of shares a week or two after that, and then 3-4 weeks for nasdaq uplist.**,2021-07-01T12:22:28Z
$PKKFF   someone asked to buy now or after RS, that’s a personal choice to buy or sell and the selling price can go up or down pre and post.   it’s your money and your crystal ball.,2021-07-01T06:53:53Z

see p8/p9.  the level of qualification determines the criteria.  If Peak pursues qualifying under MV approach, there is a 90 day requirement to have stock over 4.

So JJ indicated they needed price above 4, what standard are they applying under?,2021-07-01T06:47:41Z

$PKKFF Good,bad,ugly.and the retarded which one is PEAK?,2021-06-30T19:41:30Z
$PKKFF   i’m not an expert on listing requirements.  however, i believe the company must maintain a $4 price for at least 90 days.  
could be wrong but that’s been my past experience.  not sure why the lawyer would indicate 3-4 weeks.

call was OK, not sure we learned anything other than the delay.  seems mackie is a source of the delay based on JJ comment.
 
woukd be good to have cubeler done by q4.

from my perspective q2 results and the forecast needed to drive sp.  

someone need,2021-06-30T18:47:04Z

$PKKFF dance floor has been cleared.  people have been anxiously waiting for a couple of months amidst lots of noise and distractions.  PEAK to take the stage shortly.  Can PEAK dance?,2021-06-30T11:56:29Z
@mrinvestorpro Hi! new folower here and novice at stockmarket. You do OTC stocks at all? If you do, I would really appreciate your take on $PKKFF before I throw some serious cash in there. I’ve done my dd, but I’m still learning the ropes so.. 
 
Anyway, thanks for all the tips and hard work you do to help others. Cheers!,2021-06-30T05:28:16Z
$PKKFF the longer this takes, the more I think its oversubscribed for $50mm from $15......let it marinate, it will be worth the wait.,2021-06-30T03:08:24Z
$PKKFF so word is the closing is July 7 now?  Which means no guidance until at-least then. It’s getting crazy now with all of these missed deadlines over and over. Investors losing patience here,2021-06-30T02:31:52Z
$PKKFF  waiting....... 🧐,2021-06-30T00:27:13Z
$PKKFF  Damn shame here,JJ could’ve been a great inspirational media mogul darling of color,how many African CEO,s are in the spotlight?Not enough.Instead PEAK wants to flounder as some inept,clumsy,buffoon that is quickly losing investor confidence,2021-06-29T22:17:53Z
$PKKFF 
Well shit. I guess I’ll buy some more. At least that way I can pretend like I’m happy about this.,2021-06-29T16:58:04Z
$PKKFF if you wondering why the SP went from 3 CAD to 2 CAD, the reason is simple, the so called longs sold there shares and bought in the private offering, a so called &quot;Gilbert...&quot; user posted himself on the StockFam discord group, he also posted that he received his shares (from the private offering) today, obvious he&#39;s posts has been deleted in minutes after... I have cached some of the reactions to he&#39;s posts,2021-06-29T15:46:25Z
$PKKFF 
Looks like another no news day here.,2021-06-29T14:58:03Z
$PKKFF does anyone has a link where I can see the real prices premarket?,2021-06-29T12:51:53Z
