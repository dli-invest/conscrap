Ok JJ close this PO and letâ€™s this thing fly! ðŸ§¨ðŸ§¨ðŸ§¨ðŸ§¨ðŸ§¨,2021-06-20T23:07:09Z
$PKKFF The warrants exercisable at $3.5, is this number prior to any potential reverse split ? Is it common for warrants to be issued materially above the stockâ€™s current share price ? That seems to be the case here,2021-06-20T21:53:07Z
$PKKFF JD announced that sales for this year&#39;s &quot;618&quot; event topped 269 billion yuan (nearly $38 billion USD), up more than 33% over last year.  

Very interesting times for Peak. ðŸ’ŽðŸ§¨

$PKKFF Why didnâ€™t they just hire someone with more PR/Uplist skills before trying to get on Nasdaq? Iâ€™m still long and not selling one share but they royally screwed up investor s  portfolios with this incompetence....,2021-06-18T13:29:44Z

$PKKFF for long term investors todayâ€™s price means nothing. I do think this will challenge 1.50 before the huge run. This is still a great place to start laddering. I have started a very small position and will add hard if it drops more.,2021-06-17T22:34:01Z
$PKKFF Who cares about the short term SP. Fundamentally nothing has changed. If you read the monthly reports everything is on track (except for the delay in PP which is proceeding as it should have just 2 months late). When there is silence like this the weak hands shake and post nervously about their concerns when in reality nothing has changed except you may have to wait an extra 2 months on the back end. If you are a long holder the numbers will eventually speak for themselves. For example, profitability in Q2. Revenue more than doubling in 2021. More deals signed. Margins improving. Expansion. There is one way up from here. Steel your resolve and be patient,2021-06-17T22:13:26Z
$PKKFF hey pickles, 195k is not high volume.  do you know how many shares are outstanding?   do you know what the daily traded shares are?  do you know they are in radio silent mode?   we dont need fud from manipulators, we need thoughtful, constructive comments.  notice even the pumpers are silent cause there just isnt much to talk about because of the delay.   good luck to you,2021-06-17T21:58:32Z
$PKKFF wow, not a good sign . SP goes down on a day with high volume. I wonder when the carnage will stop,2021-06-17T21:44:39Z

$PKKFF I see people comparing this company to Upstart as an example of what this company could become. Do you think that is a realistic expectation in the next year or two? Or a bit too ambitious?,2021-06-17T18:41:40Z
$PKKFF Itâ€™s been a long several months where we held well in a down market.  Take a breath and review all the past NRs and know the PO is finally closing after numerous regulator required updates.  

Now I got attracted to Peak for its potential before the major agreements signed over the past year, now my conviction has never been higher.  Am I bummed because of delays? Of course, but this is growing pains of a junior company about to enter the big leagues.  We are now days away from the closing of the capital raise, a week or so from the revised revenue forecasts, and just a few short weeks away from the Nasdaq uplist.  News releases have been held for 3 months so I expect multiple updates weekly following the PO closing.  This isnâ€™t new to anyone but itâ€™s important to stand firm on Peak or take this opportunity to buy if you can.  IMO, this is a very unique opportunity that will be many times higher 12-24 months from now with continued growth in China &amp; soon to be worldwide.  GLTAðŸ’Ž,2021-06-17T15:43:06Z
$PKKFF  who is selling me ALL these shares under $1.80?

$PKKFF Who is BossDak? How does he know emails hit the wires? And 50m on NASDAQ?,2021-06-17T11:51:06Z
$PKKFF One thing to keep in mind is that Nasdaq uplisting alone may not be a big catalyst. I&#39;m in SLHG (another Canadian small cap) which uplisted its otc listing to Nasdaq earlier this month, and the uplisting certainly has not been a catalyst. 

The difference with Peak is that the uplisting should come in tandem with news and most importantly, financial forecasts. So I think for Peak, the timing should work out well. Just as we have lots of news being released and excitement about future growth, we are on Nasdaq where big investors and institutions can buy. 

Still, good to keep expectations in check. We&#39;re not going to become millionaires over night, but a year from now a definite possibility for many of us.,2021-06-17T11:38:14Z
$PKKFF It seems the stock is dead in Frankfurt for days now. Been stockholder since two weeks but I think I was lucky to get some.... Dead meat right now ...... Unfortunately no other market available through my broker.,2021-06-17T10:49:32Z
$PKKFF  Well if it wasn&#39;t for the last couple months we all probably wouldn&#39;t have as many shares as we do now. Looking good :P,2021-06-17T09:07:54Z
$PKKFF does anyone know what is the average window of time for an offering of this size to close?  Does the company set a final date for everyone to send their Money in,2021-06-17T01:21:18Z
$PKKFF added 3k more shares @ $1.8. total holding 50k shares at the moment. too bad there&#39;s no option yet, else i would have buy call it for maximum gain.,2021-06-16T22:20:26Z
