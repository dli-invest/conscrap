$PKKFF ; The discussions between the Peak‚Äôs management and Cubeler progressed to the point where an announcement of the terms of the acquisition is expected before the end of August 2021. Those developments gave Peak management its first look at Cubeler‚Äôs revenue forecasts for the next three years, allowing the Peak‚Äôs management to begin the process of revising the Peak‚Äôs forecasts to account for Cubeler‚Äôs revenues, as well as to begin the planning Peak‚Äôs North American launch.
Peak‚Äôs management is preparing the filing of the Peak‚Äôs financial results for the second quarter of 2021, which Peak plans to file on August 27, 2021.,2021-08-08T16:25:22Z
$PKKFF This is my long term hold. I love leap options, and will get some when they are available. But my shares in Peak will not be sold, traded or loaned. There‚Äôs all kinds of ways to build wealth and I believe each stock or company determines which way you play it. 
Trust it don‚Äôt trade it‚ù£Ô∏è,2021-08-08T14:48:50Z

see below excerpt from mgmt update

‚ÄúTargeting the steel, petroleum, insurance and clean tech industries, the Issuer consulted with participants and specialists in those industries and looked at ways in which features, modules, platforms and functionalities could be added to the Business Hub to cater to the specific needs of participants.‚Äù,2021-08-08T13:38:36Z
$PKKFF if they short more, I buy more. Don‚Äôt fight the MMs, take advantage of how they play the game.  This will fly soon enough.,2021-08-07T21:56:11Z
$PKKFF @YoungAB  the stock is being held back by shares being shorted (approx 50% daily) by MM for wall street interests.  

i have approx 1/2 my shares or roughly 6 figure shares out on loan at just under 6%.  wish they were all
out as the mms play their games.  that‚Äôs just the way this works. 

it‚Äôs a cruel game.  also those warrants are hedges for short interest (or vice versa).  would be more beneficial if they were exercised so playing field was level. 

this could pop at anytime.  and one day it will.  that monthly corp
update yesterday was gold.  pure gold (or maybe bitcoin, pure  bitcoin).  if you can‚Äôt envision the future from
that pr you should not be invested here.  china is as green as it gets and that comment about clean tech is huge, just huge (just as much as petro).  

momentum
building and uplist will be surrounded by great news.  looking forward to q2 update as well.

hang on,2021-08-07T19:29:54Z
$PKKFF IMO the two biggest reasons this stock has been held back are being derisked as we speak. 1st is exposure to Chinese credit markets (even indirectly as it‚Äôs the market‚Äôs perception) and 2nd is 100% revenue contribution from China (similar but different risk in the eyes of some investors). As they build out the business hub and rebrand from current lending hub and expand into N.A. there‚Äôs no stopping this company.,2021-08-07T17:49:37Z
$PKKFF I&#39;m beyond bullish with this stock.  I&#39;ve been pounding the table for the past year to get all coworkers and friends in when it was in the 1s and 2s (pre RS)..... knowing what we know, the 6s is an absolute bargain when its 20+,2021-08-07T15:54:38Z

$PKKFF It‚Äôs clear the news releases will continue to improve with MZ Group controlling the PR flow strategically for maximum impact.  As you read the July progress report you see many more potential news releases coming and with NA, you will should start seeing major Canadian lending institutions coming onboard and hints to other verticals they will focus on‚Ä¶ this is why Ms. Dana Ades-Landy was hired in January 2021 to guide strategic development in Canada and utilize her existing connections with the National Bank, Scotia Bank, Laurentian Bank, and the Canadian Insurance industry. üí™üß®,2021-08-07T14:10:22Z

$PKKFF Peak just released their monthly report. WOW. If you thought things could not get any better. A lot of tidbits:

‚Ä¢ Distributor and retail financing programs now clearly biggest revenue and transaction contributors, eclipsing the supply chain transactions. This will improve the profit margins significantly
‚Ä¢ Development of platforms for the petroleum, insurance and clean tech industries in addition to the platform for the steel industry (announced this week)
‚Ä¢ In discussions with Petro China (FYI: Petro China is the biggest oil company in the world in terms of revenue)
‚Ä¢ Potential acquisition of a loan brokerage platform to provide asset and liability insurance
‚Ä¢ Talks of a marketing and client referral agreement between Peak and Union Pay
‚Ä¢ Terms of Cubeler acquisition expected before end of August
‚Ä¢ Forecasts will be revised upwards to account for NA expansion after Cubeler acquisition
‚Ä¢ Q2 results to be released on August 27

$PKKFF $IDKFF is heavily Invested in Peak,Sheldon Inwentash is no Saint but he knows his disruptive tech and junior resources companies like few others,the ‚Äúoracle‚Äù of OTC World is heavily invested in PKKFF and has vastly superior connections and resources to DD on this,good enough for me,my only complaint is a better looking website is in order,2021-08-06T22:02:47Z
$PKKFF Have a wonderful weekend everyone. üòÅ,2021-08-06T21:39:49Z
$PKKFF Close above 5‚Ä¶.. now it‚Äôs ready to move on Nasdaq‚Ä¶ and also in compliance already and above 5 will get attention of big buyers‚Ä¶ future looks very good here,2021-08-06T20:57:05Z
$PKKFF I&#39;ve done loads of DD on this stock, have loaded up some in the last few weeks when it was sub $2&#39;s before the reverse split. I agree with the bulls here that it is undervalued and the growth story is fantastic, but when I screen for undervalued stocks one of the most undervalued stocks on the whole market is $FINV, a similar company also in fintech, also from China. The thing is beat down and gets no love, the EV/EBITA is literally insane hovering around under 2 most of the time so I do just wonder will Peak get the love from wallstreet and retail that would drive this stock to fairly valued levels? Or will it be like poor old $FINV and spend months in no mans land cause of china FUD and investor hesitancy?,2021-08-06T20:31:45Z
$ORTX added another 3k. I am good. We feast when others fear. $BITF $HUT $PKKFF,2021-08-06T20:31:34Z
