$NSAV  Robinhood really F‚ÄùD up by having such a limited platform,offered limited exchange  and punched itself in the face with  bad publicity by spying/sabotaging its customers,really left the door open for a contender to step in and start disrupting $GRLF $MDCN $PKKFF $HLRTF,2021-07-20T18:11:44Z
$PKKFF I don&#39;t think this is a true &quot;sell the news&quot; event at this moment. First of all, we&#39;ve been in the green all day and are only red by a couple pennies. But also, there are some people taking profit after the run of the last few days, and there are also offering participants who are likely still overweight between the shares they acquired in the offering at $2 (CAD), and prior shares they were holding, and many of those 26m shares from the offering will likely be sold. In summary, I don&#39;t think anyone is selling the news, this is just the stock market doing what it does based on a whole lot of factors. If you are worried why we&#39;re not higher right now based on guidance, don&#39;t be. This is a story that is still unfolding and congrats on being in early.,2021-07-20T17:50:07Z

$PKKFF Wow - just woke up to this!!!!Congrats to all the Longs‚Ä¶ I had previously made some guesstimates  and am absolutely thrilled I was remotely close but projections like this are simply unbelievable - now with feet firmly on the ground we must execute and exceed these projections as JJ tends to underpromise &amp; over deliver! üß®üß®üíéüß®üö®üö®üö®üíéüíéüß®üß®üí∞üí∞,2021-07-20T13:15:17Z
$PKKFF Here&#39;s the revenue guidance from February 2020. Completely mind blowing how these numbers have changed in a little over a  year.,2021-07-20T13:08:24Z
$PKKFF Wow, amazing forecast. Totally crushed my expectations for 2022 and 2023. And I was hoping for 100m for 2021 but was prepared for 85. 

Consider that this forecast is subject to upward revision, as Peak launches in North America and then Europe. In my next post, I will share the last revenue guidance given in February 2020 for comparison&#39;s sake to show that JJ is always conservative on his numbers.,2021-07-20T13:07:18Z

$PKKFF oh man those numbers look juicy! That‚Äôs it I‚Äôm selling the farm.  Putting in this bad boy!,2021-07-20T12:47:22Z
$PKKFF Impressive numbers. I‚Äôm just curious as to how a company at such an early stage of growth could forecast numbers as far out as 2023. It seems like there are too many unknown variables to produce a reliable 3 year forecast,2021-07-20T12:44:49Z
$PKKFF  well, well.  if the projections are 80/20 and let‚Äôs just say hit them on the nail then this company deserves a 30 multiple (and could get much more) 

in us $ and assuming pre-consolidation at 150m shares i peg the mc and sp as follows (rounding fir display purposes)

21-75m rev, 2.2b mc, 14 ps

22-200m rev, 6b mc, 40 ps

23-500m rev, 15b mc, 100ps

just a tremendous growth story unfolding.

well done.   nasdaq uplist could be one for the ages,2021-07-20T12:40:01Z
