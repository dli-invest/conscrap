$PKKFF Fantastic news and great week again. I&#39;m on vacation and didn&#39;t worry at all about Peak since I knew JJ wouldn&#39;t let us down. Having a good time in London and I know Peak will eventually make it&#39;s mark here and abroad so hold long and strong, ladies and gentlemen. 

The only pain is while NA is sleeping, I&#39;m awake waiting for markets to open in the afternoon local time.,2021-08-27T05:23:54Z
$PKKFF - Peak to reach the milestone of having 100,000 businesses on the Business Hub by the end of the third quarter of 2021, which would represent less than 1% of the addressable market of over 115M SMEs in China.,2021-08-27T05:02:35Z

$PKKFF Awesome Q2 numbers, and some really great tidbits reading through the MD&amp;A of things to come, including having a customer pilot transactions from the Canadian business hub to the Chinese business hub later this year once they expand to Canada. They want to create a global network starting with Canada and China. One thing Iâ€™m a little confused by, they state their cash position or cash available for operating needs at , I believe it was 26M, as of august 26, 2021, but they just raised 48M? Are they saying this cash is for general operating and the other 20+M is set aside for expansion purposes ? Only other explanation is they spent a bunch on an acquisition or something they havenâ€™t disclosed yet, but canâ€™t imagine the cash would move out that quickly. Just a little confused by this and wondering if anyone else had any ideas.,2021-08-27T04:13:37Z

$PKKFF a couple quotes from the great Peter Lynch 
 
It takes remarkable patience to hold on to a stock in a company that excites you, but which everybody else seems to ignore. You begin to think everybody else is right and you are wrong. But where the fundamentals are promising, patience is often rewarded 
 
If you find a stock with little or no institutional ownership, youâ€™ve found a potential winner. Find a company that no analyst has ever visited, or that no analyst would admit to knowing about, and youâ€™ve got a double winner.

$PKKFF Donâ€™t underestimate this when the institutions and whales jump in.. Nio went from $1 to $67 in a year. This can make huge jumps tooâ€¦. UPST gained 57% on earnings beat and now worth $16B Market Cap. I stand firm with my target $30 USD,2021-08-27T03:27:14Z
$PKKFF Canâ€™t wait until Nasdaq uplist - literally anything is possible, which makes this super exciting. We all know weâ€™re going to fly to space - just a matter of which planet and which galaxy we go,2021-08-27T03:25:50Z
