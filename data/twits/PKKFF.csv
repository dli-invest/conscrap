$PKKFF hopefully we hold here cuz if not there is no support until the 1.50s. I‚Äôll load all the way down if it happens but no way I‚Äôm selling my position as this thing COULD rocket any time.,2021-05-27T00:13:39Z
$PKKFF   the clowns are out attempting FUD and here is an example, 

&quot;Perhaps there are some bad news some people are aware of and have been trading accordingly.&quot; 

Just a little, I mean a little due diligence would tell you that based on the 2020 YE Financial Statements there is about 150M shares outstanding (includes abt 30M warrants).    Peak is trading about 1M shares daily between US and Can.   That equates to about .7%.   

The stock up or down on this kind of daily volume is insignificant, meaningless and who cares?    

Longs will remain long, traders will trade (not volatile enough for traders right now) and manipulators will try to wear you down and steal your conviction and shares.

Everyone has a choice.   Some play for pennies and miss out on $.  IF you are in the game, dont let that be you.,2021-05-26T22:19:58Z

$PKKFF Any updates on the R/S and name change?,2021-05-26T17:47:36Z
$PKKFF   Bought the dip. Hit my goal. See what happens next couple weeks.  Closing, Financials, three year projections, uplist all coming soon. 
BUY BUY BUY!!!,2021-05-26T16:29:39Z
$PKKFF   Peak will have its day soon enough.  in the meantime manipulators will manipulate, pro/con posters will post, impatient will sell and patient will sit back.

Now, clearly there is a lesson and TBH it‚Äôs on JJ and the leadership team, for the most all young execs.  You don‚Äôt, just don‚Äôt, commit or forecast to milestones and timing unless you control the deliverable.  The forecasted PP and uplist timing is long since past.  That‚Äôs OK for now and everyday past is one day closer.

But, when you do get to Nasdaq, ‚Äúunder promise , over deliver‚Äù is the only way to succeed.  

This company will soon command a large, large revenue multiple.  Leadership needs to be thoughtful and conservative in any future communication.  I expect they will.,2021-05-26T15:17:14Z
$PKKFF in for 750,2021-05-26T15:06:07Z
$PKKFF Damn this thing is bleeding out and I&#39;m not seeing any news anywhere, thinking I should sell and buy back later, if they&#39;re going to do a share offering then that will drop the price even lower?,2021-05-26T15:05:02Z
