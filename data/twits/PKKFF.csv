314079170,$PKKFF And to everyone who is afraid of the reverse split: don&#39;t be! In this case its a positive catalyst. Assuming that the SP upon uplist won&#39;t be $5, they will be doing it so that big institutions (who can&#39;t invest in companies with a SP under $5) can get in upon uplist. It will also tighten the float of the stock. Once institutions will be fighting for shares on Nasdaq, this will rocket.,2021-04-10T09:50:56Z
314079079,$PKKFF Made an account just for Peak (soon to be renamed to Tenet, ticker $TNT). Holding since 2018. The company has so many short-term catalysts coming. A.o.: (a) approval of Nasdaq uplist, (b) 2021 and 2022 revenue guidance, (c) Q4 2020 numbers (expect a big beat), (d) more information on (signed) Pinduoduo deal, (e) expansion to North America. Wouldn&#39;t surprise me if the SP is at $40 mid summer. They should do like $200m revenues this year and $500m revenues next year, not taking into account any new deals and the expansion to North America, and will likely be profitable this year. Simply compare the multiples given to similar fintech companies in the US, Affirm and Upstart (30-40x 2021 revenues), to Peak (1x 2021 revenues) and it is evident that Peak is MASSIVELY undervalued. Looking forward to the ride this year. Hopefully conservative 2021 revenue guidance that will be beat each quarter resulting in massive upswings of the SP. What an opportunity to get in at ground level.,2021-04-10T09:48:23Z

313456971,$PKKFF Made an inquiry to Mark at the MZ Group regarding the status of the public offering. 

He replied within minutes saying:  â€œIn terms of the offering, I can&#39;t speak in specific terms about the delay.  I know the company has a history of being on time with their announced deadlines.  In general for offerings there are always legal and regulatory items that need to addressed, those often are out of the hands of the company in terms of time frame.   We do expect it to close and certainly understand the concern about why it has not. â€œ,2021-04-08T18:54:12Z
