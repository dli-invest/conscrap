$PKKFF is it too late to buy this? ;(,2021-08-13T03:32:59Z
$CELZ For those looking for an example of a reverse split on the OTC that is a precursor to an uplisting I&#39;ll refer you to Peak Fintech, $PKKFF that had an RS in the past few weeks post close of a funding round. 

They went through an RS and a cap raise to gain compliance for uplisting and are now trading at all time highs (even accounting for the RS).

An RS with a plan is good.,2021-08-13T03:14:20Z
$PKKFF  I think this is the safest way to play the China economy without getting burned by the Chinese stocks.,2021-08-13T02:47:40Z

$PKKFF Someone mentioned buying this  MVST  today.

Had a look, and noted it just Uplisted to Nasdaq Jul 26.
(Middle gap in chart)

The chart didn&#39;t budge from its trajectory.  Interesting.,2021-08-12T22:52:18Z

Great vid summarizing Peak Fintech,2021-08-12T22:12:38Z
$PKKFF crazy low float means that this thing can start running to 20x+ multiple of sales .... it may shatter our expected targets.,2021-08-12T21:54:05Z
$PKKFF  this is not a stock that you day trade or flip after a week.... Those that are will have major fomo and regret when they see the ticker a month from today. 

JUST buy, hold, get rich.  Keep it simple and dont try to time it... hold and win.,2021-08-12T21:39:36Z
$PKKFF loving this run but my technical indicators are through the roof. Rsi 89.9 on daily but could be messed up cuz of the R\S. I want to buy more but will enjoy the profit for now.,2021-08-12T21:31:51Z

$PKKFF Has anyone seen or heard when we&#39;ll see Q2 2021&#39;s results?,2021-08-12T21:07:41Z
$PKKFF holy crap. Loving the daily gains.,2021-08-12T21:06:36Z
$PKKFF Any other stocks you are guys are looking at thats in the beginning stages?,2021-08-12T20:57:25Z
$PKKFF If you think this is the height, think again. in pre RS pricing, we are at $3.76, not a HUGE gain compared to what this  company is really worth. The RS helped push this higher as well, because of the lower float. This is going to $25-30 by EOY easily if PR&#39;s are released consistently with good catalysts, which I believe we will see. I am also heavily in $MNMD, it fell asleep after NASDAQ because there is nothing moving it until trial results are in + some insider exits. Here it&#39;s a different story, we just need to reach milestones and deliver and we go to the sky once we reach NASDAQ.,2021-08-12T20:47:51Z
$PKKFF to those silence new posters that said they sold PKKFF and move to other stock _|_ ..  if you want to prove a point please have some courtesy to show some proof and don&#39;t bullshit.,2021-08-12T20:44:17Z
$PKKFF I guess yesterday was a good time for a starterðŸ˜…â€¦ thought for sure this would drop 20-30% today. Iv got 3500, would like to increase too 10,000. Iâ€™m sure these are small numbers compared to you guys that got in years ago.,2021-08-12T20:37:36Z
$PKKFF duediligence dude must have missed my previous messages.  You donâ€™t create wealth by selling a stock for 30-40-50% gains. You create wealth through long term investing  
When you find a wealth creator stock like peak they will say you are wrong. When you hold one they will say you are stupid. When you get rich they will say you got lucky. Gotta love being wrong, stupid, and lucky 
49,000 shares at 2.20 average (pre split) and havenâ€™t sold a share. so I also practice what I preach,2021-08-12T20:25:49Z
$PKKFF In interest of full disclosure, Iâ€™m now out of peak. I love what the company is doing and remain extremely bullish, but I had to move some profits over to $MVST on todayâ€™s dip. Good luck to you all! I am already regretting having to sell peak but microvast is my baby so Iâ€™m fine with my decision. Congrats to all the long term bulls here!!!! Hopefully Iâ€™ll be back one day!,2021-08-12T20:14:21Z
