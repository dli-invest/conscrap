$PKKFF Go to LinkedIn n read experience of the controller. If that inspires confidence, please give me some of the kool aid cuz I’m not convinced . And read the CFO background on the PEAK site n nothing specific about his experience … what prior companies n specific positions. Yes I agree they have grown revenue as did costs. Earnings n cash flow to grow the business remain elusive. All I’m saying is that the people in key positions for Nasdaq n continued growth n expansion is going to require more pedigree. IMO. I’m still optimistic but less so by the day.,2021-06-22T23:01:05Z
$PKKFF Since everyone else posting their opinion on Management and seems to be a hot topic fueled by frustration over the offering closing and no share price movement as of late, no board is going to get rid of a management team that grew the company from 1.8M revenue to 42M in 3 years and potentially could reach close to 100M this year. Over what, an offering taking 2 months longer than expected and running into unforeseen regulatory hurdles? Wow, get rid of them!! The reality is they implemented a strategy and its working, why would they need to be replaced? A typo in the FS? The reality is none of you criticizing them have any idea what’s going on behind the door , you’re mostly just frustrated with this dark period. With all that being said, I’m not arguing that they shouldn’t bring on needed talent to complement growth, entering the “big leagues” etc (which we’ve seen recently with marketing hire and controller hire). JJ stated already part of this capital raise is for that.,2021-06-22T21:11:25Z
$PKKFF I couldn’t have said it any better than J Rockford. He is absolutely correct. I’m having serious doubts with regard to this present management team’s ability to expand this company to the next level. The potential of PEAK is incredible but the management is mediocre at best. They just don’t have the talent to create the next Upstart, unfortunately.,2021-06-22T20:55:14Z
$PKKFF Peak’s slide decks (English &amp; French) just got posted on SEDAR.,2021-06-22T19:23:15Z
$PKKFF Lets give Peak a few months to recruit hard and attract top talent.  @jrockford is correct, it’s not going to be cheap but its needed and well worth it to meet the market challenges ahead and also to deliver a winning Nasdaq formula.  I’m confident these steps are already underway - time will reveal whether I’m right or not! 💎🧨💰,2021-06-22T18:30:54Z
RE-ISSUED: Peak First Quarter 2021 Results Show Revenue of $14.2M, Setting the Stage for Potential Milestone Year https://conferencecalltranscripts.com/summary/?id=239350&amp;pr=true $PKKFF,2021-06-22T18:26:11Z
$PKKFF  for all the rookies out there that think Peak will just uplist and rick and roll… look at the leadership teams at Stripe, Upstart, Square and Paypal.  Look at their backgrounds and imagine that to attract this type talent you named to pay up.  Most important look at their CFOs.  They are young phenoms.  I know one of them.  Phenomenally talented, great background.  

To play big in this space you need talent.  And young talent that is mobile, assertive, and looking to make a difference.  It’s not at PEAK now, no matter what you think.  They may be great people, but you need superstars looking to be be differences makers.  

Inwentash as an offers no value in the Fintech space, the CFO offers no capital markets value and has no experience in running a nasdaq company.

Point is, if Peak wants to play with the big boys, you need to surround yourself with motivated, incentivized talent.

Make something happen.  leadership strategizescand thinks ahead.,2021-06-22T18:20:46Z
$PKKFF added another 500 today..,2021-06-22T17:03:17Z
$PKKFF  I must say, while I am very bullish on fintech and Peak’s  position in China, the lack of accomplishment on arguably the two most significant NA administrative items (PP and Nasdaq) along with numerous administrative errors and missed milestones is troublesome.  It’s not to say they won’t get done but a great idea with incompetent leadership is like great leadership with an incompetent idea.

Will remain patient fir the upcoming PRs but IMO significant organization changes are needed to exploit this tremendous opportunity.  IMO, the current NA team does not have the “it” factor.  

A great BOD recognizes when things need to change, let’s see.,2021-06-22T15:12:33Z

$PKKFF The warrants exercisable at $3.5, is this number prior to any potential reverse split ? Is it common for warrants to be issued materially above the stock’s current share price ? That seems to be the case here,2021-06-20T21:53:07Z
$PKKFF JD announced that sales for this year&#39;s &quot;618&quot; event topped 269 billion yuan (nearly $38 billion USD), up more than 33% over last year.  

Very interesting times for Peak. 💎🧨
