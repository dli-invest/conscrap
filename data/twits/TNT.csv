$TNT Dear SEC.  Tenet Fintech has put numerous scary as F* disclosures regarding the high likelihood the china will screw investors over.  And as a result all potential investors will be scared away after reading the registration statement.  Now can you just approve the god damn 40F already!  

Thank you!,2022-01-21T00:00:17Z
$TNT might not be ideal to get back onto Nas at this moment tbh..Shocking markets.,2022-01-20T22:06:52Z
$TNT Investor Relations is useless.  I spoke to Cathy yesterday and asked what action was taken since the Dec 30 40F update from the SEC.  She said Tenet responded to SEC last week.  I asked if it was a letter or an amendment.  Cathy said it was a letter &quot;I believe&quot;.  I said &quot;why don&#39;t you know for sure?&#39;  She said that if it was an amendment it would show on SEC website.  Well Tenet filed an amendment yesterday!  How does she not know this.  Useless.  Good news is that amendment is filed.  Now we wait again.

$TNT who is biting the bullet and selling for a loss?,2022-01-20T19:42:26Z
$TNT corrections weed out the soft, but money is made in buying corrections and crashes and not made chasing. These prices are a gift. Re-listing and putting the short and distort in the rearview will see price discovery this year. 

Somebody said something like short attacks always wreck co&#39;s---- not so--- they went after TNDM and AMD and got those down to pennies look where those are priced now. 

Dont buy into BS guys--- the fintech industry is exploding or it&#39;s not and this co is making crazy money or it&#39;s not. That&#39;s it.,2022-01-20T19:35:21Z

$TNT Hi,

So I was informed by the team in China that the partnership is still on. We need to obtain a licence to begin the transactions and we‚Äôre aiming for March to have this licence in place to begin the transactional portion of this partnership.
