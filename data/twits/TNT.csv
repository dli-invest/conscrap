$TNT I don&#39;t see why this can&#39;t be done in a day or two tbh. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if we&#39;re still on track to resume trading by Oct 4. Any reason why this would take more than a couple of days? Im assuming this means the form has been reviewed in it&#39;s entirety and the only open item is the additional disclosure needed to satisfy the new SEC guidance,2021-09-29T05:19:06Z
$TNT  well the nasdaq news from Peak came quicker than i expected.  imo, clearly this company does not have the leadership firepower to properly vet corp governance items.  PP and 40F are shining examples.  

imo, while it has no impact on the business or itâ€™s value proposition this reflects poorly on the company leadership.

who knows if/when the company will comply.  iâ€™m not certain abt timing to relist on otc.   that said remaining on otc is OK, but doesnâ€™t give the company access to the greater capital markets and credibility it needs.  sadly, these events are incredible IMO.  

iâ€™ve said for a while the china only channel is or could be an issue.   this should encourage fast track of cubeler and NA.

ball is clearly with Peak to provide shareholders a clear snd meaningful update.

say whatever, this is not a good course of events.  no other way to spin it.,2021-09-29T04:58:23Z
$TNT Wow where to begin with the news we just got.  Whatâ€™s the consensus here? Seems annoying that Peak still has hoops to jump through but good that the company has clarity with what they want and we know can see and end to this distraction. Meanwhile we continue trading in Canada and moving forward. Just my take at first glance.,2021-09-29T04:36:56Z

$TNT  I&#39;m fine with waiting for the SEC to do it&#39;s thing and to get up and trading again on the Nasdaq as I am long and don&#39;t really care,,  eyes on down the road like 2023 and beyond anyways.  

  That said  ,,,,  it&#39;s fukin annoying to be sure.

   Rather have just waited longer to uplist till all the entities were totally done their reviewing.

  If it&#39;s going to take a while then get it up on the OTC for now so US people can trade domestically.  If it&#39;s a matter of a few more days may as well wait it out I guess....,2021-09-29T04:11:40Z

$TNT  another interesting twist with Nasdaq dropping their certification.  lots of speculation and rumor.  iâ€™m not familiar with the nuances of SEC/Nasdaq communication and procedural compliance of certification, effectiveness approval, etc.  

so stock is halted?  or is it based on the nasdaq communication?  maybe itâ€™s in a grey area?  who knows.  

during a halt you can or canâ€™t have prs?  letâ€™s say your in this grey area snd you just closed an M&amp;A transaction?  if memory serves you have 4 days to disclose and file an 8k.  

is it possible that nasdaq rescinding certification opens the door for news to be released?  

sec certification can take a few months.  crazy, right.  does peak have a few months to hold off on cubeler, announcing new partnerships or any transaction that is considered a material event?

nothing has changed with the company.  bureaucracy can stifle the greatest idea.  

hard to say who jumped the gun.  think all parties are responsible.  letâ€™s see whatâ€™s next,2021-09-28T23:24:59Z

$TNT a twitter account proclaiming to find 3x returns and a 300% average return per year, has went nuts for Peak. theyre based out of Toronto, apparently, and are called &quot;multibagger capital management inc&quot;,2021-09-28T22:09:37Z
$TNT someone please explain . So is it still in review at SEC or is it approved for trading . Thanks,2021-09-28T21:46:46Z
$TNT SeanK off the discord says it well:

Nothing new, Nasdaq canâ€™t leave its approval letter on the desk with SEC going through form 40-F. Itâ€™s pretty meaningless at this stage since everything has to go through SEC and be confirmed by them. Once SEC is done with the review then Nasdaq confirmation and trading will follow.,2021-09-28T21:41:02Z
