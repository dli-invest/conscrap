$TNT There is a limit to the amount of cool-aid one should drink before you getting in too deep. I am a long, don&#39;t short and don&#39;t rely on stop losses. But JJ and his team are rookies at best when it comes to the all important SEC filings. Smart experienced leaders know and anticipate roadblocks in advance and plan and execute on them before they become this big of a problem. I am not impressed with these chumps especially when I look at the financial bath I have taken after listening to the hype here. I&#39;ll pass on the T shirt, just get your act together JJ. I am really tired of the antics. I hope all the revenues you are posting stand up to the audit you might be facing cause right now your cred is Zero.,2021-12-31T04:51:17Z
$TNT so the SEC basically said, we don‚Äôt have any direct questions or comments but read over this new registration guidance that was released a week ago, do our job for us, and make sure we didn‚Äôt miss anything, SEC is even more pathetic than I thought! Didn‚Äôt think it was possible.. good news is, how about those 12/12 numbers? Way bigger than I expected, 40-50milion Q4 revenues pretty much guaranteed üçª TNT will hit new ATH‚Äôs this year only a matter of time,2021-12-31T04:47:34Z
$TNT I&#39;m going to email Barry and tell him that the t shirts need to be revised. I want mine to say &quot;I held through the great SEC FUD&quot; üí™ lol,2021-12-31T02:19:07Z

$TNT I&#39;m kind of wishing Tenet will be a smart ass and amend the risk disclosure to add in really big bold letters at the top:

&quot;THE SEC WANTS YOU ALL TO KNOW THAT THEY BELIEVE THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY IS GOING TO DESTROY THIS COMPANY, AND THEREFORE YOUR RETIREMENT&quot;,2021-12-31T01:23:39Z
$TNT Nice Little Hint there:

‚ÄúThe good news is that it appears we will make our forecast‚Ä¶ ‚Äú,2021-12-31T00:52:01Z

$TNT More selling coming tomorrow. It‚Äôs okay, blast me all you want. You e been doing that since I sold at $14, $10, and $8. There will be a right entry, but it‚Äôs not yet now. There are other plays I‚Äôve taken advantage of while Pkk remains in a drop zone. It‚Äôs been good. Im watching Tenet and will jump in high $5s unless things change. Having money sit there doing nothing doesn‚Äôt make sense yet. Only intelligent comments I‚Äôll read, otherwise block me if you‚Äôll feel better. Hater will be haters. The best transactions allocate equal discussions to the both up and down realities of stock trading.,2021-12-31T00:21:00Z
$TNT today news is a statement on how valuable TNT platform to sme,2021-12-31T00:08:14Z
$TNT Unexpected news release today but overall thrilled with the 12/12 revenue which all but guarantees we hit or exceed our revised upward FY guidance of $109M - ‚Äúit generated approximately CAD$9.9M in revenue by working with multiple e-commerce platforms and several NEW RETAIL AND WHOLESALE CLIENTS.‚Äù  LOVE ‚ù§Ô∏è IT! 

Regarding the SEC, seems like Tenet is one of the first companies with the majority operations in China to endure the new SEC rule changes‚Ä¶ so once again we respond to the latest SEC updates  from December 20, 2021.  Tenet will get their uplisting but this constant moving target by the SEC is getting old!! GLTA,2021-12-30T22:57:07Z
$TNT I&#39;ll tell you what tho when we blast off next year I&#39;ll be gloating towards the panic sellers and haters. I actually like money unlike them.,2021-12-30T22:39:56Z

$TNT SEC is getting more and more bullshit. Took so long just to give a simple comment, i hope they are not playing delay game by giving the next comment on what Tenet&#39;s staff have for lunch in daily basis.,2021-12-30T22:10:33Z
$TNT Just bullish!

$TNT that $5.60 and $4.90 seem to be strong support levels.  Bought today at $5.39 and $5.20. Had an order at $5 but I‚Äôll be honest it felt like the avalanche was coming there and canceled It. Happy though it bounced very strong off that $5 level,2021-12-30T21:19:57Z
$TNT Sad sell reaction from people. Sucks about SEC just delaying shit, hopefully some news about turnaround can be said one of these days. However, amazing news about revenue which is what really should be feeding the SP.,2021-12-30T21:01:57Z
$TNT Is nothing on discord?,2021-12-30T20:51:04Z
$TNT for all of you that think this is all about Nasdaq, give UPST a look and see what they did over the last three months. The company is making money here hand over fist and continues to execute at the highest level with explosive growth. The SEC will do it‚Äôs thing. It‚Äôs all about mid level bureaucrats making it look like they put Tenet thru the ringer before the Nasdaq uplist. As another poster indicated, they are all out of ammo. The results out today were more than fantastic.,2021-12-30T20:50:31Z
$TNT curious to know  what TNT is predicting for quarterly revenue next year.. are we going to see our first $100 million quarter in q4?,2021-12-30T20:44:13Z
$TNT Looks like more stop losses,bagholders,and scared money settled for a tax loss instead of just holding tight a bit longer,oh well guess that&#39;s just the way it goes,2021-12-30T20:36:04Z

$TNT let‚Äôs see if we can finish green today and at $7 or higher on the CSE. Doing so likely signals a reversal imo.,2021-12-30T19:57:51Z
$TNT Maybe the company needs to focus its attention on TSX listing and just let Nasdaq happen when it happens. TSX would give them the needed exposure to institutional investors and help ensure sp stays above Nasdaq requirements.,2021-12-30T19:24:06Z
$TNT might not meet nasdaq requirements by the time it‚Äôs finalized!,2021-12-30T19:12:25Z
$TNT this company is making a ridiculous amount of $$$, and it‚Äôs only accelerating.,2021-12-30T18:52:22Z
$TNT from Doorknob on Discord: 

Talking with Cathy who was recently in direct communication with JJ .  Basically the SEC has ran out of questions about our submitted form.  SEC may want us to  change a few phrases to make it look like they are really doing a thorough review of this process. Call it window dressing if you will for the SEC. Meanwhile the company is trying to get on the TSX BY end of Q1  which would give them world exposure for institutional support and 2 months after that they could be on the Hong Kong exchange. They know they will be on the NASDAQ and J J  STRESSES that he feels now the end game is in sight with the NASDAQ  as frustrating as this process has become.,2021-12-30T18:46:21Z
$TNT as disappointed i am with the nasdaq delay fiasco, i&#39;m as confident about the direction of the company as i&#39;ve ever been.   I guess 2022 will be the year of nasdaq, canadian launch,  US launch, tsx, hong kong exchange, south america launch,  record revenue, and net income that will blow your socks off.   Those 3 rocket emojis were not put on their christmas tweet by accident.......

I&#39;m assuming we&#39;ll get a SAKDOS breakdown of the letter later tonight ?.,2021-12-30T18:44:51Z
