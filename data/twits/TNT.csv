$PNDHF $TNT $LGIQ  Canadian Listed Companies are my biggest positions!! They are trading at massive discounts compared to nasdaq traded companies.  Only one way to go and that is Up!!,2021-10-01T01:50:41Z

$TNT Ha, stick suspended thanks to JJ&#39;s crapy execution and management of the company.  Or is it because of the Chinese connection? I hope the SEC sorts out this buffoonery.  

And if TNT is found guilty of securities fraud, I hope it gets delisted for good.  The Chinese have enough American blood and treasure.,2021-10-01T00:30:49Z
$TNT @ProspernCapital Thats exactly right. For those who saw the indexes in the US nosedive in the last 15mins will know that we held up well and stayed positive. Reflects the fact that some investors are slowly coming back to the name. Pkk/TNT calm and long!,2021-09-30T23:16:18Z
$TNT in a blood overall market, the Canadian side (PKK) held up well finishing in the green. Shareholders, for the most part know what they own here. The closing of the Cubeler acquisition is a gateway to North America and is HUGE for this company!,2021-09-30T23:07:03Z
$TNT 

I predict one month until relisted on NASDAQ.,2021-09-30T22:45:19Z
$TNT It‚Äôs a little draining emotionally when there‚Äôs either no news, no stock price, different pieces of information from so many people.. even though as far as I can tell they‚Äôre all true. Speculation and waiting. 
But guess what ..next week is going to be awesome‚ù£Ô∏èüíéüß®,2021-09-30T22:36:00Z
$TNT PKKFF traded 39k shares on the OTC today.  Last trade 7.78 US.  I think just the news of the 40-F re-submission will spark a rally.  I was wrong, I thought this would take a few weeks.  Looks like we might be 1-2 weeks away from trading back on the big NASDAQ.,2021-09-30T21:39:25Z
$TNT In the US its not trading it just the brokers that use the canadian shares and convert to US. Which is good news it means that management realy will make this fast back to nasdaq,2021-09-30T21:02:03Z
$TNT not a bullish chart - falling knife trash,2021-09-30T20:36:13Z
$TNT bids piling up, nobody selling.,2021-09-30T19:43:05Z
$TNT For those wondering how you‚Äôre able to buy PKK in the US‚Ä¶seems some brokerages are using the PKKFF symbol but you are buying shares on CSE in Canada after exchange from CAD to USD.
It was communicated that there would be no switch back to OTC as the next step is re-list on Nasdaq.,2021-09-30T19:23:11Z
$TNT just a heads up. I have Schwab and I was just able to buy 1 share of pkkff and sell 1 share of  pkkff on the OTC,2021-09-30T19:16:48Z

$TNT seeing the sp 7.53 on fidelity right now.  The ticker is back to pkkff.  Can anyone explain?,2021-09-30T18:15:59Z
$TNT   Kathy just called to tell me we were trading at Schwab on the OTC.  Had to tell her Stocktwits beat her to it and I already bought more shares. She did say ‚Äúthe Cuberler press release should go out today or tomorrow and right now there is a sentence included that gives the date of release on forward guidance. If Johnson doesn‚Äôt remove it.‚Äù Good to hear.,2021-09-30T18:14:10Z
$TNT tomorrow new PR,2021-09-30T17:58:12Z
$TNT I talked with Cathy Hume 9am CST this morning, she informed me that JJ is going to resubmit the revised form 40-F either tomorrow or Monday but that #Peak is working closely with the SEC to make sure every box is checked of which SEC expects.  They wish for a Fast/Smooth process with the SEC in hopes to be back on #Nasdaq quickly!

The #Cubeler #Acquisition News will be disclosed within the next couple of days.  She also mentioned they wish to be back on #Nasdaq before disclosing ‚ÄúRevised Upward Forward Guidance!‚Äù,2021-09-30T17:53:15Z

Hi , people are reporting OTC trading on Peak on TD and I think a couple other, we are wondering if a potential time frame for Nasdaq relist has change

to me

Yes this is true. Still no timeframe on Nasdaq relist but great to see the liquidity for US shareholders.

Cathy,2021-09-30T17:29:08Z
$TNT Lovely rally on Canadian side . We will be back on NASDAQ next week per Cathy. I predict we will be above 11 CAD after Cuebler announcement tomorrow and will reach new ATHs in October. $25-$30USD by EOY.,2021-09-30T17:20:39Z
$TNT   I spoke with Kathy yesterday.  I got the same as some of the others I saw posted so I didn‚Äôt post. If you want a repeat from someone else here it is. 
* Announcing Cuberler Friday.  
* Waiting to hear from JJ about announcement on forward guidance. 
* Having conversation with SEC today    regarding 40F. 
* Guidance from SEC has been all about Chinese issuers and we are Canadian. 
* Conversations have all been friendly, not hostile. 
* Resolved in days not weeks. If it gets prolonged they have the option to trade on OTC but don‚Äôt think it will come to that. 
* WE ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT! 
Oh. And the T-Shirts are on hold.,2021-09-30T17:18:09Z
$TNT With speculation on whether it is trading on OTC or not, let‚Äôs just wait official PR from company.,2021-09-30T17:18:06Z
$TNT if anyone has information from IR please post. Source on Yahoo Finance board is saying Cathy from IR told them Peak Group is expecting to be trading again next week. Hoping to confirm this great news. Seems like this will be a blip after all. üòâ,2021-09-30T17:12:13Z
$TNT Looks like its confirmed not trading on OTC because back on NQ shortly. Positive news and Cubeler coming out tonight or in the morning,2021-09-30T17:06:50Z
$TNT We are trading on the OTC ..we‚Äôre back to the same ticker. PKKFF
TD Ameritrade, Thinkorswim regular brokerage and Roth. Showing the correct price. I put an order in to buy shares and it says working.,2021-09-30T17:04:02Z
$TNT once again bulls are wrong‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs trading on OTC lol! Another management mistake,2021-09-30T16:49:01Z
$TNT TNT share investors- your shares apparently will not flip to OTC given the short delay to get re-listed. No need to panic. Company is working hard with SEC and growing revenue. See below response from Peak:,2021-09-30T16:10:19Z
$TNT imagine being an investor and worrying about the damn ticker symbol...Put your big boy pants on and email Investor Relations to get your answers.,2021-09-30T16:10:18Z
