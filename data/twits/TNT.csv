$TNT itâ€™s been a while but nothing like a refresher  
You donâ€™t create wealth by selling a stock for 30-40-50% gains. You create wealth through long term investing   
When you find a wealth creator stock like peak they will say you are wrong. When you hold one they will say you are stupid. When you get rich they will say you got lucky. Gotta love being wrong, stupid, and lucky,2022-01-05T00:23:20Z

$TNT during financing period, long term investors had to endure 4 month long period before rewarded. Itâ€™s been about 3.5 months since delisted from Nasdaqâ€¦i think we are near the tail of the tunnel. Again I am positive that long term investors will be rewarded again.,2022-01-04T22:39:05Z
