$TNT   I cant state strongly enough to ride out any volatility / market pressure.  Quarter after Quarter as revenue / earnings keep going up, so does the stock price.

  With projections by 2023 the way they are for JUST the China arm (the most difficult market to break into, imo) ,,  well ,,  do the math on valuation.

  I had this exact thing happened more than once on stocks, where i bought in on a spike and  the stock price instantly went down for a bit  LOL

 If you think about it , anything even remotely close to these price ranges is crazy low if you are willing to wait for a few quarters to unfold.

  There are people who scored Upstart at 100 bucks right before it took a 50% swing down to $50  LOL ,  that stock is in the mid 200s now on quarterly increases on  rev/ earnings.,2021-09-16T04:20:29Z

@ProspernCapital   me too.  this board will soon be over run.  i‚Äôm just abt done here as a poster.  
 
no change in long status.  just better to observe.

see my post above.   welcome to the world of wall street manipulation, trader wannabees, keyboard junkies, third leg shorts, keyboard jockeys and frankly just a bunch of assholes trying to scratch out a living.

i can only recommend that if you believe, stay patient, disregard the pumpers and the dumpers, and laugh at the just comedy show  that is trying their best to influence your decision.

Disregard stockfam, stocktwits, yahoo, CEO, investor village, etc.

THE ONLY DD worth reading is the PEAL monthly company updates, the company financial statements and the company PRs.   The only DD worth watching is the interviews of JJ.   Then dig for the competitive set and look at their charts, their journey and their opportunity.  might start with SQ, UPST, PYPL, AFRM.  

To be continued....,2021-09-15T22:00:28Z

$TNT A company that is executing perfectly and growing revenues exponentially is being hit by short attacks which by the WILL reverse at any time. Buy hold and be rewarded. Those that are thinking of selling, please sell so we can get on with it. Consolidation is happening and it will come to an end in a narrow trading band, then we fly again higher than $14.5 . Same pattern on thousands of stocks. That‚Äôs why patience always wins in the end when you have a growth stock in a growth industry.,2021-09-15T21:42:08Z
$TNT 2 weeks ago people actually posted good informative shit on here. Now everyone on here seems to be an expert on what the sp is doing in next 5 mins.,2021-09-15T21:16:34Z

$TNT There was a 20m offering as part of the acquisition. Once we&#39;re through those shares, this will continue up.,2021-09-15T19:51:38Z
$TNT At least there is one positive, no dead cat bounce what so ever..so probably more &quot;deals&quot; to be had tomorrow! 
 
Who knows though, maybe like one of the perma-bulls below just said...&quot;this is the bottom no matter what, the mysterious short seller now has to cover and it will go up 25%&quot;,2021-09-15T19:40:13Z
$TNT Would be nice if we could break this downward trend but it may get worse until we get another PR or a big insider or institutional buy,2021-09-15T18:51:01Z

$TNT those who know, know this is being manipulated.  Word on the street is that it&#39;s being shorted for easy money by forcing another PP/offering ..... BUT IT WON&#39;T HAPPEN.   

Cuebler deal next week, pre-arranged US offering, and revised guidance coming means shorts will be completely screwed if they don&#39;t cover it back to $13/14 cdn by end of this week.   We all saw the shenanigans that they pulled from $3 cdn to $2 cdn.......  Except this time they won&#39;t win.,2021-09-15T18:47:52Z

$TNT If you are complaining about the stock price going down, then you shouldn&#39;t be in the stock market.  Markets go up and they go down.  With the strong fundamentals with this company, there should be no worries if you have done your DD.  Yesterday&#39;s news release is an indication as to where we are going.,2021-09-15T17:33:30Z
