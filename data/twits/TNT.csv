$TNT @inverted180 Iâ€™m back from beautiful holidays! Sun and beach and ocean! Wow my macro market outlook turned out to be realâ€¦ do you still think it doesnâ€™t affect Tenet? Anyway, thereâ€™s time to buy that proverbial dip still ;) Iâ€™m not looking for confrontation. In 2023, Iâ€™ll re-evaluate this small holding. May become a bigger holding if it dips furtherâ€¦,2021-12-14T05:31:27Z

$TNT its suspicious when you don&#39;t see a short report or a lawsuit  reminder on Red days. Definitely manipulation and unconscious bias against this company because most revenue is in China despite being a Canadian company and their goal is to be in North America next year.,2021-12-14T04:23:27Z
$TNT We need some news releases related to NA before this will start climbing back to athâ€™s. Thereâ€™s just to much FUD around China right now thatâ€™s causing this downtrend imo.,2021-12-14T02:51:47Z

$TNT --- Didn&#39;t check stock until after close. What happened? Venture capitalists want their profits now?,2021-12-13T23:48:14Z
$TNT  sell off on volume less than 30 day and 60 day avg?  Sell off when it&#39;s way above the 200ma?. ......Ok.   If you&#39;re not accumulating then you&#39;re playing the wrong game.,2021-12-13T22:53:18Z
$TNT now thatâ€™s a sell off,2021-12-13T22:43:31Z
$TNT everything&#39;s red on fed taper and inflation fud. Buy rumor/sell news also operates in the reverse. I suspect the ppl running the show dont want the added political pressure on this flop of an administration and bleeding D party of a severe market correction that will last into 22----

Macro is my specialty ;) 

But of course nothing would surprise these days. Just as a bet and how I&#39;ve watched them start to backtrack unpopular elements I imagine FED fear is mostly fluff and mostly already priced in. 

I predict a very nice Q1 after this BS thinking back to Dec &#39;17----,2021-12-13T21:59:29Z
$TNT I canâ€™t remember the date we got on the NASDAQ but I remember we ran up prior, and then when we got on we ran up even more so I donâ€™t think weâ€™re very much different as we stand right now before that run up. 
I expected this to double, within a month after listing.,2021-12-13T20:58:41Z

$TNT I laugh at how itâ€™s taken them this long just for an uplisting. Meanwhile price has taking a nose dive and any green day gain is gone the next,2021-12-13T19:38:19Z

$TNT heard that end of next week the SEC has a 2 week vacation period hopefully they will finish it before this or we have to wait till new year. It is what it is,2021-12-13T19:21:32Z
$TNT Im long but recent long just before uplist, so I am on the high side.  Just curious the price was much higher on OTC before uplist but we have received great news after great news. Why the big drop? We have more tailwinds than ever.,2021-12-13T19:06:47Z
$TNT wish I had more money too add, but my PF is getting destroyed.. Very, very frustrating time to be in the markets..This relisting has become a burden, despite all the recent good news. You can&#39;t sugarcoat the absolute mess the up listing has caused. SEC don&#39;t trust the Chinese but why should anybody trust them? Dark pools running a mock in the markets, what a joke..,2021-12-13T18:39:07Z
$TNT this is when you buy the dips and look back in 2022,2021-12-13T18:22:42Z

$TNT when do the bulls finally recognize this is a waste of time?,2021-12-13T18:05:53Z
$TNT lmao what are people thinking. Love to sit down with a seller and understand their thought process.,2021-12-13T17:51:16Z
$TNT I bought today,2021-12-13T17:39:39Z

$TNT will add again this are extremely cheap prices,2021-12-13T16:22:22Z
$TNT you can pretty much expect this stock to be red after a green day lol ðŸ˜‚,2021-12-13T15:51:55Z
$TNT,2021-12-13T15:37:10Z
$TNT the boat is sinkingâ€¦. -7%.   Back to 5 before Christmas.,2021-12-13T15:21:43Z
$TNT very very thin ask and bids boths ways ... expect major volatility until more volume comes in,2021-12-13T15:15:58Z
$TNT R.I.P last weeks gains.,2021-12-13T15:15:49Z
$TNT never Nasdaq,2021-12-13T14:52:38Z
