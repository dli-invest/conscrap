$TNT Did some research on SEC reviewing process over the weekend, shared on Discord and sharing here as well:

- There are three different levels of reviews for all files that hit Edgar: Full review, Targeted Review and No Review. Full review checks everything and  involves a team of 2 lawyers and 2 accountants.

- While there isn&#39;t much information on 40-F filing (the one TNT is using), there are plenty of info on S-1 filing (standard filing for IPO). S-1 filing receives an AUTOMATIC full review, and SEC Staff ALWAYS comes back with comments. I believe 40-F receives similar treatment, so comments are normally expected.

- The number of comments can range from 70-80 to a few. The fact that TNT only receives 2-3 comments is good.

- Median time to receive initial comments from SEC staff in 2017 was 26 days. Consider the impact of Covid and the amount of IPO in 2021, I think it is perfectly normal to receive comments on the 30th day for TNT&#39;s filing.,2021-11-29T04:58:44Z
$TNT How about we focus on the fact that the company Stock Price is hugely under  valued! Valuation should be over $16.5 cdn per Zack‚Äôs research, SimplyWallstreet, and shares outstanding to sales at a multiple of 10x which is way under the 30x+ in Fintech.,2021-11-29T04:33:10Z
$TNT I have a feeling we will be on the Nasdick soon.,2021-11-29T04:08:09Z
Big shoutout to the SEC for helping us retail accumulate at these levels. Feels criminal. I added last week and will continue to do so ü§™

‚ÄúFool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me!‚Äù.. I‚Äôm getting rich and there‚Äôs not much else to say about my strategy other than BUY $TNT  ü•∞,2021-11-29T02:00:43Z
$TNT That 40M quarter is being worked on. Guidance will be met. Exponential growth continues. That‚Äôs where my mind is at. Nasdaq, TSX, HK: all coming and so is institutional money. When do you want to get in ‚Ä¶ now or after they‚Äôve bought??,2021-11-29T01:37:21Z

The technical rating of $TNT is bad and it also does not present a quality setup at the moment. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/analyzer/stock/TNT?key=690bddba-1b63-4685-a193-eb53e75e1267&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=TA&amp;utm_content=TNT&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2021-11-28T23:44:00Z
$TNT Media is proving Omicron variant is a nothing burger. We already have the tools and science to deal with it. Markets will rebound and keep their upward trajectory. Covid is a known event, it‚Äôs not what will take the markets down (my opinion). Weee heading into a great spending season that will positively affect the Q4 2020 over Q4 2021 results! They will move the markets upward.,2021-11-28T19:31:49Z

$TNT Never thought I&#39;d be afraid of Greek life, but here we are in Coronavirus world.

I&#39;ll say it again, if this Omicron ends up being the worry that the media is hyping it up to be, then we&#39;re still in the right spot to invest in. Say what you will about Chinese authoritarianism, but they&#39;ve been keeping their citizenry pretty much COVID free while simultaneously continuing to grow their economy.,2021-11-28T12:20:34Z
$TNT People thinking the stock price is going to tank Monday leads me to believe it‚Äôs going to do the exact opposite,2021-11-28T04:04:39Z
Compared to an average Enterprise Value to EBITDA ratio of 31.26, $TNT is valued rather cheaply. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/TNT/fundamental-analysis?key=690bddba-1b63-4685-a193-eb53e75e1267&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=TNT&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2021-11-28T01:14:00Z

$TNT I agree that eyes are on 22 and less on near term catalysts. That is for real price discovery. 14.5 PT are pit stops to 40-50.,2021-11-27T22:54:29Z
$TNT Q4 results that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at. Not the immediate distractions. Nasdaq is inevitable and so is 14.5$,2021-11-27T21:33:46Z
$TNT my friend sent me below (i&#39;m not on discord).... and he said Boss has helped him stay on during the major dips with timely words of conviction.  Much appreciative of what Boss brings.

If anyone knows, Boss knows.,2021-11-27T20:53:31Z
$TNT good to know that the 30 days won‚Äôt start again and won‚Äôt cause a F40 Withdrawal! This means they gotta answer a few questions and they are done so won‚Äôt expect another 30 days probably very fast but it happens when it happens so no expectations,2021-11-27T20:39:35Z
$TNT got an email back from Cathy. She says no to both the 30 days to restart and no to the questions causing a withdrawal of 40F. 

I know some may think they already knew this but I feel any extra assurances are appreciated.,2021-11-27T20:16:41Z
$TNT Reminder that ATH $14.50 was hit pre Nasdaq. Nothing changed. Business is growing and Q4 will be great. Imagine Q4 returning the whole of 2020 revenues! Next year well over $300M. Great. SP completely undervalued compared to fair value 16.5CDN to $109M revenue. That‚Äôs all that matters‚Ä¶SP will catch back up. Relax. And yes it was 50/50 on timing. In the end everyone will be right on Nasdaq and then tsx and HK,2021-11-27T20:12:58Z
$TNT You can‚Äôt white wash the situation by saying ‚Äúknow what you own.‚Äù
That‚Äôs a bunch of baloney, it‚Äôs a big deal getting pushed from the NASDAQ. 
People are going to have concerns and they need to be validated.
It‚Äôs disappointing and annoying and it is what it is, but not holding your shares tight to the vest in my opinion would be a mistake. This is a chance to buy on sale. I‚Äôm more worried about having enough shares than anything else because I truly believe that this is the top stock on my watchlist. For years to come. Cheers ü•Ç,2021-11-27T19:06:03Z
$TNT I don&#39;t get this noise coming from all the forums. I know we all can&#39;t wait for the NASDAQ uplisting to happen, and it&#39;s frustrating that SEC takes a long time. But JJ was clear in the ER that comments from the SEC before the 30 day was a possibility.  All we know that they are working with the SEC, and we are under SEC timeline. I look forward to when the process is finished and to see TNT on the NASDAQ once again. 

The focus should only be on the business. We are still waiting to hear how much revenue was generated from Singles day. The guidance haven&#39;t changed. These are the things that will matter in the end. The future looks bright and i&#39;m damn excited about it.,2021-11-27T18:01:03Z

$TNT this is starting to reek of scam. Couple days before the nasdaq listing debacle ends and the SEC needs MORE information. How convenient.,2021-11-27T15:56:28Z
