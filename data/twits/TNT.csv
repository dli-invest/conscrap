$TNT did anyone else‚Äôs margin get messed up with the name change? Somehow after the change on Monday or Tuesday my margin buying power dropped by a large amount and got margin called for like $600. Then suddenly yesterday it all went back to normal plus the $600 I had to deposit to stop them from liquidating some of my stock.

None of my stocks had any large changes in valuation that should have affected my margin buying power at all.

Just curious if anyone else has had odd issues like that this week. I know TD was having a lot of issues as well.,2021-11-06T13:46:41Z
$TNT Focus should be on the Q3 report this month, not Nasdaq. The business will prove itself yet again with another great quarterly earnings report and provide investors with ‚Äòcolor‚Äô regarding expanding operations. Nasdaq discussions are a distraction to the real story at hand - the growth of Tenet into a B2B Fintech leader.,2021-11-06T02:35:27Z

$TNT Do not miss the boat by trying to time the market.  When we go back on NASDAQ, big fund will take position and then there is no looking back.,2021-11-05T21:26:26Z
$TNT Spoke to IR.  SEC has 30-days to review 40-F.  That would take us to 11/27/2021 (A saturday)  If SEC makes no comment or objection, than NASDAQ will go forward with the uplisting because they already approved it.   TNT would start trading on NASDAQ Nov. 29.   SEC does make an objection require more information than it will take more time.  This we seem unlikely at this point.  The SEC could be &quot;nice&quot; and say &quot;yea.  all good here.  NASAQ go ahead and list TNT&quot; before the 30-days.    We might have to hold our breath until 11/29/21 folks.,2021-11-05T21:25:53Z
$TNT It&#39;s time Tenet investors start accepting realistic time lines.,2021-11-05T21:25:29Z
$TNT absolute fucking train wreck due to the Nasdaq mess,2021-11-05T21:19:12Z
$TNT What‚Äôs amazing is that Cubeler officers, and Peak/Tenet directors accepted the Cubeler payout in Shares of Peak/Tenet. For example the CEO Johnson Joseph was awarded over 2M shares. Do you not think that he and the others know exactly where their business is headed and therefore know that the shares will be worth a lot more than their current exercise value of around 9.x? Indeed, follow management - you follow the inside track. Holding strong.,2021-11-05T20:45:39Z
$TNT Its either 2 things.

1) SEC is performing a diligent review and it takes over a week.

2) SEC found something and has yet to fully complete the review so it‚Äôs not public. However, they have been talking to management about it. Therefore management will drop a bomb on us that they found something and will need to refile.

Likelihood of #2 is small seeing as they were in constant communication with the SEC the entire time and knew what they needed to submit for the approval. If they knew they would not be able to be approved they simply would not have submitted and would have delayed the refilling until they were confident.

End of story.,2021-11-05T20:43:28Z
$TNT Short seller may have done this today. Don&#39;t let them trigger any stop losses. They&#39;re playing on the sentiment that allot of people of spooked about the SEC.

Don&#39;t get spooked, there is no reason to get spooked. Allot of overly anxious people keep giving &quot;any day now&quot; time lines. But did you really buy this stock for an &quot;any day now&quot; moment? No. You bought it to hold it.

If it goes lower tomorrow. Hold.,2021-11-05T20:35:46Z

Any impact here?

$TNT Amid all this selling silliness, I‚Äôm happy waiting for the Q3 results. Not waiting on SEC- since that‚Äôs being worked on and once listed won‚Äôt even be a conversation anyway. Looking forward to TSX and other exchange listings coming out way.,2021-11-05T19:49:59Z
