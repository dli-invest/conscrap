$TNT Zachâ€™s research assumes a very conservative estimate, calculating next yearâ€™s share price using next yearâ€™s revenue guidance.

However, market is forward looking. Next yearâ€™s share price will be based on 2023â€™s revenues, not current. If thats the case then using the same 12.7x multiple, the share price will be around 100CAD,2021-11-18T04:15:56Z

$TNT interesting words from the CEO at the end of the call:
 
QUOTE: &quot;See you next quarter or perhaps we do something out of the ordinary and do a presentation&quot;.

Why not leave it at &#39;see you next quarter&#39;?.  Why does JJ like leaving hints?.  Perhaps.......,2021-11-18T01:31:52Z
$TNT From today&#39;s Analyst report ðŸ§¨:

Management at Tenet Fintech positioned the company for better margins and new business segments in Q3 as it pursues its goal of more than tripling revenues in 2022.

If the companyâ€™s CN$345 million (US$274 million) 2022 guidance is achieved, that stock price could move to $45.00 per share next year.,2021-11-18T01:19:59Z

$TNT  New Zack research report that place value of the stock at $12 U.S. right now. Around 80 percent higher than what it is at present. Like a great deal? This is it. Quit focusing on SEC &quot;approval&quot;. Large, underfunded government agencies work at a snails pace. It is what it is. And not the only route to success. Expansion, growth and revenues will continue. It&#39;s just a matter of time before the share price reflects the true value of the stock. Nothing has changed... we&#39;re just delayed. Early retirement plans may get pushed back three months. And ya know what? I can definitely live with that. Zero worries here. In it for the long haul. And you should be too!,2021-11-17T23:49:14Z

$TNT all of the bears and bear comments crack me up haha Iâ€™m not pumping this stock but also know at some point the value of this stock will catch up to its share price, wait until next earnings are released and they break all previous records for quarterly, yearly and net profit growth !!! canâ€™t wait to hear what the bear argument will be then ðŸ˜‚ cheers to all the longs, the investors here know what they hold and couldn&#39;t be more confident with where this company is going, if I had more money to buy right now I would,2021-11-17T23:04:14Z

$TNT &quot;This quarter was considered to be one of the most important as Tenet enters into a pivotal position for exponential growth in the future, kicking-off all five pillars of our business in full force.&quot;

The crazy thing is Q3 was a good quarter, Nasdaq incoming probably news about this after the 27th of November. And Q4 and 2022 and 2023 hyper growth this will go up

$TNT  sorry guys, if you&#39;re not reading the tape  and seeing the manipulation then it&#39;s your fault.

$TNT shorts and manipulation are why I&#39;ve heavily moved over to the crypto space in recent time--- so bad these days. But, an opportunity is an opportunity. Some of you amateurs can laugh at 5x price targets but you&#39;re arguing against ppl who routinely hit multibaggers within a 12 month timeframe.,2021-11-17T20:32:29Z
$TNT PLEASE, OH PLEASE. Stop PUMPING this stock and post realistic data/forecast.  
I&#39;m sure you all know that the company never actually released guidance of above 30 millions for the third quarter, but everywhere you read you could see 30 millions here, 60 millions there, I even saw a user forecasting 90 millions for the third quarter.... That set up pretty high expectations.  
Then came the actual results of 25 million, which were acceptable(though not stellar) and EVERYBODY (subconsciously) felt disappointed. Basically, all the pumpers set up this quarter for failure!,2021-11-17T20:29:05Z
