$TNT  one thing i&#39;ve noticed is that a few Desjardins manager and senior advisors have &quot;Liked&quot; Luc Godard&#39;s posts on Linkedin.    Tenet is likely working with Desjardins in some aspect., which remains to be seen.    Note, Desjardins is the largest credit union in North America that does insurance, mortgages, etc.,2022-01-30T04:45:17Z

Saw this on CEO , according to globe and mail Peak Fintech (now Tenet) was among the top shorted companies of 2021!   
   
  It even states the estimated damage done over time by the shorting which we came in at -40%.  So apparently we who mentioned this temporary decline was in a big way affected by shorting and manipulation were bang on.   
  
  This was last updated in Oct 2021 for Tenet so not even including up to now, only 10 months of it.  
  
 Feel free to share it on other boards.

$TNT   Really like how each of the recent administrative selections carry almost 2 or more decades of experience. Also, carrying all of the connections and resources they‚Äôve collected along the way. We all know how in business, previous, established relationships can sometimes payoff down the road. Lots of connections with these hires within global banking local and from afar. Definitely setting up an incredible, strong team!,2022-01-28T13:38:57Z
