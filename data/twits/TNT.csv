$TNT JJ said they&#39;ll address the comments from the SEC on Tues/Wed of this week ...... we don&#39;t need a PR for that, i have a feeling the SEC is close to finalizing if that&#39;s the case.,2022-01-14T03:53:12Z

$TNT well after tomorrow if no submission to Edgar regarding their 40-F we can be confident that they told the SEC they had nothing to add. Hoping that‚Äôs the case. Again doesn‚Äôt really matter but does make me happier.,2022-01-13T21:04:53Z

$TNT Luc Godard seems like a perfect fit for what Tenet is trying to achieve, very happy with this hire, especially  with his  international expertise and experience! Ignore the FUD, this stock holds tremendous value, with conservative estimates +300 million revenue and +30 million net profits 2022 LFGO üçª should be way more I know, under promise over deliver üí™üèª Can‚Äôt what for Q4 financials! üöÄ,2022-01-13T20:42:34Z

Grab whatever you can at these rates and prosper!!!!,2022-01-13T16:19:55Z
$TNT TD with the sell walls right now.  

A sell wall is a tool used by a rich individual,or group of rich individuals, to manipulate the price of a stock downwards. A large sell order is set at a specific price by the whale(s) to prevent higher sell orders from executing.  Nobody else can sell above that sell wall price until it&#39;s gone. The result? People need to sell lower than the sell wall in order to liquefy their stock. This drives the price downwards so they can accumulate as much as possible.  

Guess who&#39;s the biggest buyer today so far?.  TD.  Too bad for them, no many are selling.,2022-01-13T15:07:14Z
$TNT Someone with spare time check Tenet&#39;s website for a listing of the Board of Directors, in case I had a stupid moment and didn&#39;t find it. Please.,2022-01-13T14:15:47Z
$TNT For every follower we lose on here I worry that&#39;s one more sad soul that bought high and sold low. Don&#39;t be that guy. It sucks seeing your account down, I know. But it&#39;ll get better soon.,2022-01-13T13:48:25Z
$TNT There is a chance that they don&#39;t need to file F40 coming back to my last post saying expected filing soon. They can also respond with a letter and if that&#39;s the case, Tenet maybe already responded to the SEC with a letter tuesday or wednesday. No hurry for me will hold this investment for years at least 2024-2025 maybe longer.,2022-01-13T13:30:53Z

$TNT crazy action on the tape again today.  Whoever is using cibc keeps taking it down with cibc to cibc trades (cant be a coincidence if it happens over and over again) , they ended up accumulating over 50k shares net , of course it may be higher depending on others using cibc.,2022-01-13T02:42:18Z

$TNT just took position at end of day. wtf was that dump ?,2022-01-12T21:39:29Z
$TNT perusing the MSM headlines today you see downplay of Omicron. Fed no nuke. Biden asking to money printer(def going to keep printing)--- was a rough one but called it as per usual as Macro is my thing. 

Some of you thought lockdowns, Fed nuke, asteroid hitting the planet---- 

If you did I advise to take a look at Cathie Woods write up on small caps, crypto and Fintech--- everything blasted in this artificial correction and realize you&#39;ll want to be in those sectors in the coming months. 

And we await price discovery. Bullish AF here.,2022-01-12T21:33:13Z
$TNT ah there she is. Heading back down to the basement. Classic.,2022-01-12T20:11:07Z
$TNT Expect they file the F40 tonight or tomorrow the last step before the uplisting! This is 100% the last filing before the Nasdaq uplisting gets approved and this is the last time i‚Äôll talk about it

After that Nasdaq obession is done and listed this will fly, The next quartely numbers will be amazing and a lot of pr‚Äôs are coming üöÄ,2022-01-12T18:49:43Z

$TNT got to take a moment to RIP to everyone in the market who panic sold into the bottom bids. Puke into the bottom is the way to wealth they say. 

Everyone&#39;s a macro expert cuz CNN and MSNBC said.... 

Hey wheres our Omicron lockdown and Fed 5% rate hike nuke?,2022-01-12T17:30:06Z
$TNT  fair value without nasdaq is $10.   Whoever was selling blocks in the past few weeks most have finally stopped.  It has to be sheldon.,2022-01-12T17:28:18Z
$TNT Sold some other stocks and finally bought more. Could not resist at these levels. 6K shares strong. For me this is a lot and a very big chunk of my PF.  
 
I am 27 years old and I becoming a millionaire before age 32 doesn&#39;t sound too bad. Not selling a share until 2025 if they keep hitting revenue targets.
