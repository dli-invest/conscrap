$TNT volume each day seems to hit a new high. Q4 results will be ridiculous. By Feb ‚Äò22, all businesses need to be cleaned up financially per China. 

Everyone it‚Äôs Christmas. Snip some egg nog and get ready to bring in the New Year with a boom!!!,2021-12-23T21:19:54Z

$TNT entire portfolio green today, except this one

Hope those CIBC dickheads are investigated,2021-12-23T18:25:22Z
$TNT it&#39;s all good looks like it may stay depressed for a little while longer allowing me to continually add a % from profits from other positions. Itll all culminate in a fat 5-10X. 

I got time bears.,2021-12-23T18:22:57Z
$TNT shorts are keeping this thing just below $6 .. time will come,2021-12-23T18:11:45Z

$TNT what I like is the past few days the volume seems to be much higher and earlier in the day.  We may be ringing in the New Year with some fireworks!,2021-12-23T17:23:40Z
$TNT I seen this posted somewhere today this is really interesting and a good potential catalyst that could catapult us to amazing heights. February /2022 is just around the corner and all insurance brokers in China need to be on a platform that allows for data sharing. Tenets Heartbeat is the system they are flocking to and joining. This vertical is adding to revenues in 2022.
The new regulations, which were implemented on February 1, 2021, essentially require all insurance brokers to have systems that allow them to share data with, and that are directly linked to, the country‚Äôs insurance companies. As the Heartbeat platform is one of only a handful of platforms that offer such capabilities to the Chinese insurance brokerage industry, insurance brokers, who have until February 1, 2022 to comply with the new regulations or run the risk of having to shut down their operations, have been flocking to the platform. Heartbeat is currently linked to China‚Äôs top insurance companies,2021-12-23T16:59:37Z
$TNT @StonkasaurusrexCPA Gave an example not too long ago when he brought up a hypothetical. He asked if you would sell your home for less then what you paid for it simply because other people started knocking on your door and telling you that the price of your home is now less. 

You could apply that example even to an asset you KNOW will depreciate, such as your car.

Sometimes when you&#39;re actively investing, it&#39;s appropriate to sell for a loss. Some reasons could include learning that your companies prospects are much dimmer than what you originally assessed. With Tenet, prospects have only gotten stronger. Q4 results are all but guaranteed to impress. Why would you sell for a loss right now? If you&#39;ve gotten fed up with investing in Tenet, why not wait to make your final decision at least until Q4 results are announced? The only reason I write this post is to talk alittle sense into anyone who might be thinking of doing something quite foolish.,2021-12-23T16:50:34Z
$TNT   Thin sells  and people who want em cheap  lol,2021-12-23T16:16:04Z
$TNT these manipulators are so funny.  Every single day it goes from $6 to $5.85 and they pop it back up to $6    When it breaks $5.85 it goes to $5.68-$5.70 then next day they bring it back up to $6.20ish.    If your adding the $5.68 to $5.75 is a great place.,2021-12-23T15:59:03Z

$TNT Been awhile since I posted but messages like the one posted by  @Fastcapital are simply facts that cannot be ignored!  Games continue to be played with the the SP but that has nothing to do with the company progress‚Ä¶and yes, the SEC delays will get sorted out in due time.  With new verticals coming online, I am looking forward to JJ &amp; team smashing the targeted revenue forecasts for next few years! 

Merry Christmas/Happy holidays to the entire TNT family and I sincerely hope 2022 is a year filled with many blessings! üß®üß®üß®,2021-12-23T15:51:54Z
