$TNT When one oscillator shows a divergence from the stock price it signals a potential trend reversal. When several oscillators show the same divergence its known as confirmation. 

In PKK&#39;s case several oscillators (RSI, MACD, Stochastics, etc) are all showing this bullish divergence confirming a potential bottom and trend reversal üêÆüêÇ,2022-02-01T16:48:48Z

$TNT word is that nasdaq will be announced early next week. the street knows!,2022-02-01T08:28:36Z
$TNT 

When do you speculate/estimate that we get on NASDAQ? I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs quite soon based off of similar Canadian companies that amended 40-Fs despite this company having large operations in China and the new SEC regulations surrounding operations in china.

I enjoy speculation so please let me know in the comments below üòéü¶Ö,2022-02-01T08:06:18Z
$TNT Cubuler lockup expiration tomorrow. No one will sell. Uncertainty around this will go away. Will reverse upwards imo,2022-02-01T04:12:39Z
$TNT falling wedge setup looks prime for a reversal ..... break resistence at $5.30 and $6.00 and it&#39;s face ripping time.  Any nasdaq news will send it.  Good luck my friends.,2022-02-01T04:10:21Z
