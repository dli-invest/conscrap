$TNT JJ expects the company will respond to SEC letter within couple days and then it would be up to the SEC if they needs further disclosure or stamp approval,2022-01-11T04:17:38Z
$TNT imo if I recall doesn&#39;t tsx allow naked shorting . This doesn&#39;t help . On the flip side when peak runs it runs hard.  Hodl .,2022-01-11T03:33:13Z
$TNT no reason to believe that the registration statement won&#39;t be effective, letter came out to Issuers that Tenet has to comply with.  Last letter from SEC is being addressed and Tenet get back in the next day or so that will clear it.   Process has been going well with the SEC, exchanges have been very cordial, .... SEC is just doing their job, everyone will benefit from this.   Let it run its course.,2022-01-11T03:21:39Z

$TNT Just finished watching JJ. Why are people freaking out? The problem with the SP its down to weak emo hands. nothing more! GO TNT!!!!,2022-01-11T02:12:52Z
$TNT I&#39;ve been following stocks for years and the thing I will never understand are all the bashers. Obvious if you are shorting the company, good job you&#39;re making money as the stock price is going down, you should be happy you&#39;re making money, congratulations! To all the investors, add shares as its going down, you&#39;re getting good value on cheaper shares. JJ stated there is no reason he can foresee why they wont get the SEC stamp of approval and you don&#39;t have to be on the Nasdaq to be a successful company, (although I don&#39;t see this as the case) its not the end all be all. I see potential support around 4.90 if it cant sustain current levels and if that breaks 3.90 I will happily swing and buy more shares on the way down. Leave the emotions aside, I know it&#39;s difficult I&#39;ve been there, that&#39;s why we get upset when our home team loses and the stock price dropping feels the same but long term this company has way more positives than negatives going for it.

$TNT Sorry-looking interview.  
As Mark Twain said, you could set a trap anywhere and catch a dozen abler men in a night.,2022-01-11T01:11:31Z
$TNT for anyone who thinks the share price is going to reflect the business or anyone that is doubting thier investment. Go back a couple years. 
The share price was a fraction of today, the doubters and bashers 10 times as thick. Different topics but same BS, It was a very similar vibe then as now. And in 2 years they went from 10 million to 100 million revs and those with conviction were rewarded.

In another 2 years it will go from 100 million to 1 Billion. There will still be doubters and bashers with thier BS but anyone with conviction will get thier reward as well.,2022-01-11T00:41:32Z

$TNT   Man wake me up when all the &quot;when&#39;s Nasdaq&quot; retail is shaken the fuck out.   
 
  Minute by minute clock watchers whining and crying having only themselves to blame for a short term decline in stock price because they are the ones selling  LOL.   
 
 If you cant hang tough until it&#39;s complete then good bye and good riddance!!!  Go buy shit coin and GME you pussies. 
 
  Not holding your little weak hands anymore.  I can only hope that your shares will be gobbled up by real investors that look past the short term. 
 
  &gt;&gt;&gt;   I haven&#39;t seen a company with this kind of execution and guidance AND earning positive on top of that ever!! 
 
   Wahhh  wahhhh   when&#39;s Nasdaq  wahh wahhh   mommy whens Nasdaq?!?   wahhhh wahhh wahhhhhhhhhh 
 
  Either put a cork in it and see where we are in the summer or sell and smell you later you infantile crybabies   ;P,2022-01-11T00:16:56Z
$TNT It&#39;s as if the captain of the plane came on the intercom and said &quot;Attention ladies and gentlemen, we are encountering heavy turbulence. Please fasten your safety belts and keep your trays in the upright position. I intend to ensure that we make it through this, and that you safely reach your destination. Please follow the instructions of our flight attendants.&quot; 

And while most who were nervous were reassured by the captains confidence, the first time flyers turned to each other and said &quot;Oh my God we&#39;re going to crash!&quot;,2022-01-10T23:48:18Z
$TNT scam i told you guys to leave at $8ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡,2022-01-10T23:37:16Z
$TNT For those who would like to get a better understanding of what is going on with the SEC.... 
 
Let me get this straight; as of today, amendments to the 40-F, as per requirement under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, came into effect ? Does that mean it is plausible that there is a certain logic in taking the necessary time to have the form filled in such a way that is consistent with the law? I mean, why revisit and revise a form multiple times without knowing exactly what information, information required by law, would be necessary for a sufficient filing?  
 
I would rather follow what is ratified as opposed to what is interim. 
 
Very good read from 2nd December 2021.

No gloating allowed. ðŸ˜‰,2022-01-10T23:07:44Z

$TNT ask yourself a questionâ€¦.if you never knew this company before and you happen to run into it â€¦.regardless of Nasdaq you listen to JJ interview and read thru all PRs put out by the company in a last year, would you buy the stock?,2022-01-10T22:59:38Z
$TNT sooo..... has ne1 marched on 119 spadina avenue yet or what?... ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,2022-01-10T22:56:53Z
$TNT there wonâ€™t be much float remains when this company listed on TSX, HK regardless of Nasdaqâ€¦and London too,2022-01-10T22:37:27Z
The technical rating of $TNT is bad and it also does not present a quality setup at the moment. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/TNT/technical-analysis?key=690bddba-1b63-4685-a193-eb53e75e1267&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=TA&amp;utm_content=TNT&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-01-10T22:33:00Z

$TNT anyone else wondering where JJ got his sweater from?,2022-01-10T22:04:59Z
$TNT  I love the fact they said today they downplay the actual guidance. Im a big fan of this company I&#39;ll buy more if the share price lowers anymore,2022-01-10T22:01:58Z
$TNT short term might suck but, still very bullish long term. May add along the way. Good  luck guys,2022-01-10T21:30:51Z
$TNT Did I watch the same interview as y&#39;all? The sentiment on this board totally doesn&#39;t match what I got from it. He boosted my resolve. See my previous post...,2022-01-10T21:27:47Z
$TNT &quot;We anticipate that everything will be resolved... what we&#39;ve seen from our dealings with the SEC, there is no reason to believe that at the end of the process our registration statement won&#39;t become effective, which means that we should get back on the NASDAQ... The process has been going well with the SEC, the exchanges have been very cordial... I ask everyone to be patient... The process is running it&#39;s course, let&#39;s just let it run it&#39;s course. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s going to be a week, two weeks, a month or 60 days, I do not know at this point. But at the end of the day, I think what they&#39;re doing is a good thing and will benefit everyone.&quot; -JJ speaking on NASDAQ.,2022-01-10T21:23:52Z
$TNT don&#39;t like to say: told you so... but you know... told you so... still Bullish anyway, Tenet is my retirement plan and I&#39;m still young ðŸ˜Ž... vision 2030 TNT,2022-01-10T21:22:07Z
