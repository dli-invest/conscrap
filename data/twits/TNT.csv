$TNT If everyone remembers when they last hiked the rates back in 2018(?), this isn‚Äôt the end. The market will probably drop another 10%. Maybe a run up first for a week or two in February.,2022-01-27T02:43:53Z

$TNT fintech multiples have a median EV/TTM Revenue multiple of 15x. The multiple had a slight drop in the first half of the year, but rebounded in the latter half, reaching its highest level in 2 years. 

EOY we are at 1x multiple

$TNT Too many whiners and gamblers here spreading disaproval of recent stock movement. If you want instant gratification, sell and use the proceeds to purchase lottery tickets. Investors invest in good companies and wait. Time is their friend.,2022-01-26T15:57:36Z

$TNT   This is about as volatile as it gets,  many holding cash through, others tightening their grip on worthy stocks.   
 
   Keep those hatches battened down and ride out the storm folks. If it helps, review your DD as to why you got into the company in the first place and realize nothing has changed. 
 
   In fact the execution continues even more then it ever has. If you can hang in there instead of watching the entire market going through this you will come out ahead.  
Am I happy about all this crap?  Am I crying and complaining?  What will that accomplish? 
 
   Investors have the ability to look at the whole picture, YoY ,  not hour over hour. 
 
  If you think it will be like this forever and ever and ever then you letting times like these get under your skin.  
 
   Not going to post the strong fundamentals here yet again, you all should know them unless you did no DD (which I find hard to stomach) 
 
  These shares are a valuable,  strong growth always wins in the long run.,2022-01-26T10:55:25Z

Some motivation for y‚Äôall: If CEO JJ had not paid a single penny for the 433,506 shares of $TNT he owned prior to the Cubeler acquisition payout (attached), his average cost would be $8.09. Like he said last year- enjoy the ride‚Ä¶ üê∏,2022-01-26T01:46:02Z

$TNT I hope we get some excellent 4th qtr numbers cuz this stock‚Äôs price action is horrible.,2022-01-26T00:13:12Z
$TNT 
So I just rewatched the last interview JJ did. Does anyone else find it strange that when asked about why people would make up and spread lies about a stock, he acted very confused about the motives of such people? He never seemed to even consider shorts could be behind it. Just seems strange is all.,2022-01-25T22:47:03Z
$TNT seems like NASDAQ listing is a pipe dream at this point. Honestly I support these law firms suing the company,2022-01-25T22:07:26Z
$TNT let‚Äôs get one positive thing out of SEC period. That the Nasdaq hasn‚Äôt been approved this week in these red markets wouldn‚Äôt have way less impact üòÜ.,2022-01-25T21:29:40Z

$TNT continues to get good news and recruiting impressive personell for the future. Setting up nicely, the SP does not reflect the company. Know one likes uncertainty but I&#39;m confident relisting news will happen shortly and then uptrend will start.,2022-01-25T18:32:54Z
