$TNT Someone made this comment and very valid. Yes the SEC has been a pain in the arse, but if it was a ‚Äúscam‚Äù or had major issues wouldn‚Äôt SEC have shut them down by now and moved on?

As Axl Rose once sang, ‚Äúall you need is paytience, yeaaah yeaaaaaah‚Äù,2022-01-08T22:29:25Z
$TNT It‚Äôs crazy that retail investors are being mislead, literally scared out of their investment as some bad actors are crying the sky is falling or this is a scam - IT&#39;S NOT!!!!  

DD clearly helps build confidence.  I&#39;m no pro investor, actually far from it
but when a company is already
profitable &amp; are experiencing
exponential growth &amp; affiliating with
massive entities such as: Chinese
Government (Financial centres),
PetroChina, Sinopec, COFCO,
corporate.jd.com/home, BJM, Ping An,
Ehi, Gruppo Coin, ShopEx, UnionPay/
Rongbang, XGL, Xiamen Guangzhui Ltd.
BDC, Dajinpengli, Bianlifeng, Xingcheng
Special Steel Works, YouCKU, &amp; more then this clearly proves company legitimacy.

Tenet is hitting their revenue projections &amp; will continue to revise  revenues upward as they expand inChina, North America, &amp; beyond! Recognize this isn&#39;t a one trick pony, they now have 5 clear revenue verticals that will generate billions in the coming years.

If you choose to invest in Tenet or not, GLTA!,2022-01-08T20:53:59Z
$TNT If you want something crazy to consider over the weekend, consider that the last time Tenet traded at this price was August.  Then consider where Tenet was business-wise at that time.  Then consider that Tenet was considered undervalued at the time. Then consider the pillars (petrol, insurance, clean tech), partnerships (Ping an, YouCKU, UnionPay, PetroChina) and business execution (revised guidance, singles day, Red Bull expansion, petro pilot) that have been announced since then.  Then have a beer.,2022-01-08T20:07:40Z
$TNT why are you guys panicking? The sp has only dropped 55% in a few months, got delisted from the nasdaq we re rocking and rolling. No need to make noiseü§°ü§°,2022-01-08T20:01:27Z
$TNT NASDAQ is just NASDAQ y‚Äôall. Company progress is what you invest in. They‚Äôre growing more than 200% 2021 and another 200% in 2023. And that‚Äôs still conservative with all the deals they made last few months. We‚Äôre not even talking about North America, South America and Europe just yet,2022-01-08T19:08:17Z
$TNT I never post on here at all but stop worrying about the Nasdaq and just trust the company which is making huge strides ,it&#39;s going to happen just chill and block out the noise,2022-01-08T18:45:42Z
$TNT Honestly, there is way to much focus on the SEC and not enough on company fundamentals.  The company is executing as can be seen by the many recent news releases, those clearly spreading FUD are promptly blocked which makes for light reading.  Spare me any cool-aid comments, I invest my $ in companies making real progress, generating real revenue, with a real growth strategy and Tenet is one such company.  We up-list when it happens, and for those new, do your own DD! GLTA üß®,2022-01-08T16:30:12Z

$TNT,2022-01-08T15:34:51Z
$TNT It seems logical to me that if I were an investor in Tenet and happened to own/operate a Canadian SME, I would sign up for Cubeler.

Vice versa

If I were a Canadian SME owner/operater who ended up using Cubeler, I would at least consider investing in Tenet.,2022-01-08T15:10:25Z
$TNT Are there any Canadian Small Business owners who have signed on to Cubeler and can speak on it here? Maybe give us some screenshots of the interior of the site? I considered signing up but I&#39;m not a Canadian Small Business owner, so I would simply be a lookie loo wasting their data and time.,2022-01-08T15:05:22Z
$TNT When JJ gives clarity monday of how they are cooperating with the SEC and touching all the points of F40 we will go up and rebound Nasdaq Immiment! This is the rebound and new highs will arise!,2022-01-08T14:22:30Z
$TNT Monday up or down?,2022-01-08T14:05:36Z

The technical rating of $TNT is bad and it also does not present a quality setup at the moment. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/TNT/technical-analysis?key=690bddba-1b63-4685-a193-eb53e75e1267&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=TA&amp;utm_content=TNT&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-01-08T01:34:00Z

$TNT afternoon got crazy at work so just just checked my account for the first time since like 10:30. Definitely a nice surprise but what happened?,2022-01-07T22:49:48Z
$TNT,2022-01-07T22:36:36Z
$TNT Anyone notice the basement dwelling bashers that were running rampant this morning/early afternoon during the price drop are all of a sudden silent and haven&#39;t acknowledged the price rise?  You&#39;d think they&#39;d expresses just a bit of optimism because you know...they care of course and supposedly have skin in the game.,2022-01-07T21:47:21Z
$TNT Still holding all shares from the first time we were PKKFF in the Roths. Added last two days in the trading account mid and low 4&#39;s. Just going keep letting them all marinate.,2022-01-07T21:42:25Z
$TNT something to understand: Monday will be a disappointment for anyone thinking they will give a clear answer about NASDAQ... I can already tell you the answer provided on Monday about NASDAQ: it&#39;s coming... now just Hold your share that you bought today and don&#39;t you dare sell them on monday at 9:31am!!,2022-01-07T21:39:29Z

Never, ever, during your trials and testings.

It was then that I carried you.&quot;,2022-01-07T21:31:20Z
