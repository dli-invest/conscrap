$TNT for this stock to be up on a down day is very telling. Great news on the upward forecast revision!! This stock will double in 12-18months.,2021-10-22T15:31:45Z
$TNT Anyone else not able to sell some shares? Under PKKFF, can&#39;t. Under TNT, not found. *Fidelity,2021-10-22T15:28:16Z
$TNT revenue is great but profits are what really moves a stock.. over 50 million net income for 2022.. 😳 sweet baby Jesus! over 200 million profit - 2023 still think these numbers are conservative but $@&amp;! damn,2021-10-22T15:21:31Z
$TNT How do you guys think a rising rate environment will affect Peak&#39;s business?,2021-10-22T15:08:55Z
$TNT Bought more Peak @ $9.10 w/ my Trump profits,2021-10-22T14:52:14Z
$TNT Great numbers from guidance , going to be an exciting few years. Management just needs to hit their estimates QoQ (which they have an excellent track record of doing) and the market recognizing the value here in share price is a matter of “when” not “if”. Top line more important here in hyper growth tech like Peak but the idea of having paid $300M for a company that will provide me $200M in net income in a few years is with this kind of growth is unreal. I think Management is being super conservative on 2021 top line and still feel this number will land closer to $150 (they probably don’t want to make assumptions on how singles day will go in Q4). Management is thinking about being back on Nasdaq and wanting to blow out 2021 estimates so the Street has no choice but to pay attention to Peak; which is smart.,2021-10-22T14:33:23Z
$TNT Its unfortunate this wasn&#39;t released after Nasdaq up-list, there is absolutely no volume.,2021-10-22T14:03:53Z
$TNT liked what I saw in the guidance, looking forward to see Q3 earnings and of course relisted on the nasdaq.,2021-10-22T14:03:28Z
$TNT 

Revenue upward revision increases:
2021: +4.8%
2022: +13.1%
3023: +30%

Net income revision increase (decreases):
2021: -21.4%
2022: +41.6%
2023: +100%

Wouldn’t get distracted by the (small) net income downward revision, we’re only talking $1.2m less than before that management didn’t account for, could be a in part due to nasdaq delisting issues, like more legal and compliance fees they weren’t expecting.

The most important number here is 2022 revenue guidance in my opinion, revised upwards by 13.1%. What’s most impressive is the net income figure for 2023 revised almost 2x higher than the previous one. This leads me to think that there’s a lot of cost synergies from their acquisitions rather than sales synergies - this is precisely what we talked about in our first PKK valuation report. We mentioned how Cubeler’s acquisition would create cost efficiencies for Peak (link in comments).,2021-10-22T13:58:26Z
$TNT should end 20% up today I mean 15x undervalued at 2023 levels,2021-10-22T13:47:12Z
$TNT friendly update: 11.70$ CAD at 9:40am. The SQUEEZE is Happening now! 🚀,2021-10-22T13:42:07Z
$TNT @StockGuruJr please give us the bearish statement of the day, thanks!,2021-10-22T13:40:15Z
$TNT 

Sooo  This is just based on the current foundation that  Peak is confident about.  Anyone wanna bet it will need to be updated a few more times at the rate they build and once we really see it take off?  Probably see expansion to new countries too in that time frame!,2021-10-22T13:38:32Z
$TNT With this new guidance - we need to be back to Nasdaq..... this will fly like upstart,2021-10-22T13:29:43Z

$PKKFF $TNT PEAK Financial Updated Guidance! 🚀,2021-10-22T13:27:10Z
$TNT so how is everyone liking the guidance?,2021-10-22T13:18:10Z
$TNT a look at how far we come. We will likely do 55m in Q3 or Q4 this year. Back in 2020 they were projecting that for the whole 2021. That’s explosive growth 🧨🧨🧨,2021-10-22T13:11:39Z
$TNT beautiful way to start a friday,2021-10-22T13:10:00Z
$TNT ,2021-10-22T13:09:02Z
$TNT Fantastic revenue guidance - Congrats longs 🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨,2021-10-22T13:08:31Z
$TNT the data monetization is not in the forecasts yet. That will account for a 1/3 of the revenue by 2023. Unreal!!! 🧨🧨🧨,2021-10-22T13:07:05Z
$TNT $800M revenue for a $700M market cap company that is insane of you look at the multiple for Fintech it is 15x https://finerva.com/report/fintech-2021-valuation-multiples/ This is easily a 15x,2021-10-22T12:51:17Z
$TNT Ok we are up pre market! Shorts are gonna have to cover. Let’s squeeze and nobody sell at all or atleast till afternoon if you must. 🚀 💎 🚀 Great conservative numbers!,2021-10-22T12:43:37Z
$TNT @SirJohn1 Yup yup I read that too and I like 2023 but just offering a little push back on 2021 numbers and perhaps 2022. What I’m getting at is also a lot of people had a bit higher predictions here but those numbers I think included more things that JJ is prudently choosing not to include. So to your point I’ll concede that perhaps sandbagging wasn’t the right word to use. Just poking small holes but you know what we have some good clarity not and these numbers will easily be beat! 🚀 GLTA cheers 🍻 !,2021-10-22T12:38:52Z
$TNT &quot;until that happens&quot;,2021-10-22T12:33:44Z
$TNT @SpanishLullaby27 I wouldn&#39;t say that a DOUBLING of net income for 2023 is sandbagging. Plus, they are saying that the forecasts will be revised again to include data monetization. Read the NR: &quot;Until that happens, we have revised our revenue guidance upward by 5% for 2021, 13% for 2022 and 30% for 2023.&quot;,2021-10-22T12:33:19Z
$TNT it seems like maybe they Sandbagged the numbers a bit. So JJ is already letting investors know they will have to revise up again when they get NA open and also their consumer focused Apps ready (think Upstart) and then numbers will take off more. Can someone take this board thru the numbers and maybe explain it better than me. GLTA,2021-10-22T12:30:29Z
$TNT This guidance will be revised UP as North America ramps.,2021-10-22T12:17:39Z
$TNT Wow, 100% increase of net income in 2023 for the new forecasts. Margins through the roof with the NA expansion,2021-10-22T12:15:26Z
