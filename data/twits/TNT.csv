$TNT still mind blown that a new growth company generating over 100mm can do it with positive net income, almost unheard of.   While other companies continue to ramp up losses QoQ like Jumia, tnt continues to ramp up revenue and positive income.  Just watch,2021-11-17T05:01:29Z

Did I miss the part when jj said where the hell my shirt was?,2021-11-17T04:25:27Z
$TNT 5 pillars of Tenet, 
1-Consumer Goods (currently running in China. Soon North America)
2- Oil and Gas just came on line this quarter
3- Insurance just came online this quarter
4- Clean tech (surprise info in the near or medium future) in the works
5- International growth, Canada starting this year end and USA 2022. The Data to be monetized, future of this company pillars.

Nasdaq on its way by around November 27th. TSX, Hong Kong Exchange.

With 1 of the pillars currently firing - they have managed to grow the business exponentially! Image now with Oil &amp; Gas, Insurance, and Clean Tech…no wonder they upped the guidance to $345M in 2022.,2021-11-17T03:06:00Z
$TNT I dont know if anyone decided to join up with PHIL because of Seanpmo due to people cross posting but I highly recommend doing DD as this is a good example of why its important.

Just wanted to ensure anyone who saw it and jumped on that board at least they can possibly have all the information needed.

$TNT He finished the call with saying to see you on the next earnings call, and he said UNLESS we have some surprises. I think he has something..,2021-11-16T23:51:02Z
$TNT I have seen this &#39;Tactic&#39; now used several times.
Good news though .. I now know, they only do this to the best, &quot;about to pop&quot; companies !

The blatant &quot;Hatchet Piece&quot;, on our company is the same modus operandi that hit SAVA.  or the amateurs that did it to GPV &amp; MP.  ( easy to see the historic pr&#39;s) 

The PR piece, timed with a Legal firm ready to jump in  and &quot;Represent the Shareholders &quot; !    .. is getting old

So yesterday,  Pomerantz must have been ready with someone&#39;s finger on the mouse to push their Bogus claim, minutes later to be one-up on TNR&#39;s PR 

...  THIS IS WHITE COLLAR *   ORGANIZED CRIME ... 

* Meaning Lawyers know the gray area to f#ck with us.,2021-11-16T23:37:34Z
$TNT Investor call was bullish. Nothing to be concerned about…but we knew that already,2021-11-16T23:28:28Z
$TNT From a Discord summary: 
Look at it this way. If Single&#39;s day is 6M, we know Oil &amp; Gas was 6M. Even assuming flat growth between Q3 and Q4 which is highly unlikely. But assuming no revenue growth other than those two verticals then it&#39;s 25.7 + 6 + 6  that&#39;s 37.7M ...basically guidance...now is it reasonable that NO growth has happened or that the company doesn&#39;t generate any more revenue from oil &amp; gas when JJ just said &quot;it&#39;s passed the pilot stage&quot;…,2021-11-16T23:26:11Z
$TNT No we do not want you to buy back stock. I believe everybody feels the same?,2021-11-16T23:15:10Z
$TNT wheres a link to the call,2021-11-16T22:58:56Z
$TNT Great call …I always feel like JJ appreciates us❣️,2021-11-16T22:57:38Z
$TNT that call made me feel better,  cant wait until options become available going to load up,2021-11-16T22:56:54Z
$TNT After that earnings call, can&#39;t wait to see what else is in store.  Three pillars (Supply chain, Insurance and Steel) running at 100% by the end of Q4 and the other two (Oil and Gas and Clean Tech) starting to run at 100% next year.  JJ couldn&#39;t stop smiling.   Management is doing an amazing job and executing on all levels.  If you don&#39;t like what they are doing, you have some options, sell your stock and stop following the company or when a vote comes out to change the management team put in your vote to change it.  However, I am not sure how far your share count will take you.,2021-11-16T22:52:04Z

$TNT Great opening by JJ on first few questions where he put to bed:

1. Any concerns over Nasdaq
2. The nonsense posted here and elsewhere by immature investors that Q3 was a bad quarter.,2021-11-16T22:05:40Z
$TNT from JJ himself in conference call Q&amp;A, he mentioned that 27 Nov is the last day SEC have to give comments before uplisting.,2021-11-16T22:00:10Z

JJ:  Q3 is in line with what we expected.  We put guidance out knowing what Q3 will be like,2021-11-16T21:54:33Z
$TNT couldn’t dial in, no updates yet???,2021-11-16T21:50:41Z
$TNT Glad to see that the $9.25 support held today, but I&#39;m not surprised. Spent the last of my sideline money today. I firmly believe today was a weak hand shakeout. 

Do you have enough patience to wait for the Q4 results? I do.,2021-11-16T21:26:31Z
$TNT Who else will be on the call?,2021-11-16T21:21:10Z
