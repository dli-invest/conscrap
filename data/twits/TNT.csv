Some motivation for y‚Äôall: If CEO JJ had not paid a single penny for the 433,506 shares of $TNT he owned prior to the Cubeler acquisition payout (attached), his average cost would be $8.09. Like he said last year- enjoy the ride‚Ä¶ üê∏,2022-01-26T01:46:02Z
$TNT Not happy I‚Äôm down 40% but I‚Äôm adding steady,2022-01-26T01:03:17Z
$TNT I hope we get some excellent 4th qtr numbers cuz this stock‚Äôs price action is horrible.,2022-01-26T00:13:12Z
$TNT 
So I just rewatched the last interview JJ did. Does anyone else find it strange that when asked about why people would make up and spread lies about a stock, he acted very confused about the motives of such people? He never seemed to even consider shorts could be behind it. Just seems strange is all.,2022-01-25T22:47:03Z
$TNT seems like NASDAQ listing is a pipe dream at this point. Honestly I support these law firms suing the company,2022-01-25T22:07:26Z
$TNT let‚Äôs get one positive thing out of SEC period. That the Nasdaq hasn‚Äôt been approved this week in these red markets wouldn‚Äôt have way less impact üòÜ.,2022-01-25T21:29:40Z

$TNT Had to add some today, wish I had more to invest.,2022-01-25T21:08:07Z
$TNT Such a disappointing finish. This should be no less than $6 yet finishes below $5. This whole market is sad, we already know interest rates are coming, yet two weeks of a bloodbath.,2022-01-25T21:05:13Z

$TNT  market rebounding but we keep dropping on high volume. I‚Äôm long but this is getting frustrating, sec news can‚Äôt come quick enough,2022-01-25T18:36:37Z
$TNT continues to get good news and recruiting impressive personell for the future. Setting up nicely, the SP does not reflect the company. Know one likes uncertainty but I&#39;m confident relisting news will happen shortly and then uptrend will start.,2022-01-25T18:32:54Z

$TNT Under $4? Ok, twist my arm 500 more shares.,2022-01-25T17:53:48Z
$TNT just needs to hold stable during this turbulent time, get the NASDAQ approval to avoid not meeting guidance, and execute behind the scenes. When the dust settles we should all be laughing.,2022-01-25T16:32:56Z
