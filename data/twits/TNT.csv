$TNT So a tradition in the states is to have what we call a ‚Äúshout box‚Äù so tomorrow during the shareholder meeting we just post what we think while it‚Äôs being said.
I can‚Äôt wait! Should be very interestingüß®,2021-10-26T21:23:14Z
$TNT Ask yourself one question‚Ä¶ Are Peak‚Äôs revenues growing at a high rate of growth? Yes they are. Case closed. Hold and be rewarded. This SEC narrative will pass, and it will re-list on Nasdaq just as China/US trade relations narrative comes back into positive light.

$TNT The Grizzly Report is out again with another bogus report, This time going after $MP and Chamath. $IPOF  $IPO  If I remember correctly, it‚Äôs not one of Chamath‚Äôs SPAC‚Äôs .

$TNT hey, I received an email from
Barry as well. He wanted me to send $10k to him so he could return from Africa and share the treasures he accumulated during his time as a Nigerian prince.

I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs a different Barry, but I‚Äôll ask him about NASDAQ just in case he‚Äôs heard anything.,2021-10-26T13:04:01Z

$TNT got an email from Barry this evening. Pretty much restating what doorknob posted earlier from discord.  Sounds promising for next week, but we shall wait and see!,2021-10-26T01:38:23Z

$TNT My only regret thus far is using my dry powder to chase a so called squeeze in ATER. This is what I should have used to double down on TNT. This is a forward looking stock and I will soon go all in.,2021-10-25T15:57:08Z
$TNT 500 more shares. Will buy every week until NASDAQ.
