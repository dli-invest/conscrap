$TNT when is q4 ER,2022-02-17T00:40:49Z
$TNT if this Nasdaq relist takes another month expect projections to be lowered and NA expansion to grind to a halt. This hyper growth company making less rev Q2 to Q3, getting delisted from the Nasdaq, having the big dogs be able to copy their business model easily and also the Chinese government being able to stop there business entirely whenever they feel like it things aren&#39;t looking good. Also looking at the charts this thing is in a legit free fall and wouldn&#39;t meet the Nasdaq requirements if they had to re apply, very sad.,2022-02-17T00:40:18Z
$TNT Anyone know if the SEC has commented on amendment 3 yet?,2022-02-17T00:25:52Z
$TNT $3 soon,2022-02-16T22:32:12Z
$TNT averaged down,2022-02-16T21:25:16Z
$TNT put an order in for 2000 @ $4CDN. Unbelievably lower than my original average price pre R/S. This company is executing and won‚Äôt be at these levels for much longer.,2022-02-16T21:23:59Z
$TNT ‚Ä¶.doorknob ‚ÄúAs far as share price goes , think of it as getting to point A  , B  and even C.. as an investor of course. From all the narrative from the CEO he says that the company really will not be running on all cylinders till around mid to late 2024. Reason he gives, is that is when the data and adoption rates from the 5 pillars become a major source of all revenues.  I would call that time frame point A.   In my earlier posts i already indicated that getting to point A .. even with a crummy first private placement the share price still remains very high , because there will be a series of placements . The company indicated this in interviews many ways . The share count is quite low now fully diluted at 120 million shares roughly. They have been very efficient in keeping it low even though we never really have any debt or long term liabilities , by using shares to acquire cubeler and many other programs, partners , cash etc. At point A . I SEE possibly a share price of $112 .,2022-02-16T21:16:44Z

$TNT markets are green, UPST killing it and yet this is testing new lows. Such a disappointment,2022-02-16T20:45:41Z

$TNT  can anyone find a canadian company that submitted a 40FR12B amendment and never got uplisted?.  I&#39;ve found 5 companies over the past 1 year who have submitted at least 1 40FR12B amendment and they all got SEC effective notice at some point.... that&#39;s 100%.  I&#39;ll share a chart later tonight when i have a chance.,2022-02-16T17:10:18Z

$TNT Have been able to accumulate and increase my position by 10% over the past month. Share price decline has been frustrating for everyone including myself , but would have never been able to accumulate this many more shares without it. Remember that if you believe in your investment thesis on Tenet, then Tenet will eventually start trading in multiples similar to other similar fintechs, which means price will move up much faster from these levels when price discovery finally happens (and converge to where it would have been without Nasdaq delay) and that the Nasdaq delay will ultimately be irrelevant and just a blip in the story.,2022-02-16T16:08:15Z
$TNT I find it hard to believe management is being kept in complete darkness with the SEC‚Ä¶ hopefully in the coming days we know more. 

And for the ‚Äúidiots‚Äù that say NASDAQ is not the goal or we should stop talking about it‚Ä¶ if we don‚Äôt get on the NASDAQ by end of the quarter (presumably in the next couple weeks) they won‚Äôt get the financing they need to meet 2022 guidance, and we all know what that means.,2022-02-16T15:56:00Z
$TNT My prediction is a 15% to 30% jump come Q4 earnings and a gradual increase to $10 per share by the summer. I believe TNT will list on the TSX first before they get onto Nasdaq,2022-02-16T13:01:40Z
$TNT hope that UPST earnings lights a üî• here!,2022-02-16T01:43:27Z

$TNT upst absolutely flying. This will be us in a year..,2022-02-15T21:28:52Z
$TNT wow look at Upstart. They absolutely crushed earnings. This model that UPST and Tenet use for loan procurement is the future. Very easy to see this,2022-02-15T21:28:37Z
$TNT lmfao. Upstart goes crazy. We are stuck. Macro and industry wide issues have nothing to do with this collapse. This is a junk company.,2022-02-15T21:15:51Z
$TNT  @ Johnny  ,  looks more like not much for sells but low bids at work actually.,2022-02-15T19:24:42Z
$TNT Seems like they let this get bought up each morning from the people that want &quot;cheap shares&quot; then the people that want to dump theirs start unloading in the afternoon. Like clock work.  
 
I&#39;m going to be forced to average down, but still doesn&#39;t look like time yet.,2022-02-15T19:21:58Z
