$TNT i&#39;m guessing conservatively b/w $36-$38 mm ..... Positive net income.  Should be in the 40s for Q4.,2021-11-13T01:47:15Z
$TNT  Solid day today :)  

   Keep in mind for Q3 Monday the guidance for Q3 and Q4 combined is approx. 64 mill with an upside on the positive earnings end. 

 My guess would be a little lower this one then a little higher Q4 to make up that 64 number. They are in the middle of expansion and hiring etc. too so expenses up a bit higher Q3 and Q4 as well.

  Next years guidance is WAY higher so that , imo , is where we will begin to see the massive increases.,2021-11-13T01:35:38Z
$TNT Monday Q3 numbers will be coming out.  If we make 30 Million plus we are golden.  I am shooting for around 60 Million as a top end.  Anything above 30M is amazing!,2021-11-12T22:38:55Z

$TNT 

What‚Äôs your average after listing, delisting, OTC lockout etc‚Ä¶.

I‚Äôve averaged both up and down - 

As of now average $8.33

Unable to go lower since none of the three trading platforms I‚Äôm using will allow purchases of Tenet - liquidation only.

This includes the dickheads at Tradestation who said ‚ÄúOperations can stop any stock trade, and they don‚Äôt need a reason and don‚Äôt have to explain the decision‚Äù.,2021-11-12T21:11:26Z

$TNT These margin requirements from Fidelity are no fun especially with the low daily volume traded, the risk profiles change dramatically.   Look forward to #Nasdaq daily volumes.,2021-11-11T21:53:14Z

$TNT if we won‚Äôt get a fast approval and they review the document till the deadline we get automatically approved after the 27th.

We just need to be patient and maybe hope they will finish the review before this timeline. Don‚Äôt expect they finish earlier because they SEC is a slow government institution. These kinda institutions always take their time they don‚Äôt care about investors and the stock price,2021-11-11T20:30:03Z
During Q2, $TNT opened offices in both Guangzhou and Beijing. Oil and gas pilot project took place near the Port of Guangdong with some of the world‚Äôs biggest oil companies. China claims home to 7 of the top 10 biggest ports in world, one of which also happens to be in Beijing. A deal with BP, Sinopec, and/or Petro China would be worth #Billions,2021-11-11T20:15:43Z

$TNT staying to conviction and seeing the results in the future is not only satisfying, but how you attain financial freedom. 4 or 5 multibag winners that you were piled in puts you in the top 1% fast ~~ dont miss your spot if on fence this sector is explosive and we have a real item here held back only by a debunked short &amp; distort that didn&#39;t even hammer the stock price as they anticipated. 

The shorts will move along shortly or get incinerated as was the case on several of my recent positions. 

Likewise anybody here that also is in the crypto space you should expect a large winter surge and then a crypto winter --- so all of those profits(take them accordingly) will need to see good use and fintech is just starting to roar. 

Bears I have no time for you---- instablock on sight.,2021-11-11T18:53:13Z
$TNT The Insurance 100 2020 report ranking shows Ping An&#39;s brand value increased 20% year on year to USD60.6 billion. This has consolidated Ping An&#39;s leadership position as it has retained the top spot as the world&#39;s most valuable insurance brand for the fourth year in a row.
