$TNT I am introducing @gamblerjag  ‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs been my good friend for a long time and is thinking about investing some very serious money. He wants to know who my favorite people are here. I told him there‚Äôs so many good people on this thread..it is like no other thread on Stocktwits. Say üëã,2022-02-27T03:54:31Z
$TNT Select Russian banks will be blocked from SWIFT. I believe the dramatic rebound we saw Friday was due to investors seeing that Russia had been spared from this during the first round of sanctions. 

Personally I applaud the decision. It may cause more financial pain for all of us but some things are more important and besides, long term we&#39;ll still do fine.

$TNT I highly think SEC has responded. It‚Äôs more likely that they have than they have not (considering the uncharacteristic time since the last submission) 

I believe Tenet is completing the last portion of what SEC has asked for. They get an informal approval through their behind the scenes communication w their SEC rep that, yes, Everything is now completed to their satisfaction. 

They attach the latest news releases and any other addendums / exhibits and we submit one last 40 F amendment to EDGAR. This last one will in a day or two have SEC sign off.  (Since it‚Äôs just a formality and it‚Äôs all
Been checked off) 

Another person had shared a wild back on a different forum comparables somewhat of other companies having gone though something similar and the Nasdaq re-approval so to speak comes a couple days (or even a day) after SEC effectiveness. 

Hope I‚Äôm right. We are due on this matter and I think the time for the great news has come.,2022-02-26T14:46:53Z

$TNT Until we get over the mid 5&#39;s and hold this is a dead cat bounce. Best case scenario nasdaq is announced, but it would be nice if the stock goes sideways and builds a base at least.,2022-02-25T16:31:51Z

$TNT What a Great Buying opportunity today, not to be insensitive to Ukrainian folks but it was a Bearish opportunity for the Stock Market and to pull a ‚ÄúBullish Trigger‚Äù, though the US Government imposed sanctions against Russia, look for another Bearish/Bullish opportunity as China nears the attempt to takeover Taiwan.,2022-02-24T23:45:24Z
