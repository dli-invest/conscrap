$TNT so I guess the big question is whether they have already recently responded to the SEC comment from Dec 7 or if it‚Äôs a work in progress and perhaps colour on what the comments were and if they foresee any further challenges. I hope we get some visibility tomorrow.,2022-01-10T05:25:00Z
$TNT &quot;During the period, the Issuer introduced the beta version of a new technology platform to help build, manage and fund clean tech projects and held meetings with a couple of engineering firms to form partnerships to potentially bid on projects ranging from single plant commercial projects to large scale infrastructure projects.&quot;,2022-01-10T04:52:12Z

$TNT Hey guys, I wanted to share a document that user Keir had posted to Stock Fam. He did an amazing job and condensing all press releases and news since 2020. It is in chronological order from newest to old. Take a minute to look through. 
 
It is impressive the amount of work that Tenet has done in a short period of time.

$TNT Tenet may be pretty much all retail, but we have a very bullish and committed base. The overwhelming majority are committed to the long term. I intend to make these institutional investors buy my shares for the price I feel they&#39;re truly worth when it comes time to sell. I believe most investors feel the same way.,2022-01-09T19:59:15Z

$TNT  Sinopec operates in Canada too, big time.  Interesting with them being a part of the Gas / Oil pilot  and Tenet&#39;s Canadian expansion.

$TNT ‚Äî&gt; Consider shifting your timeline to the summer. Say July. 618 Event results are in. What revenue do you think Tenet would have for Q2? Canada would be operational and the USA division would be under development.  
 
Where do you see the stock at that point? Thats in 6 months. TSX, Hong Kong and Nasdaq would all be done. Are we not at all-time highs by then?.,2022-01-09T17:42:09Z

$TNT Someone made this comment and very valid. Yes the SEC has been a pain in the arse, but if it was a ‚Äúscam‚Äù or had major issues wouldn‚Äôt SEC have shut them down by now and moved on?

As Axl Rose once sang, ‚Äúall you need is paytience, yeaaah yeaaaaaah‚Äù,2022-01-08T22:29:25Z
$TNT It‚Äôs crazy that retail investors are being mislead, literally scared out of their investment as some bad actors are crying the sky is falling or this is a scam - IT&#39;S NOT!!!!  

DD clearly helps build confidence.  I&#39;m no pro investor, actually far from it
but when a company is already
profitable &amp; are experiencing
exponential growth &amp; affiliating with
massive entities such as: Chinese
Government (Financial centres),
PetroChina, Sinopec, COFCO,
corporate.jd.com/home, BJM, Ping An,
Ehi, Gruppo Coin, ShopEx, UnionPay/
Rongbang, XGL, Xiamen Guangzhui Ltd.
BDC, Dajinpengli, Bianlifeng, Xingcheng
Special Steel Works, YouCKU, &amp; more then this clearly proves company legitimacy.

Tenet is hitting their revenue projections &amp; will continue to revise  revenues upward as they expand inChina, North America, &amp; beyond! Recognize this isn&#39;t a one trick pony, they now have 5 clear revenue verticals that will generate billions in the coming years.

If you choose to invest in Tenet or not, GLTA!,2022-01-08T20:53:59Z
$TNT If you want something crazy to consider over the weekend, consider that the last time Tenet traded at this price was August.  Then consider where Tenet was business-wise at that time.  Then consider that Tenet was considered undervalued at the time. Then consider the pillars (petrol, insurance, clean tech), partnerships (Ping an, YouCKU, UnionPay, PetroChina) and business execution (revised guidance, singles day, Red Bull expansion, petro pilot) that have been announced since then.  Then have a beer.,2022-01-08T20:07:40Z
$TNT why are you guys panicking? The sp has only dropped 55% in a few months, got delisted from the nasdaq we re rocking and rolling. No need to make noiseü§°ü§°,2022-01-08T20:01:27Z
$TNT NASDAQ is just NASDAQ y‚Äôall. Company progress is what you invest in. They‚Äôre growing more than 200% 2021 and another 200% in 2023. And that‚Äôs still conservative with all the deals they made last few months. We‚Äôre not even talking about North America, South America and Europe just yet,2022-01-08T19:08:17Z
$TNT I never post on here at all but stop worrying about the Nasdaq and just trust the company which is making huge strides ,it&#39;s going to happen just chill and block out the noise,2022-01-08T18:45:42Z
$TNT Honestly, there is way to much focus on the SEC and not enough on company fundamentals.  The company is executing as can be seen by the many recent news releases, those clearly spreading FUD are promptly blocked which makes for light reading.  Spare me any cool-aid comments, I invest my $ in companies making real progress, generating real revenue, with a real growth strategy and Tenet is one such company.  We up-list when it happens, and for those new, do your own DD! GLTA üß®,2022-01-08T16:30:12Z

$TNT It seems logical to me that if I were an investor in Tenet and happened to own/operate a Canadian SME, I would sign up for Cubeler.

Vice versa

If I were a Canadian SME owner/operater who ended up using Cubeler, I would at least consider investing in Tenet.,2022-01-08T15:10:25Z
$TNT Are there any Canadian Small Business owners who have signed on to Cubeler and can speak on it here? Maybe give us some screenshots of the interior of the site? I considered signing up but I&#39;m not a Canadian Small Business owner, so I would simply be a lookie loo wasting their data and time.,2022-01-08T15:05:22Z
