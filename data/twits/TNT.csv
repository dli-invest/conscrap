$TNT I called the SEC office in the last several days and last week, left them 4 or 5 messages for certain inquiries (some other stuff and this TNT hold up), and was told on their voice messages that they&#39;ll return  my call promptly.  Still no call back for more than a week. The SEC are a bunch of useless bitches.  They sit on their asses getting paid through our tax money and can&#39;t seem to function right.  I don&#39;t blame JJ and management for dealing with this useless agency.  TNT is doing an excellent job of executing on the business side, but they have to deal with these incompetent SEC idiots that had track records of letting con men on wall street crashed the market such as in 2008 and 2011.  That&#39;s why now the DOJ are stepping in to put on the big boy pants to do the work that these  SEC idiots are suppose to do.  Useless and should be dissolve from the U.S. government because they&#39;re not protecting the market at all.,2021-12-22T22:59:11Z
$TNT Using a 2021 revenue estimate of US$87 million (which is conservative knowing we have already met or beat guidance), at market close today it is trading at only 5.73 times EV/sales.  That multiple is significantly undervalued compared to its peers at an average 12.7x.  If the company‚Äôs CN$345 million (US$274 million) 2022 guidance is achieved, stock price could move to $45.00 per share next year.     Know what you own üí™‚è≥üìà,2021-12-22T22:08:52Z
Just completed a survey which prompted me to revisit why I believe $TNT is going to make us rich! Easy money can‚Äôt wait to see that guidance revised a few more times in 2022 üöÄ üñ® üí∞ üê∏,2021-12-22T20:41:46Z

$TNT SEC is a bunch of B!tch3s.  The amendment to the 40-F which addressed the headquarter change, name change and updating of a few risk disclosures was filed in 12/7.  Is the SEC seriously going to sit on this for 30 more days.   That&#39;s what it looks like.  Is there a time limit for how long they can sit on an amendment?   I keep telling myself patience grasshopper.  Patience.,2021-12-22T15:38:10Z

$TNT The Santa Clause rally takes place on the last 5 trading days of the year and first 2 trading days of the new year. It&#39;s what has helped the market yesterday.

The approximate line in the sand to get over PKK&#39;s current downtrend is $9 CAD as johnny_Geezy posted below.

We all want NASDAQ to happen sooner rather than later but the price can break out of the trend with or without it.,2021-12-22T14:53:13Z

$TNT Hey y&#39;all, been following Jim Cramer having COVID on Twitter. He got it just 3 days ago and has already beat it. 3 days. That&#39;s amazing. People who are unvaccinated have this for several weeks, then can potentially wind up in the hospital or in the grave.
