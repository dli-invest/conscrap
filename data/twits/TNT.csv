$TNT pete where you at?  You think share price will be $6 when its pulling in over 300mm in 2022?  Revenue doesn&#39;t lie, financial statements is all you need to look at , that&#39;s why you will never see a fintech company with p/e at 2x.,2021-12-01T03:35:37Z
$TNT I have a shit ton of shares mostly from the 4s, but a lot in the 8s, 9s, and 11s.  Am I worried?  Not at all 

Revenue and net income tells me everything I need to know  for the next few years. 

Reminder, every single Cuebler owner took shares.  If anybody knows then its these guys.,2021-12-01T03:06:40Z
$TNT Do you guys remember when JJ brought up stock buy backs on the Q3. He made an inside joke about it. Not interested, not worried and super bullish. What we have here is another gift for anyone with dry powder.,2021-12-01T02:59:20Z

$TNT Eight Capital Partners was buying virtually all day accumulating 24,000+ shares. Iâ€™d say thatâ€™s a great sign for a bottom here. Furthermore, we now know that the questions the SEC had around why the name change and why the move to Toronto are truly minor. If they had other concerns, those would have been brought up. We also know that Q4 financials will include revenue from some of the other pillars and Singles Day activity. This is a ground floor opportunity here.,2021-12-01T02:49:45Z
$TNT Hey fellas I&#39;m curious about something.

 In the U.S. our tax system rewards investors who hold long term by giving us very favorable capital gains rates if the hold is one year or longer. It also discourages selling at a loss, then buying back within 30 days of the sale (wash sale rule). This is for standard brokerage accounts of course. We also have tax sheltered retirement accounts which allow us to trade freely within without tax consequences. But I&#39;m curious if Canada has a similar tax regime in regard to standard brokerage account trading? What are your capital gains taxes like?,2021-12-01T02:46:32Z

$TNT This whole market sucks. Thinking 3 weeks â€¦ unexpected comments by the Fed ..Covid. In three weeks weâ€™ll find out the new strain of Covid is mild and the economy is strong ..IMO
Buy some ETH. It will make you feel better:-)

$TNT Iâ€™m sure many of you will be relieved to know Iâ€™ll be going on vacation for a bit. When Iâ€™m back, Iâ€™ll buy in lower. You donâ€™t need to put up with my retired chat, and perspective on the general market. You can search that for yourself when youâ€™re left wondering. Like I said I still have a small position, just not overexposed on it anymore. Sold in the green at different levels. Bye  for one.,2021-11-30T22:36:09Z
$TNT Us bears don&#39;t even want @Walidh  on our team, never trust someone who flips his position within 12hours and sells the bottom.,2021-11-30T22:25:17Z
