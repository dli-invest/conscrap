$TNT Do we really want to be up-listed into this freaked out market? Just saying.,2021-11-27T02:48:55Z
$TNT Here is what I received from Barry. And it is in line with what JJ said during the earnings call. By end of year listed on Nasdaq. 
“The SEC came back with a few questions on Wednesday, minor ones. We plan on submitting the answers on Monday and we expect to see a quick turn around from their side. After that, a request for an accelerated relisting on Nasdaq.”,2021-11-27T02:13:55Z

Based on estimates for the next 5 years, $TNT will show a quite strong growth in EPS: 19.87% on average per year. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/TNT/fundamental-analysis?key=690bddba-1b63-4685-a193-eb53e75e1267&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=TNT&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2021-11-27T02:03:00Z
$TNT I&#39;m assuming because Cathy assistant lady and Barry both used the adjective &quot;trivial&quot; that this was also a descriptive used by whomever they received this information from.,2021-11-27T01:52:18Z
$TNT Barry should have to put up his hand if he wants to take a piss, email or talk about Tenet,2021-11-27T01:27:08Z
$TNT Weak people here. People like @GreenLIFE are the ones who constantly pump and give fake dates to everyone.. read his posts here and on Yahoo.......just ignore the noise... Everyone just relax... and all will be well. Focus on Fundamentals ! Nasdaq will happen...,2021-11-27T00:52:59Z
$TNT The time for panic was a month or two ago people. Relax. Stay in the damn car.,2021-11-27T00:43:52Z
$TNT Hate to say I told you so but I told you so, the perma bull hype artists once again were spamming their fake deadlines saying everything will be done by the 27th. Someday when you get out of highschool and go into the real world youll realize things never go in a straight line. You have been wrong at least 2 times trying to predict the relist. Word of advice stop trying to predict deadlines when dealing with the government. 
  I am BEARISH AF on this stock until they figure their shit out, Nasdaq and ER(not even letting investors know when its being released) have proven this company to be an absolute shit show. You bulls better pray Q4 is good or yall are fucked. Enjoy the weekend!,2021-11-27T00:19:47Z
$TNT Google&#39;d &quot;How long does it take for SEC to approve listing&quot; a long long time ago and saw this answer on Quora. Read it carefully so you will understand it.

$TNT I posted this awhile back but some said &quot;but this doesn&#39;t apply to us&quot;

Yes, it applies to us.,2021-11-26T23:17:03Z

The technical rating of $TNT is bad and it also does not present a quality setup at the moment. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/analyzer/stock/TNT?key=690bddba-1b63-4685-a193-eb53e75e1267&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=TA&amp;utm_content=TNT&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2021-11-26T22:08:00Z
$TNT I just care about how long after they turn around does the SEC have to respond. Better not be another 30 days.,2021-11-26T22:06:18Z
$TNT Wether the SEC commented or not or how trivial the nature of the questions were or how fast they will turnaround back to SEC… All of that is trivial and has zero impact on business growth and the continued development in partnerships and verticals.,2021-11-26T21:52:32Z

$TNT ** UPDATE ** 
I contacted Barry this afternoon and received this prompt email: 
 
Hi xxxx, 
 
We received additional &quot;comments&quot; from the SEC on Wednesday afternoon prior to the long weekend which we need to respond to and expect to have answers to them on Monday next week. We are expecting a quick turn around because the questions are trivial. 
 
Regards, Barry.,2021-11-26T20:34:52Z

$TNT  Will be nice once we uplist to the Hong Kong exchange as well, will make it more difficult and less predictable to short this stock.  Also adding a whole new realm of investors that are right in the regon where the China arm operates giving first hand knowledge of the massive deals Tenet has already landed there.,2021-11-26T18:03:11Z
$TNT Compare the market to PKK. It’s holding its own today and has its own story regardless of the market. Would be nice to get listed on Nasdaq at the same time the market as while rises again.,2021-11-26T17:53:36Z
