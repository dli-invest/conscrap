The technical rating of $TNT is bad and it also does not present a quality setup at the moment. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/TNT/technical-analysis?key=690bddba-1b63-4685-a193-eb53e75e1267&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=TA&amp;utm_content=TNT&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-01-16T23:13:00Z

$TNT To anyone who is unhappy with SF and their new paid service... its not enough that u decide not to pay the $35. LEAVE THEIR SERVER. They could be profiting from the number of &quot;members&quot; that they have in their discord. Despite 99% of those people being free users.

Not like there is anything left to gain by being in it,2022-01-16T21:26:14Z
$TNT Just joined Stockfam discord group its so good in there!!! I asked what are peoples thoughts on the current Nasdaq relisting delay and got ban! I should have posted an article on China&#39;s GDP and how it could connect to Tenet. Highly recommend the paid pumper discord!,2022-01-16T20:44:25Z
$TNT StockFam blocked any dissenting Posts, and so didn&#39;t bring a balanced viewpoint.   Good stock analysis involves BOTH  TA &amp; FA.  I never saw them post any Technical Chart Analysis (TA).  Now that TNT is well established, we all have access to future FA debates, by savvy members here. 
 
When the SEC issue began, they advised this would be over &quot;in a few days&quot;,  encouraged no one to Sell,  booted those that recommended selling ...  is that good advice? 
  
Their last video cc with JJ tanked the stock .. so how valuable are they?  
  
As well,  none of their other picks are all that fabulous. FOBI, for example is definitely a pump&#39;nDump, with a documented crooked Pres.  (ref:  BC Supreme court)  
  
They are just making a cash grab to fund a small block purchase, since TNT has clearly made bottom.  Cashing in now is poor taste.  imo,2022-01-16T20:08:08Z
$TNT I&#39;m going to keep my goofy posting on StockTwits but anytime I have something informative about Tenet I&#39;ll simultaneously post on the new Discord. I want to see it successful.,2022-01-16T18:39:15Z

$TNT I‚Äôm on several other stock boards for my other investments, very well run ones..free. The monitors give their own time and have no affiliation with the company.

From what I‚Äôve seen the best posters are right here in this case. 
Appreciate you guys‚ù£Ô∏èüß®,2022-01-16T16:58:02Z
$TNT Everyone hating on Stockfam I don‚Äôt get that. SF gave us platform where we could talk about great stocks like Tenet and share DD without any BS that‚Äôs not possible on stocktwits or yahoo where a lot of the posts are based on emotion and unfactual news or bears spreading FUD. It‚Äôs a clean board without all the BS personally I love that. Learned a lot from SF in a year I would happy pay $320 for all of the things I learned. Could pay $1000+ for me it was the perfect learning school. Learning is worth way more as a few hundreds will help you in the future. At the beginning I also made some posts that were unnecessary or without DD and got deleted first got annoyed but they explained me and started to learn how to become a better investor and doing as much DD I really respect that some tough love to improve yourself.
I will stay with SF and happily pay $32 a month worth every dollar.,2022-01-16T09:10:57Z
$TNT i‚Äôve had enough of the Stockfam cult - where is the new discord everyone is joining? We need an open forum with limited/no censorship,2022-01-16T03:58:04Z
$TNT  Back on Jan 1st I did a year recap of deals etc. in 2021.  I had my wires crossed on one point (the deal with BJM)  and I apologize.  
 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   BJM is  NOT a Cofco subsidiary.  
 
 BJM (and other distributors that Tenet is affiliated with) are the &quot;arms&quot; of Cofco in China however with exclusive distribution rights.  BJM has about 260 000 retail clients.  
 
BJM is a major distributor of a variety of popular products from China Oil and Foodstuffs Corp. (COFCO), for which it has exclusive distribution rights to approximately 200,000 Petro-China convenience stores and with on-line retail giant JD.com. COFCO is a state-owned food processing company. It is China‚Äôs largest food processor, manufacturer and commodities trader. With operations in Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, it‚Äôs one of the largest agribusiness groups in all of Asia.,2022-01-15T23:39:47Z

I am not paying the $35 monthly fee for StockFam at this juncture. But, this one is free, and I think a lot of the valued posters that were on StockFam discord will be on this one.,2022-01-15T22:48:30Z

$TNT Money makes the world go &#39;round. I&#39;m not hating on anyone trying to make it. It just set me off when I came to realize why the StockFam crew even brought up random false internet troll rumors to a CEO. Rumors I personally have never even read on a message board. It makes sense now that StockFam is going to subscriber.

Has anyone else read on any other boards about the false rumors they brought up in the interview?,2022-01-15T20:21:09Z
$TNT JJ Recently records an interview where he blasts &quot;internet trolls&quot; and encourages people to not base their decisions off what people read from internet boards. Which is good advice. But then Florton Artias Consulting comes with a paid subscription service days later...

...

Think about it folks. JJ received the &quot;internet troll&quot; rumors FROM StockFam. They basically used JJ into inherently promote their service! ü§¶ü§¨

$TNT nice volume in the past week.... looking for a breakout in the next week or so..... especially if SEC approval coming (before Jan 24th if based on their avg response timing). 
 
Any thoughts on Stockfam going premium?.  I&#39;ve gone on there a few times, but didn&#39;t really find it useful as i personally don&#39;t like any of their stock picks (aside from Tenet, which i discovered in 2020 from a friend since i&#39;m in the same field at work).  They would have done better if they went premium on a bullish market when everything is up instead of down. :)  .  i&#39;ll stick to ST for my info/fud/opinions etc.,2022-01-15T17:54:49Z

Was looking at the insider transaction again. 
 
 Maybe purchased the shares in wife&#39;s account and then transferred to his business,  then Sedar posted it the next day.  
 
(He is a certified public accountant with degrees in economics and finance so he knows what he is doing to be sure) 
 
Says TX date Jan 13th and the filed date Jan 14th at 6:29 am (before the bell)   Also,  If she already owned the shares why would the price be exactly what it is currently and say open market buy?   
 
Any thoughts?

https://www.accaglobal.com/in/en/student/exam-support-resources/professional-exams-study-resources/p7/technical-articles/auditing-disclosures.html,2022-01-15T07:57:48Z
$TNT   @ CSP79 / Taotrader   I&#39;m surprised you haven&#39;t noticed those disclosures before in other stock.  Auditors put those in, it&#39;s normal. 
 
The fact that Tenet doesn&#39;t carry debt and has net income that is growing nullifies &quot;burn rate&quot;.   
 
  Now if we see debt in a company, and negative earnings(net loss) that keeps growing it could be a red flag depending if it&#39;s temporary to fuel growth or habitual. I&#39;m no expert but seeing those disclosures is normal.,2022-01-15T07:02:46Z
$TNT I have had a position of varying size in this company since Sep 2021.  I finally went through 40F.  I was alarmed when I came across this statement - &quot;Moreover, our auditors, Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton LLP (&quot;GT Canada&quot;), have stated that there is significant doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments to contractors, service providers and merchants will depend on our future financial performance, which will be affected by a range of economic, competitive, regulatory, legislative and business factors, many of which are outside of our control.&quot;  Any educated comments from the gallery on this?,2022-01-15T04:10:29Z
$TNT With respect to the SEC processing time, below is a list of known timeline:
TNT submits 40-F   2021-10-27
SEC first comments  2021-11-24 (+28 days)
TNT submits 40-F amendment 2021-12-7 (+13 days)
SEC second comments 2021-12-28 (+21 days)
TNT submits response letter 2022-1-12 (+15 days)
According to this 2013 statistics https://www.wilmerhale.com/en/insights/blogs/the-road-to-ipo-legal-and-regulatory-insights-into-going-public/how-quickly-does-the-sec-staff-review-a-form-s-1-updated-data , and considering some delays caused by the holiday season and SEC new guideline that came out on 12-22-2021, I think we are perfectly within the normal SEC processing time.

As JJ stated in the interview, so far there is no indication that SEC won&#39;t make the registration effective. And personally I think we are getting very close. According to the 2013 link, we can expect SEC feedback on the response letter in a median of 12 days starting from 2022-1-12.,2022-01-14T21:40:38Z
