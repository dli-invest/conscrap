$TNT I know it goes down on absolutely no volume, but the same principle works the other way as well.  It would be nice to see even a minuscule amount of buying to push this up and hold a gain once in awhile.,2021-12-16T22:03:36Z
$FOBIF $TNT Ok so I‚Äôm sticking my neck out and letting you guys know that in the last 15mins I took 29k from Tenet and moved into  Fobi for a one day play. Hopefully this doesn‚Äôt end up being the day when TNT shoots up on SEC approval and Fobis AGM ends up being a snoozer. Just sharing that‚Äôs all. (If TNT gets approval can I do a collection plate?) üòÇ üò≠,2021-12-16T21:28:53Z

$TNT  Sure hope something good happens fast - 30th is creeping up to tempt even the true believers with tax loss harvesting. Been in for two years and not selling, and in fact wish I could buy more, so no jibber jabber ;),2021-12-16T21:19:23Z

$TNT Will we get a couples day (Dec 12) performance update by Monday? Here‚Äôs hoping. With each new even Tenet adds the SEC waiting thing becomes less impactful and what the company produces with their innovative HUB takes more of the spotlight I believe.,2021-12-16T14:04:58Z

$TNT have to laugh at how sure pseudo macro analysts were about a monster rate hike to nuke the markets. 

Expect more policy backtracking btw from current admin and add that to your own forecasts cuz it&#39;s relevant. They did everything this year to scare and beat up growth and next year expect reversal.,2021-12-15T23:44:13Z

$TRIT Bought some more. So getting delisted is bad and having no audited financials is bad huh? Ok lets compare to Tenet fintech:
 $TNT vs $TRIT
Listing: delisted | listed(for now at least)
Category: Financing Fintech | Financing Fintech
Marketcap: ~$500 million | ~$288 million
Earnings: ~$0 | $27 million (2020)
Revenue: ~$66 million | ~$39 million (2020, before IB acquisition)
Audited?: Not trying | Not yet
Doing business in: China | Singapore
cash-debt: ~$50million | ~$130 million last self reported

So at these prices, 3 possibilities: 
1. we go go to OTC, no more silence period rules and no audit requirements. If new unaudited financials are at least as good as old ones then we go up. 
2. Trit releases financials and we go up hard.
3. OTC and terrible financials or no financials, then its not pretty but we still have legal options.
