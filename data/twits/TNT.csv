$TNT For tomorrow and the next couple of days‚Ä¶the latest release of Q2 earnings, the stock was mostly flat for a couple of days then BAM up it went. So don‚Äôt be surprised if it takes a couple of days for the news to run the block.,2021-11-15T02:11:09Z

$TNT I&#39;m brushing up on my Canadian knowledge. Figure if I&#39;m going to hold a Canadian company with a very significant portion of my net worth I should at least know some Canadian trivia:

Did you know:

-Canada has 20% of the worlds fresh water.

-The oldest rocks on Earth can be found in the Canadian shield; they are about 4.28 billion years old. 

-Canada has the longest highway in the world, the Trans-Canada Highway is 4,860 miles long. 

-Canada is the world leader in mining uranium. 

-The smallest town in Canada is Tilt Cove in Newfoundland, population 4. 

-Bono once said, &quot;I believe the world needs more Canada.&quot; 

Now, for the U.S. crew, here&#39;s some trivia questions. Hold off answering at first Canadians, see if they can get these right.

What is a &quot;kerfuffle&quot;?

How about a &quot;Chesterfield&quot;?

What do Canadians call their tennis shoes?

What do Canadians call paper napkins?

How about cereal?

Don&#39;t Google it! If you don&#39;t know it let someone else answer, or try to take a guess!,2021-11-14T22:40:16Z
$TNT futures looking super green right now .... good timing for some solid Q3 numbers tomorrow.,2021-11-14T21:36:13Z
$TNT  Tax purposes, French translation for paperwork / news reports and to be more geographically centralized in Canada&#39;s economic and tech basket are certainly good reasons for the move to Toronto from Quebec.  

&gt;&gt;  And now this  ( Not sure if JJ speaks French, but if not does he really have any extra time to learn it
?  lol)

&gt;&gt;  The Quebec government will work to identify leaders of companies based in the province who don&#39;t speak French and try to persuade them to learn the language, Premier Francois Legault said Friday.

His comments came in reaction to the recent admissions by the CEOs of two major Montreal-based companies that they speak little French. Legault said corporate leaders in Quebec should be able to speak the language of the majority in the province, adding that his government was ‚Äúlooking at different approaches to ensure this.&#39;&#39;,2021-11-14T19:12:41Z
$TNT excellent YT analysis on TNT

https://youtu.be/qZZ_ZFNhQkM,2021-11-14T14:55:59Z
$TNT been researching ARKX as a possible small position and learnt it took 79 days for the SEC to approve once filed. Not a big point, I&#39;m bullish on TNT and have a small position but we&#39;re not quite at this deadline and that was for a fund which passed without any hiccups. I&#39;m very happy remaining patient on this and palantir (for different reasons),2021-11-14T05:08:06Z
$TNT have the normal rational investors at least realize who the cheerleader clowns are by now? Careful who you listen to and group think is an awful thing here.,2021-11-14T03:52:42Z
$TNT there were rumours earlier in the year about giving out a small dividend just to show how PKK can pull money out of China for the investors.   Even a $2mm dividend as a test means each person gets about 2cents per share.... I mean i don&#39;t mind that as a xmas bonus if they just want to test it out....i&#39;m all for it.,2021-11-13T21:21:37Z
$TNT $30-$36 M for Q3 $40-$45 for Q4,2021-11-13T20:01:20Z
$TNT from guidance we still have approximately 4 million net profits (H2) coming so q3 should be atleast 1-2 million and with the oil and gas vertical making up for the 618 event and organic growth (red bull), we should definitely see Q3 revenues 32-36 million minimum, anything less I believe would be a disappointment,2021-11-13T19:13:19Z
$TNT either this quarter or for sure next quarter we will start seeing substantial profits being generated. That&#39;s one the main reasons this is my biggest holding. Not only does it have massive growth but also profitability which many of the tech stocks trading on the nasdaq with market caps in the billions can&#39;t say,2021-11-13T15:59:14Z
$TNT i&#39;m guessing conservatively b/w $36-$38 mm ..... Positive net income.  Should be in the 40s for Q4.,2021-11-13T01:47:15Z
$TNT  Solid day today :)  

   Keep in mind for Q3 Monday the guidance for Q3 and Q4 combined is approx. 64 mill with an upside on the positive earnings end. 

 My guess would be a little lower this one then a little higher Q4 to make up that 64 number. They are in the middle of expansion and hiring etc. too so expenses up a bit higher Q3 and Q4 as well.

  Next years guidance is WAY higher so that , imo , is where we will begin to see the massive increases.,2021-11-13T01:35:38Z
$TNT Monday Q3 numbers will be coming out.  If we make 30 Million plus we are golden.  I am shooting for around 60 Million as a top end.  Anything above 30M is amazing!,2021-11-12T22:38:55Z

$TNT 

What‚Äôs your average after listing, delisting, OTC lockout etc‚Ä¶.

I‚Äôve averaged both up and down - 

As of now average $8.33

Unable to go lower since none of the three trading platforms I‚Äôm using will allow purchases of Tenet - liquidation only.

This includes the dickheads at Tradestation who said ‚ÄúOperations can stop any stock trade, and they don‚Äôt need a reason and don‚Äôt have to explain the decision‚Äù.,2021-11-12T21:11:26Z
