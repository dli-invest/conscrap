$TNT  Could very well be this week, but could also very well slip a bit longer into next week. Nasdaq should be fairly quick though beyond this.  I would bet it will be all clear and up and running well before Q2 release. 

   Keep in mind the SEC doesn&#39;t do things lightning quick, in fact, this IS fast for the SEC to be sure.,2021-11-04T05:04:00Z
$TNT what‚Äôs a good number to call SEC? These people take their sweet little time a little longer than I like,2021-11-04T03:28:22Z

$TNT &quot;Management expects needing to fill between 60 to 70 
positions over a two-to-three-month period to launch and manage the Issuer‚Äôs Canadian operations. A number of key positions were filled during the period, including Director of Recruitment, VP Business Development and HR Director. Most of the new employees are expected to be based in Montreal, but management actively began looking for office space in the city of Toronto during the period to allow the Issuer to have access to a broader talent pool to fill some of the positions still open.&quot;,2021-11-04T02:36:33Z

$TNT While the process to get the Issuer‚Äôs common shares re-instated for trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange was ongoing, the Issuer began the process to have its common shares listed on a senior stock exchange in Canada. #TSEbaby #LFG,2021-11-04T01:40:36Z

$TNT-  ‚ÄúTNT believes that if it‚Äôs able to replicate the success it had at 618 back in June during Singles‚Äô Day 2021, the event could account for anywhere between 25% to 30% of its revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021.‚Äù,2021-11-04T01:21:59Z
$TNT Just to provide some short and sweet due diligence for the NEW INVESTORS.

Who is JJ?
-He is the CEO. He used to also play Football (CFL). So not only can he kick your ass, he can also make you rich

What does Tenet Fintech (formerly Peak Fintech  formerly Peak Positionings Technology) do?
-The company provides a Hub where it connects Financial Institutions with SME&#39;s (Small to medium sized Enterprises). The AI de-risks it for the Financial Institutions by connecting the SME&#39;s to the exact needs of the company.,2021-11-04T01:20:47Z

$TNT ATTENTION NEW INVESTORS:

Welcome to Stocktwits where we have identified two retarded posters today:
1) @StockGuruJr - He is a permanent poster here. He has identified himself as a shorter and is currently bashing the stock with ZERO due diligence to back it up

2) @petethesneak - This one is a special case. Full of hypotheticals that he pulls out of his ass. He has provided ZERO due diligence as well. His mom should have swallowed him and has a definite short position. He takes it from behind and asks that you pull his hair so he can make eye contact with you.

Mute these cocksuckers. You will be happier.,2021-11-04T00:00:54Z
$TNT 6 weeks and counting so far waiting for the Nasdaq relist, meanwhile perma pulls are predicting $25 price points by year end. Cant wait for Nasdaq relist so the big boys can walk this scam back down to pennies,2021-11-03T22:52:23Z
$TNT Barry told me they had checked out 9 offices last week. Downtown near the financial centre. You already knew that, though. Towers in every major city around the world. Book it.,2021-11-03T20:44:18Z
$TNT y‚Äôall will learn the hard way. Idiots keep saying this week and that week. Nothing has happened other than the SP falling,2021-11-03T20:30:55Z
$TNT my shares in TD Ameritrade is back! SEC need to up their game, they allow company like Nikola to trade while taking their own sweet time on legit company like TNT, what a way to protect the retail investor. I need them to faster uplist it so my brokage can release margin to me to do options for cashflow!,2021-11-03T20:16:26Z
$TNT For those worried about the SEC and whether we may or may not trade on the NASDAQ, I promise you that I have ZERO doubt Tenet will trade on the NASDAQ. The only question is when. I would wager a big bet with any naysayer on this. I&#39;ve proven myself to be a skeptic before on other issues. But this one I have no doubt about. The SEC is a law enforcement agency. If you know our company is following all rules, regulations and laws, what are you worried about?,2021-11-03T18:55:46Z
$TNT Going on 6 Weeks since delisting‚Ä¶.When will JJ and team be held accountable?  Stop offering excuses for them!  This stock will go nowhere until it gets re-listed!,2021-11-03T18:55:19Z

$TNT If you still want buy you better do it before the uplisting. Peak is stacking up pr&#39;s because of this delay. think about 5-10 PR&#39;s or more they will be released 
 
 and the uplisting for Peak  will also give a spike,2021-11-03T13:36:36Z
