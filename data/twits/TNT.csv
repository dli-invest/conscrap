$TNT @stockguru: I think u are confusing investing with trading. As a long term bull, Peak‚Äôs business model n future prospects are more important than short term price fluctuations. U would have sold out of Amazon 20 years ago with your investment philosophy.,2021-09-24T20:49:20Z

$TNT Peak Fintech (OTC:PKKFF) blew away our revenue estimate of $25 million coming in with a $30.6 million quarter, which was growth of 322% compared with last year. Taking out the bank interest generation and ASCS loan servicing fees, platform and supply chain related revenues were $29.8 million compared to $6.2 million a year ago, or growth of 382%. Most of the revenues in the quarter were from low margin supply chain customers but the future growth is expected to come from higher margin services that will contribute gross margins between 50-60%. This quarter $2.0 million in revenues came from these higher margin services. The $2.0 million is the sum of the bank (ASFC) plus ASCS plus services generated from platform customers of $1.2 million. Although it was not evidenced this quarter, gross margin is expected to improve by the shift to using Gold River rather than outside suppliers, which could cut costs 30% for Peak.,2021-09-24T13:25:24Z
