$TNT tell you what guys by Q2 you&#39;ll look at this late Q4 mkt turbulence and sell offs as a big gift. Just like Dec &#39;18 was. I sure have taken advantage in being strongly positioned in things and I hope you all have as well because I predict quite a run coming up on the right assets. 

Lots of multibag gains just like post Dec &#39;18 üí™üí™,2021-12-19T16:09:33Z

$TNT $SOFI  $GENI  $NU  The Santa rally is gone. Brandon will be making or should I say read someone‚Äôs speech to shut it down because of the new variant of COVID. Some colleges are talking about remote classes again. Last year was a dark winter, this year is a death winter. It‚Äôs time to get over it and move on.,2021-12-19T13:00:51Z
$TNT what a year for Tenet. The biggest risk factor to company coming into the year was not owning the intellectual property for the software platform (Cubeler). This could have allowed for a big player to see the success and come in and out bid Tenet for the rights or even buy Cubeler out from under them. 

But with the acquisition, that was put to rest.  This also allows them to further de risk by expanding into multiple geographical regions. In my opinion, future is bright. Look forward to see what 2022 has to offer.,2021-12-19T06:00:01Z

$TNT  great read on how Anson Funds shorted small cap stocks while doing PP&#39;s , which is the same thing that PKK went through.  Paid bashers and more.....

JJ built this company from scratch and has shown the ability to do that in frikin China. Takes balls of titanium to build up a business in China.  I see continuing execution identifying and moving rapidly into key sectors. Amazing growth and earnings positive on top of that.

  The SEC issued new guidance in regards to VIE shell companies and strait up Chinese companies for transparency issues with financials etc.  

  There wasn&#39;t anything defined for non VIE and non Chinese companies with operations there that are audited domestically.  Nothing at all about  a form 40 needing to include all these disclaimers.

 We applied for Nasdaq using the way that allows for accepted countries like Canada based on those domestic audits.  They accepted us so we uplisted.  The SEC suddenly wants all these disclaimers in there so we are complying with it.

  Eyes on 2022 +  folks,   don&#39;t forget revenue / positive earnings and execution drives stock price.  ;P,2021-12-18T13:15:55Z

$TNT The shorts covered as soon as they saw that amended 40-F had been posted on the SEC website. Then once they saw that it would take another few weeks to actually be listed, they trickled back into their short position. Is this hard to see? If you don&#39;t have the patience to ride the difficult waves, sell to the smart money that will. ü§∑,2021-12-17T15:14:22Z
