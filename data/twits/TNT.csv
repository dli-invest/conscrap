With all the new iPhones that are selling preorderes. Peak did a pilot project last year and was very successful. I wonder how successful this will be for Peak this year?

$TNT (doorknob on Discord): my notes indicate a listing on the Hong Kong exchange about 4-6 weeks after the Nasdaq uplisting. Maybe a month away from that. Yet another catalyst! 

‚ÄúChina has way more purchasing power and both that and the economy is still moving faster than anyone in the world. On top of this China has removed restriction on child birth. I know we are on the NASDAQ and wait till they list on Hong Kong. When all these Chinese sme&#39;s expand at a fast rate ... the news of this CO. will take over any American influence on stock price . They know in China what something is worth when they see everyone using it. They are driving Apple etc.  They will drive TNT..TNT will get its real value and these two bit brokers over here will have lost control.‚Äù,2021-09-20T01:04:58Z

The technical rating of $TNT is bad and it also does not present a quality setup at the moment. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/analyzer/stock/TNT?key=690bddba-1b63-4685-a193-eb53e75e1267&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=TA&amp;utm_content=TNT&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2021-09-18T12:42:00Z

$TNT investors are very lucky to be here at the bottom. Couple years and you can retire on this 

$UPST looks amazing, too - TNT will be here in a couple years. Go check out their revenues üëç‚¨ÜÔ∏è,2021-09-18T02:54:35Z
$TNT if this ever passes my pubm share price ill convert all those pubm shares to tnt . pubm. Sitting around 27.00,2021-09-18T01:23:51Z
$TNT with watchers and investors growing here at a robust clip, here is a Discord group (StockFam) that has done extensive due diligence and has ongoing analysis about Peak/TNT. Once you are in, scroll down to Peak Fintech (general). It‚Äôs free, and all I want out of it is for investors here to be educated about the fundamentals and unique (rare) opportunity that this is. Think UPST, but B2B even stickier.
