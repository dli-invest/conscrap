$TNT Well hopefully the capitulation is close to being over. Kicking myself for buying so many shares in the 6s last month and not saving a bit more powder for this. hindsight sure is 20/20.,2022-01-07T01:56:06Z

$TNT Look at all of you. You guys are literally target #1 of the shorters, they short the stock during periods of uncertainty to get dumb money retail thinking something is wrong with the company and then you eventually lose it and sell them your shares for cheap. They play on your emotions as sheep and it works. The amount of constant whining and crying on these forums is honestly pathetic. Oh no you didn‚Äôt make 300% returns in a month? Oh no you‚Äôve been invested for 3 months and you‚Äôre down on your investment? Aw, how awful, let‚Äôs sit on Stocktwits every day, shake our rattles and  cry that the CEO doesn‚Äôt tuck us in at night like mommy does. No,  IR isn‚Äôt making the stock price go down, Nasdaq isn‚Äôt making it go down, not the law firms and not Grizzly , but dumb money retail that are easily manipulated into selling their shares.,2022-01-07T01:31:05Z

$TNT what Happens if stock gets below $4  by the time SEC approves the 40F. does TNT have to do another reverse split to be eligible for Nasdaq again?   Anyone have any insight?,2022-01-07T00:09:38Z
$TNT from Facebook. Well, the TNT shares are mainly held by the retailers and there&#39;s a reason why retailers are known as dumb money. They are easily affect from stupid folks and company that are spreading FUD. Smart money can&#39;t get in if TNT is not on a major exchange, it is what it is, got to wait it.,2022-01-06T23:23:26Z
$TNT I see the shitshow is continuing with this junk! I&#39;m sure Greenlife or Fast capital will pipe in saying $100 sp EOY LOL,2022-01-06T23:05:51Z
$TNT I wonder if the recent collapse in price will bring some humility to the people that kicked, blocked and deleted people for asking relevant questions on discord instead of having blind faith.,2022-01-06T22:55:46Z

$TNT Talked with Cathy Hume this afternoon, nobody seems to have a clue as to the hold up for #Nasdaq, mostly speculation on Geo-political tensions.   But No real direction.  One would think JJ &amp; Team would at least address investors considering this dive to SP is worse than Grizzly BS, and they at least came out with an update then.,2022-01-06T22:00:51Z
$TNT where is management?,2022-01-06T21:31:46Z

$TNT I‚Äôll stop shorting and start buying when it‚Äôs $5.. maybe even $4,2022-01-06T21:04:43Z
$TNT damn this is depressing to watch.  I was up more than 100% at ATH and now all gains disappeared. I am still long and understand the business is doing good but damn. (Btw first time posting on Stocktwits),2022-01-06T21:04:15Z
