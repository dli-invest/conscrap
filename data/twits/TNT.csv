$TNT JD.com reported a transaction volume of $55 billion during the shopping festival (source: Motley Fool). Incredible number. Looking forward to Tenet&#39;s numbers.,2021-11-11T23:10:01Z
$TNT Does anyone know where i can download short interest information for markets ??,2021-11-11T22:26:35Z
$TNT These margin requirements from Fidelity are no fun especially with the low daily volume traded, the risk profiles change dramatically.   Look forward to #Nasdaq daily volumes.,2021-11-11T21:53:14Z
$TNT @StockGuruJr kinda like you. üòù,2021-11-11T21:00:03Z

$TNT if we won‚Äôt get a fast approval and they review the document till the deadline we get automatically approved after the 27th.

We just need to be patient and maybe hope they will finish the review before this timeline. Don‚Äôt expect they finish earlier because they SEC is a slow government institution. These kinda institutions always take their time they don‚Äôt care about investors and the stock price,2021-11-11T20:30:03Z
During Q2, $TNT opened offices in both Guangzhou and Beijing. Oil and gas pilot project took place near the Port of Guangdong with some of the world‚Äôs biggest oil companies. China claims home to 7 of the top 10 biggest ports in world, one of which also happens to be in Beijing. A deal with BP, Sinopec, and/or Petro China would be worth #Billions,2021-11-11T20:15:43Z

$TNT staying to conviction and seeing the results in the future is not only satisfying, but how you attain financial freedom. 4 or 5 multibag winners that you were piled in puts you in the top 1% fast ~~ dont miss your spot if on fence this sector is explosive and we have a real item here held back only by a debunked short &amp; distort that didn&#39;t even hammer the stock price as they anticipated. 

The shorts will move along shortly or get incinerated as was the case on several of my recent positions. 

Likewise anybody here that also is in the crypto space you should expect a large winter surge and then a crypto winter --- so all of those profits(take them accordingly) will need to see good use and fintech is just starting to roar. 

Bears I have no time for you---- instablock on sight.,2021-11-11T18:53:13Z
$TNT The Insurance 100 2020 report ranking shows Ping An&#39;s brand value increased 20% year on year to USD60.6 billion. This has consolidated Ping An&#39;s leadership position as it has retained the top spot as the world&#39;s most valuable insurance brand for the fourth year in a row.

$TNT I appreciate y&#39;all putting me on to Yahoo Finance. I tried the app a year or two ago but didn&#39;t like it. They must have changed something about it, or maybe I&#39;ve changed. I&#39;m enjoying being able to look at PKK and PKKFF simultaneously, along with the few other stocks I have $CHPT $TPGY $DAN Neither E*Trade nor Fidelity let me look up PKK. I guess if you can&#39;t buy it on their platforms they don&#39;t want you looking at it lol,2021-11-11T14:15:08Z
$TNT --&gt; As of 2pm Beijing time, JD.com had already SMASHED last year&#39;s 11.11 sales total. Sitting at US$48.6B  with 10 hours to go.  
 
How much of this business did Tenet get? 618 event was 1700 transactions and $200m in loans &amp; 4m in revenue. My estimate based on figures given is 5000 transactions and $600m for revenue of $12m. However, I am hoping / praying that Tenet CRUSHES and hits $1Billion in loans for $20m in revenue, from JD.com &amp; other online marketplaces (Pinduoduo?). 
 
I believe JJ is going to proudly share these numbers as soon as he can.,2021-11-11T11:53:50Z
