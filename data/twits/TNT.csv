$TNT I hope they donâ€™t get acquired. TNT has the potential to become a multi billion dollar company IMO. I wanna ride the wave.,2022-02-11T01:25:51Z
$TNT at this price Tenet looks like a good acquisition for someone IMO. Great way to get their way in the door in China, what is that worth?,2022-02-11T00:55:42Z
$TNT the week of 21st. Thats all i can disclose.,2022-02-11T00:46:05Z
$TNT I hardly ever stop in here. honest question. will tnt have to get in the same price range that the NASDAQ requires? And if so can I do that organically? Our shares got cut in half last time So Iâ€™m hoping that they ont be the case again.

$TNT big day for fintech. Not here though. Mindless pumpers still havenâ€™t caught on.,2022-02-09T22:39:32Z
$TNT  The growth here is spectacular and the valuation is pitiful by any standard or metric.  What you do with that information can change your life.,2022-02-09T21:16:13Z
$TNT we know SEC is a joke guys and its frustrating but patience. Real money is minted buying low. It&#39;s not by chasing, they&#39;ll be chasing too when things turn around. 

Valuation RN is LOL for the rev this co is bringing in.,2022-02-09T21:11:31Z
$TNT canâ€™t wait to see the incoming SEC pump,2022-02-09T18:09:00Z
$TNT  Man, ultra thin again today,2022-02-09T17:20:33Z
$TNT clearly everyone is waiting on the sidelines until there some indication that the sec is about to approve..... strap on your seatbelts when that happens cause itll be a stampede to get back in,2022-02-09T16:50:17Z
$TNT this seems like a good company in the making just has a bad stock, which can happen. Letâ€™s hope the sp turns around in the next few months for all our sanity,2022-02-09T16:00:58Z
$TNT Another day with no buying and sitting on support. If it breaks here next stop is $3.75-4.00 CDN.  
 
Needs Nasdaq desperately, I really don&#39;t want to see another reverse split.,2022-02-09T15:09:26Z
