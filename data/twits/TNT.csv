$TNT If there is one stock not to sell in these markets itâ€™s Tenet forward P/S of 1-1,5 forward P/E around 10 and positive income the big growth stocks that are growing but losing millions and millions thatâ€™s the kind of stock I would sell right now,2022-01-23T20:42:44Z
$TNT I do wish I had taken some profit at the top but only so that I could have bought back way more shares,2022-01-23T19:33:57Z
$TNT If you are in the same boat I&#39;m in with a cost basis higher than $7-9 USD keep in mind that JJ and the other owners of Cubeler sold to Tenet for a similar cost basis.  I can&#39;t quote the exact price off the top of my head right now but I&#39;m sure someone who has time today can comment it.,2022-01-23T18:59:26Z

==== A contrarian view of the stock market ==== 
====    Doom &amp; Gloom news predictions.   ==== 
 
This Inflation is transitory, due primarily to supply side breakdowns from Covid and weather disruptions recently. Just like the short term price spikes (&amp; dips) in Lumber 2021, and the near Zero price of Oil Futures when container ships had nowhere to unload in summer of 2020. 
 
Job growth has been high in the last half of 2021. What this pandemic has done is squeezed the old business models, and made room for a reboot of numerous new economy directions. Work from Home is now going to remain for a vast majority of management and service staff. 
Don&#39;t be surprised to see some office spaces in Cities convert to spacious Condo&#39;s in the years ahead.

$TNT Management has followed the solid advice of hiring a super lawyer,2022-01-21T14:27:40Z
$TNT people already talking about $500M revenue in 2022 itâ€™s ok to speculate but remember growing from $100M to $300M is already a rare achievement by itself so shouldnâ€™t we rather stay focused on the guidance and be extremely happy if that number getâ€™s hit not looking at $500M,2022-01-21T14:02:09Z
$TNT This train continues to move forwardâ€¦ well done JJ!,2022-01-21T13:58:31Z
$TNT Can&#39;t state how BULLISH this company is right now. 
 
Great addition to the team! 
 
As JJ stated, the data is worth as much or greater to what revenue is going to be made in China. 
 
I think Tenet will generate 500M in revenue this year and over 1B next year,2022-01-21T13:55:42Z
