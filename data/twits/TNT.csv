The technical rating of $TNT is bad and it also does not present a quality setup at the moment. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/TNT/technical-analysis?key=690bddba-1b63-4685-a193-eb53e75e1267&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=TA&amp;utm_content=TNT&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2021-09-17T02:27:00Z
$TNT for new watchers and investors here, I highly recommend the StockFam discord. Excellent due diligence and ongoing analysis. And, it‚Äôs free. Scroll down to TNT/Peak Fintech once you are in. A word of the wise, the board is all about fundamentals and analysis. Not price targets.

$TNT Sean shared this article I stockfam discord. https://www.alizila.com/alibaba-helping-canadian-smbs-sell-to-china/

I found this part the most interesting:

‚ÄúThe Canadian government is working very hard to support and promote its small businesses‚Äù

Other observations: 

‚Äúwe introduce small businesses to the Alibaba ecosystem and how we can connect them with Chinese consumers and even other markets in Asia‚Ä¶.. It allows companies to set up virtual stores and sell directly to Chinese consumers, giving brands the chance to test the market without setting up a physical retail location in China.‚Äù

One is B2C and the other B2B, but does this ever validate what they are doing.

‚ÄúAnd we plan to source more Canadian products such as live seafood, including lobster, shrimp and clams, blueberries, maple syrup and ice wine.‚Äù 

Clearly the demand is there and for a variety of Canadian products. 

Once again Peak is positioning themselves in the perfect spot again. One day they will be the global business hub for B2B transactions.,2021-09-17T00:08:52Z
