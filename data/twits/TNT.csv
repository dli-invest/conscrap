$TNT :  5:36am vs 5:35pm.  Funny how the posts prior were super bullish, and now they&#39;re all soft-bashing FUD after he sold.

$TNT most pathetic stock in the last few months, 40% drop, perma bulls turning bears within 12hours blocking any talk that isn&#39;t in their vision of the stock, posting screen shots of yahoo/discord thinking it has any meaning. Pathetic,2021-12-03T04:30:14Z

$TNT &quot;&#39;If you want to issue public securities in the U.S., the firms that audit your books have to be subject to inspection by the PCAOB,‚Äù SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.&quot;

This is all great for Tenet. How else are U.S. investors going to gain exposure to Chinese growth?

$TNT why would anyone with a high degree of investing acumen only care about one ticker?? Things that make you go hmmmmm ü§î,2021-12-02T23:05:33Z
$TNT Also, the level of distrust that has seemed to have developed some on this board with Tenet&#39;s communication has gotten a little overblown in my opinion. I&#39;ve been upset with both Barry and Cathy before at the way they&#39;ve handled situations, however I also recognize that, to my knowledge, they&#39;ve never been caught in a flat lie. They are trustworthy people.

Barry gave an overly optimistic timeline once, I believe? I can&#39;t even recall it well enough now to try and quote him.

These people are people. They&#39;re human. But they&#39;re not liars.  They deserve a basic amount of trust if they say something. Contact them if you don&#39;t believe the emails circulating.,2021-12-02T22:49:50Z
$TNT If anyone wants to cast doubt on someone&#39;s Cathy or Barry email they should, first, simply try emailing them. Barry emails me back whenever I message him.,2021-12-02T22:35:23Z
$TNT Have a good day on Friday everyone. I‚Äôll be offline. Back next week.,2021-12-02T22:35:16Z
$TNT Given it‚Äôs hard for some Tenet fans to understand the concept of profit taking. I‚Äôll summarize my thought for you this way: The big boys are selling slowly while the lemmings (you) are buying. Quite simple isn‚Äôt it. I maintain a much trimmed position in Tenet. Other investments elsewhere and more importantly dry powder for the major forthcoming dip!,2021-12-02T22:15:28Z
$TNT Recent Email from Cathy - Compliments of BigMoneyBB on stocktwits:

We can‚Äôt speculate on the review process. And we are very aware of the shareholders‚Äô fears but believe me, they are a little overdone. The SEC is just doing their job. We will get relisted once we get through the process. Volatility is ramped for small caps these past few months and even larger cap co‚Äôs have dropped in half after huge gains. Patience is required. As Warren Buffett says‚Äîonce should buy when there is blood on the streets! I couldn‚Äôt agree more!

We will have news this month for sure. The Company is doing very very well.

Kind Regards
