$TNT this shit gunna pop off this year. Big money coming in!,2022-01-03T01:46:03Z
$TNT 7.8 in one day + 9.9 in one day. Will absolutely exceed projections AGAIN! Expansion and multiple uplistings to look forward to. This is an exciting time. Don‚Äôt mind the nonsense delay (which has nothing to do with fundamentals) to scoop a bit more on dips. I‚Äôll keep eating at these prices. No company makes 345M at $5-6 dollars a share with this float,2022-01-02T22:55:41Z

$TNT Walid was blocked. Stating he has the capital to move this up LOL ~~ but if any of the other penniless haters have a valid bear case involving this co not making sums of money that assure a mkt cap in a substantially higher multiple I&#39;m all ears. I have yet to hear that case all we hear is Nasdaq whining and whining that mgmt isnt dealing with Nasdaq effectively which is a small blip on the radar on the zoom out circa this time next year.,2022-01-02T21:13:35Z
$TNT doorknob on discord: 

The reasons to believe TNT is going to have a large increase in revenue in 2022 ,will be 2021 up to including Q3 only had revenue from 1 of the 5 pillars , or 20%  .  The adoption rate for the the consumer goods sector will increase ..and the other 4 pillars have huge clients. I highly believe J J  will again meet his guidance of 345 million $ .  Would not be surprised if he exceeds it by a wide margin also. He did explain in detail in the Q3  deals etc. was the most successful quarter in history . The springboard quarter to set  TNT up for future revenue growth.,2022-01-02T18:58:07Z

$TNT Anyone know if Q4 results is 45 days like Q1,2,3? Someone mentioned Q4 might be 90 days as it is given extra time being the last quarter, but he wasnt too sure. Anyone can confirm?,2022-01-01T22:56:24Z

$TNT   Smart for Tenet to identify this growing market a year ago and put it into action with it&#39;s deal with Gruppo Coin.

$TNT  Happy New Year all !

 Been a hell of a year for Tenet. Newer investors may not fully realize the scope of just how amazing 2021 was (hold on to those bags of cash through the volatility because 2022 is coming in hard on massive growth in revenue, positive earnings and execution)

I will  list some of the highlights of 2021 below in the replies as there is too many to squish into one post.,2022-01-01T09:24:40Z
$TNT is expected to show a strong revenue growth of 119.68% yearly. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/analyzer/stock/TNT?view=fundamental-analysis&amp;key=690bddba-1b63-4685-a193-eb53e75e1267&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=TNT&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-01-01T08:20:00Z

Singles Day: $7.8 million

12/12: $9.9 million

Tenet had $25.6 million revenue last quarter with no special shopping events. 

Looks like we&#39;re going to beat Q4 estimates,2021-12-31T22:33:50Z

$TNT 

Good morning/Good afternoon to everyone on the TNT stocktwits page. 

I have recently purchased my 5000th TNT share today and have been holding from my initial buy at $7.50USD while adding on the way down. 

I wrote out a 1000 word post prior to this post but accidentally lost it so I will summarize my thoughts briefly:

I have been following this stocktwits page since mid September before purchasing shares and have seen my fair share of good content (RooksL) and bad (investorguru), not to mention a symbolic office water cooler filled with kool-aid.

Tenet has been sketching me out a bit with this horrible IR-the grammar from Kathy and Barry is weak for a professional company 2 say the least (and I am no shining star). The one thing I will say is that when you have 100 flags and 94 of them are green-the red flags stick out much easier compared to a sea of 61 green flags and 39 red flags. 

3/4 largest oil companies? Cmon boys. Bullhorns. Not perma-bullhorns. Healthy skepticism.,2021-12-31T19:09:11Z
