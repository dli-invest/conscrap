$TNT Saying this once more for my fellow American amateur chart analysts: You&#39;ve got to look at the PKK chart, not the PKKFF chart. If you look at the latter, you&#39;ll scare yourself unnecessarily. The bottom is clearly in.,2021-11-09T21:35:15Z

$TNT Q3 revenue $30-$35 Million Q4 revenue $40-$45 Million,2021-11-09T14:29:06Z
$TNT --&gt; On Single&#39;s Day Revenue. 
 
It was said on the October Monthly Report that 1111 Revenue is expected to be 25 to 30% of Q4 revenue. We know the forecast for Q4 is at least $32m. $8m = 25%; $9.6m = 30% 
 
A better estimate of Q4 is $36m. $9m = 25%. $10.8m = 30%. 
 
If Q4 revenue hits $40m then $10m = 25%; $13.33m = 30%. 
 
In comparison, 618 revenue was $4m so a $12m day would be a tripling! My guess is $12m which puts Q4 revenue between $40m to $48m. 
 
We will likely get an update during the Q&amp;A next week.,2021-11-09T14:14:13Z
$TNT I&#39;ll be back soon while watching my $MNMD rocket.,2021-11-09T12:48:37Z
$TNT when q3 results?,2021-11-09T12:28:48Z
$TNT  Quarter after quarter of increasing revenue / earnings is what it&#39;s all about. Why be so wound about daily volatility?  Of course I check in to see what it does each day myself, but do I sit there micro analyzing it?  If people swing trade and short then it is necessary, but if your really investing in a company you look at each quarter / each year , not each day.

  This company has that steady growth investors are looking for.  In spite of the volatility over the last months we are still sitting on huge gains this year.

  It&#39;s all about revenue / earnings going up each quarter. If people cant understand this simple concept then maybe  growth stocks aren&#39;t for you.

  Anyways whatever people do is their choice.  Nothing posted on chat rooms will change the fact that this stock , like others will be driven by quarter after quarter of growth.  

 If this was one of those companies pulling in like 3 mill a year with debt and a bloated float I myself wouldn&#39;t be invested here.,2021-11-09T06:52:55Z

$TNT at this point , I dont even care about my avg... it&#39;s the game of accumulation at this point.  Very confident with JJ and management&#39;s execution thus far.... SP will reflect the fundamentals soon enough.,2021-11-09T01:27:31Z
$TNT the share price is obviously the delink from the fundamental of the company, the company is growing day by day. It will be short term pain for sure, look beyond 2023 and you will feel alot better. Iwill add more when my salary come in this week.,2021-11-09T00:10:06Z
