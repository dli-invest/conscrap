$TNT 

Everyone…please remember…this was an amendment to the 40F …not a 40F re-file…this is much quicker….at least it’s supposed to be, but we’re talking about the SEC here…their timeline and totally in their hands…not in Tenet’s hands…we must remain patient with a long-term investor mindset 👍🍺,2021-12-14T20:40:00Z
$TNT buckle up... this is nutz territory.,2021-12-14T20:17:52Z
$TNT I&#39;m glad to have been wrong about my earlier PTs for the day but I was not wrong about the tremendous buying opportunity under $8 CAD (Yesterday&#39;s post),2021-12-14T20:01:22Z
$TNT what&#39;s the spread like on the Canadian exchange? Here (UK) it has been as wide as 40 cent USD today, very odd but it&#39;s OTC so not that surprised tbh..,2021-12-14T19:41:05Z
$TNT not to be Debbie downer but we are still clearly in a downtrend. I would much rather have Cathy’s email say there is a 30 day period so we know it can be resolved in that time. Now it feels like we are just waiting with complete uncertainty on a timeline but hey I’m still bullish.,2021-12-14T19:32:43Z
$TNT Repost from @Stayyyyyy we are getting very close! not a 30 day period again very very nice! Lot of PR&#39;s stacked for uplisting International partner for example 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,2021-12-14T19:21:16Z
$TNT I’ve called this several times, $7.50 CAN is bottom. Bounced back up each time. Trade accordingly.,2021-12-14T19:19:34Z
$TNT And just like that… people thinking they have until January to buy back in may miss the boat❣️,2021-12-14T19:10:29Z
$TNT  I want to ring in the New Year with some TNT 🧨 baby!,2021-12-14T19:06:03Z
$TNT please run more so my margin call goes away. Thx.,2021-12-14T19:04:19Z

$TNT $8 cad😄 the obligatory “someone knows something…”,2021-12-14T18:22:43Z
$TNT let&#39;s see if my macro synopsis plays out rest of the month into Q1. Fed fear overblown? Guys IDK these days 5 years back if you told us the 2020-2021 events we&#39;d have been like LMAO.... 

But logic usually wins.,2021-12-14T17:41:18Z
$TNT we are green on volume that is almost equal to what we had yesterday’s red day.,2021-12-14T16:26:51Z
$TNT Let’s stay positive! We actually have sales and contracts. There is intrinsic value here. That’s the bottom line.,2021-12-14T16:21:18Z
$TNT Starting to think not being on NASDAQ might have been a good thing. UPST getting slaughtered.,2021-12-14T16:15:32Z
$TNT let them keep selling amongst themselves , even if its $6...  they&#39;ll keep scalping from whoever is scared or weak.   

I&#39;ll keep nibbling a few each day as well while they keep playing.,2021-12-14T16:14:30Z
$SAVE $TNT Adding to both!,2021-12-14T16:02:46Z
$TNT the only sure thing is if I sell off my position right now, this will get relisted and shoot up to $13 tomorrow.😩,2021-12-14T15:46:19Z
$TNT LOL..... 5.xx$ It looks like that we will not have a nice Christmas in 2021.... 2022? 2023?,2021-12-14T15:36:16Z
$TNT The amount of decline to be had in any stock price is based on a percentage of it&#39;s previous gain. So the bigger the gain, the bigger the potential dip. That&#39;s what happened yesterday. 

It&#39;s also why Shorts say things like &quot;this stock gives back all its gains&quot;. No stock goes straight up, and it&#39;s a common market dynamic. Take a look at the longer term trend to see that this isn&#39;t true.

I&#39;m looking for PKK to bottom then bounce off the 200 day SMA for a close above the 200 EMA. This has happened the last 6 times the stock price got to this level. That&#39;s an approximate bottom around 7.30 with an approximate close above 7.50.,2021-12-14T14:00:47Z
