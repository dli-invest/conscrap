$TNT I‚Äôll keep loading the boat under $10 üí™üî•,2021-09-15T00:26:15Z
$TNT if you can‚Äôt handle the market volatility, then you shouldn‚Äôt be in it. Peak put out a wowzer news release today. Sit and wait. Cubelar should be finalized any moment and then we roll. It‚Äôs all about the international Business Hub and first mover advantage. Go Peak Go!,2021-09-15T00:10:30Z
$TNT   Just a kind request. Can you guys posting YouTube or other videos say ‚Äúrepost from 2 weeks ago‚Äù so we don‚Äôt waste time clicking thinking it‚Äôs something new?,2021-09-14T23:57:45Z

$TNT Unless something fundamentally changes, I see days like this as opportunities.  I bought more. Did I buy at the absolute low today? No, but that&#39;s why I believe in DCA.

Dilution/MM. If people are worried about this acquisition and dilution, they need to read the details further. For TNT to scale, there will be bigger deals will be forthcoming.  TNT is about growth, if you want value, there are better names for that. 

MMs will do what they do. No point in talking about the nonsense that goes on there and SEC choosing not to address this. 

Fintech continues to be ultra hot, one of my private investments 5x in valuation from 6 months ago.

Let&#39;s go.,2021-09-14T22:08:28Z

$TNT ......LOL...OMG PEOPLE! Some of these posts got me shaking my head. You nervous investors need to chill the $*&amp;% out. Tell me (those of you that bought in after the listing) that you didn&#39;t see posts that warned off a sell off or dip after listing. Cause if you didn&#39;t, it shows your lack of experience,  your failure to perform any DD or, at the very least, stay current on any post on this board. Just relax....set a stop loss if you have to (not recommend) or just set this aside and check in every few weeks....you are going to be fine!,2021-09-14T21:12:03Z
$TNT what a great day for long term investors. I have tons of dry power‚Ä¶the more it drops the more I buy‚Ä¶getting paid on this coming Friday, y‚Äôall know where extra monies will go,2021-09-14T21:02:36Z
$TNT it‚Äôs down AH 10% on Yahoofinance. Is this correct ?,2021-09-14T20:59:47Z
$TNT Increased position by 175% today.,2021-09-14T20:43:42Z
$TNT looks like China is at it again flexing their muscles on companies and wonder how that will effect TNT. Johnson needs to come out and keep us updated that they are having issues or doing fine.,2021-09-14T20:35:59Z
$TNT why is this going down. everything is line up to fly up. This isnt making sens.,2021-09-14T20:33:19Z
$TNT who scooped up some cheap warrants? üëåüèº,2021-09-14T20:31:49Z
$TNT All of PKK&#39;s fundamentals point to expanding verticals and explosive growth. News like the one today will multiply the company&#39;s value year to year. Technicals will do what they do, trade it if you can. Otherwise, sit back and relax.,2021-09-14T20:23:31Z
$TNT  Per Fidelity 756,000 shares traded today.  Thats less than 1% of all shares.  If there was a problem I think a lot more shares would have traded than less than 1%.  

Lots can happen with an up-listing and many know it so... This was profit taking and the mm taking out stops. Add to that news about DILUTION and now the algos get involved and add more selling.  So what we have nothing more than price stabilization especially on a new exchange.

This is when you should be buying.  

I went shopping today bought:  mkty, pdsb, alto, ar, am, rtlr,2021-09-14T20:18:55Z
$TNT Honestly red day like this makes me feel happy. Seeing there are still people who have no idea of the potential here and are only looking at the stock price tells me that we are still under the radar. If it‚Äôs more red tomorrow I‚Äôll be even more excited. The company is not the stock. We are capturing market share and setting up for an exponentially explosive future. I know where this will be 5 years from now.,2021-09-14T20:15:19Z
$TNT I m holding all my shares and warrants. I m looking at it as a long term investment to build my wealth. If JJ execute the revenues as his guidance this stock will trade 80+ within in few years. I m not risking my shares for any shirt term gains or getting my TFSA flagged as day trading...,2021-09-14T20:13:04Z
$TNT üòÇüòÇ,2021-09-14T20:12:02Z
$TNT I am not 1% worried Upstart had the same bumps, The facts is revenue will go up for 12 quarters + till the point of $250M + each quarter you think this bump is dangerous when you look at it from a year Ofcourse not! Turn off the emotions and fears and wait for a year you will be happy that you waited I can promise you 100-200% gains 1 year and wayyyyyyyyyy more in 2-3 years just be patient and buy more or be patient and wait for some years. Going to be great RIDE GLTA  
 
Again this kinda corrections is part of it 
Eventually this will be a $50-$300 stock and this is the only truth IDC what anyone has to say,2021-09-14T20:10:42Z
$TNT Typical dump after uplisting,2021-09-14T20:09:53Z
$TNT rooks baby  gone ??,2021-09-14T20:09:41Z
$TNT down 20% since uplisting but there‚Äôs no cause for worry. Clueless,2021-09-14T20:04:18Z
$TNT think I bought the top ooof,2021-09-14T20:00:15Z
$TNT Grim day but picked up some more shares..We could do with a couple of green days tbh..,2021-09-14T20:00:12Z
$TNT   

Is the share price really down almost 10% on a whopping 800,000 shares (US) or abt 1% of 80m shares? 

and that‚Äôs why when you turn on cnbc and listen to the wall street guys talk abt the stock market you need to know they are billionaires on your money.  been there and just trying to help.

if you have conviction to TNT or any stock in this disruptive, growth period we are in, hang in there.  retail emotion is the greatest asset wall street has and largest risk for a retail investor.,2021-09-14T19:57:01Z
