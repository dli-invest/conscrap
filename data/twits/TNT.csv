$TNT The pending news is the result of the Canadian election.,2021-09-21T02:45:23Z
$TNT Will you just relax. There is nothing to be read between lines when the Nasdaq site states “News Pending”. That’s it news pending…not form with wrong date, not T12, not anything. You can read and understand what News Pending means. 
We know there are great positive catalysts this month, so it’s one of them. See you tomorrow.,2021-09-21T02:42:59Z
$TNT  Looks like they just forgot to file a &#39;material change&#39; when they were uplisted to the Nasdaq.   Notification gone on the nasdaq.com,2021-09-21T02:19:10Z
$TNT This is exciting, can&#39;t wait to see what drops tomorrow.,2021-09-21T02:06:49Z

$TNT  blah , putting myself in the penalty box , no posting for the rest of the week ,  bye,2021-09-21T01:53:38Z
$TNT haha @zpng blocked me for being a &quot;basher.&quot; Seriously? I&#39;m just trying to figure out what&#39;s going on. Are we that sensitive on this board?,2021-09-21T01:42:30Z
$TNT Did some digging.   My bet the halt is because they filed this with the wrong date of 9-25-2021.  https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001558924/000155892412000002/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml,2021-09-21T01:36:39Z

$TNT Let&#39;s just hope it&#39;s not a T12 like someone said below. Per my Google search, most T12s never resume trading..... Hopefully it&#39;s just a T1 and has to do with Cuebler news,2021-09-21T01:31:10Z
$TNT  wtf seeing conflicting reasons now from different sources,2021-09-21T01:29:44Z
$TNT Why would they ask for additional information now and not prior to listing.?? They’ve had tons of time to do so. Makes no sense.,2021-09-21T01:28:41Z

halted for news pending not T12 dont listen to lying bashers do your DD!! The are trying hard to steal your shares. Hold and get rich.,2021-09-21T01:20:18Z
$TNT @killmenow is right. T12s aren&#39;t usually good. T1 or T5 halts are normally no reason for alarm but T12 is usually not positive,2021-09-21T01:15:43Z
$TNT if you just Google T12 Halt it’s almost always a bad thing. Sonofabitch.,2021-09-21T01:09:13Z
$TNT  merger perhaps?.   UPST would be crazy not to just throw $7B at this, which is chump change to them.,2021-09-21T01:06:48Z
$TNT,2021-09-21T01:06:18Z
$TNT let’s go!!,2021-09-21T01:04:39Z
$TNT why would they request a halt for good news?,2021-09-21T00:59:01Z
$TNT  Peak bought out by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. for $52.70 per share !!!!,2021-09-21T00:42:58Z
$TNT interesting order flow for Canadian side today. Also we are halted pending news,2021-09-20T23:50:52Z
$TNT Halted… due to News Pending”… I can’t wait. Cubeler purchase, international partner, etc.. which one will it be? So exciting!,2021-09-20T23:50:36Z
$TNT Let the fun begin!  We are halted!,2021-09-20T23:42:49Z
$TNT trade halt (T12) was alerted within seconds at tradethehalt.com with the halt price of $9.11 and volume of 750.96K.,2021-09-20T23:19:02Z
$TNT mostly got low 9s but did get a limit order filled of 8.9 in the afternoon.

I’m not too worried about timing the bottoms completely. I’m just happy to get closer to my 500 share goal before this hits $15.,2021-09-20T21:48:20Z
