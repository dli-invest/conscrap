$TNT crazy action on the tape again today.  Whoever is using cibc keeps taking it down with cibc to cibc trades (cant be a coincidence if it happens over and over again) , they ended up accumulating over 50k shares net , of course it may be higher depending on others using cibc.,2022-01-13T02:42:18Z
$TNT why aren&#39;t I rich yet?,2022-01-13T02:10:57Z
$TNT just took position at end of day. wtf was that dump ?,2022-01-12T21:39:29Z
$TNT perusing the MSM headlines today you see downplay of Omicron. Fed no nuke. Biden asking to money printer(def going to keep printing)--- was a rough one but called it as per usual as Macro is my thing. 

Some of you thought lockdowns, Fed nuke, asteroid hitting the planet---- 

If you did I advise to take a look at Cathie Woods write up on small caps, crypto and Fintech--- everything blasted in this artificial correction and realize you&#39;ll want to be in those sectors in the coming months. 

And we await price discovery. Bullish AF here.,2022-01-12T21:33:13Z
$TNT ah there she is. Heading back down to the basement. Classic.,2022-01-12T20:11:07Z
$TNT Expect they file the F40 tonight or tomorrow the last step before the uplisting! This is 100% the last filing before the Nasdaq uplisting gets approved and this is the last time i‚Äôll talk about it

After that Nasdaq obession is done and listed this will fly, The next quartely numbers will be amazing and a lot of pr‚Äôs are coming üöÄ,2022-01-12T18:49:43Z

$TNT got to take a moment to RIP to everyone in the market who panic sold into the bottom bids. Puke into the bottom is the way to wealth they say. 

Everyone&#39;s a macro expert cuz CNN and MSNBC said.... 

Hey wheres our Omicron lockdown and Fed 5% rate hike nuke?,2022-01-12T17:30:06Z
$TNT  fair value without nasdaq is $10.   Whoever was selling blocks in the past few weeks most have finally stopped.  It has to be sheldon.,2022-01-12T17:28:18Z
$TNT Sold some other stocks and finally bought more. Could not resist at these levels. 6K shares strong. For me this is a lot and a very big chunk of my PF.  
 
I am 27 years old and I becoming a millionaire before age 32 doesn&#39;t sound too bad. Not selling a share until 2025 if they keep hitting revenue targets.

$TNT &quot;The delay in listing to the NASDAQ will not impact our guidance for this year... we anticipate that everything will be resolved... what we&#39;ve seen from our dealings with the SEC, there is no reason to believe that at the end of the process our registration statement won&#39;t become effective, which means that we should get back on the NASDAQ... The process has been going well with the SEC, the exchanges have been very cordial... I ask everyone to be patient... The process is running it&#39;s course, let&#39;s just let it run it&#39;s course. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s going to be a week, two weeks, a month or 60 days, I do not know at this point. But at the end of the day, I think what they&#39;re doing is a good thing and will benefit everyone.&quot; -- Joseph Johnson, CEO of Tenet. Skip to 34:00 to verify quote

There are two bulls standing on a hill overlooking a pasture full of cows. The younger bull, eager, but lacking experience, says to the old bull ‚ÄúHey, let‚Äôs run down there and f@#k ourselves a cow.‚Äù The old bull, who has spent season after season in this pasture, turns to the younger bull, chuckles, and replies ‚ÄúNah, how about we walk down there, and f@#k them all.‚Äù,2022-01-12T12:09:29Z
