$TNT Someone should make a post that Peak has revealed in their amended 40-F they intend to sell one of their subsidiaries, ASFC. I&#39;m sure there are a significant amount of people who have blocked me who would like to know that. Just do me a favor and give credit where credit is due in regard to me reading over the 40-F and seeing and reporting this info. first. 

I&#39;ll make my intentions clear:  I&#39;d like to show those who blocked me that I contribute to the board, and they&#39;ve made a mistake. It may sound petty, but if you ever have to go through the experience of reading bits and pieces of conversations on a board, you&#39;ll understand my frustration.,2021-10-28T00:39:28Z
$TNT excellent update on Peak‚Äôs guidance and Nasdaq listing!

$TNT I want to personally thank @StockGuruJr for shorting.

$TNT Check out the 2 new subsidiaries mentioned on page 15 of the Form 40.  Yes, Peak hasn‚Äôt announced these yet.

$TNT so what happened with that shareholder meeting today? anybody know? any good news?,2021-10-27T17:51:42Z
$TNT I‚Äôve been I. Meeting all morning long what‚Äôs the news? SEC gave us the ok to go back on the Nasdaq?,2021-10-27T16:54:12Z
$TNT each day now it‚Äôs been opening high and closing higher than the previous day. Sounds good to me. Slow and steady upward daily movement.,2021-10-27T16:46:30Z
$TNT Very surprising the SP has moved back down to around $8.30 USD For the hold outs waiting for the dip opportunity post NASDAQ listing, I would suggest averaging in and buying at least some now. Personally I don&#39;t believe we&#39;ll see a dip post NASDAQ listing. I think we&#39;ll ride flat for a few days, then when Tutes realize they now have an opportunity to gain exposure into China growth through a reputable company, we&#39;ll üöÄüöÄüöÄ,2021-10-27T16:45:54Z
$TNT Lets hope the Shorts holdout for maximum pain!,2021-10-27T16:36:46Z
$TNT nobody is selling. Trading on the Nasdaq will bring back the volume. üß®,2021-10-27T15:40:45Z
$TNT To honor an agreement I made with @DDcap concerning this 40-F and the concerns I had, I&#39;m more than happy to say:

Okay I&#39;m good now ü§ù,2021-10-27T15:16:19Z
$TNT &quot;As we own a majority equity interest in, and have control over, the voting shares of each of our Chinese operating subsidiaries, based on the definition and characteristics of what the FASB considers to be a VIE, we believe that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries is a VIE.&quot;

The headline of this paragraph started with: &quot; Peak is not a VIE... &quot;

They&#39;re smashing all FUD in this amendment,2021-10-27T15:10:07Z
$TNT &quot;Additionally, in the case of ASFC, another primary objective was to demonstrate to banks and other financial institutions that they could safely and efficiently make loans and extend credit to small and medium size enterprises using our Business Hub.  In establishing ASFC, we did not intend to enter the business of lending.  We simply used ASFC as a manner of attracting banking and financial institutions as clients that would thereafter use our technology services offered in the Business Hub.  As ASFC has now served its marketing purpose, we intend to dispose of our interest in that company.&quot;

They&#39;re going to get rid of ASFC. There went the last of my concerns!,2021-10-27T15:07:58Z
$TNT Happy for today‚Äôs development. Hopefully it can hold gains. It‚Äôs annoying when it has large swings like this. I mean who is selling at these cheap levels anyways?
Maybe slowly but will get there! üöÄ üåù,2021-10-27T14:57:14Z
$TNT &quot;Certain individuals in China may perceive us as a potential bribery target. As such we may be approached by local individuals in China, whether businessmen, government officials or others, to offer us certain favors that would advance our business interests in exchange for cash or other forms of compensation, or threaten to hinder our progress unless compensated in cash or by other means, all of which could violate Chinese laws as well as Canadian and U.S. law. Although we have never engaged, and will never knowingly engage, in such transactions and will report any such offers or threats to the appropriate local authorities, there can be no assurances that we will succeed in preventing individuals looking to engage in such transactions from adversely impacting our operations&quot;

To sum that up, the company just stated to the SEC and to investors that have never done shady business and never will do shady business, even if it ends up killing us!,2021-10-27T14:47:35Z
$TNT Here&#39;s a link to the additional portions of the 40-F that were requested by SEC. If it&#39;s on SEC&#39;s EDGAR it has been filed, and if it has been filed, it has been accepted by the SEC. Absent some extraordinary unexpected bs (which is always possible in this crazy world) we&#39;re all systems GO! üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ
