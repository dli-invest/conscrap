$TNT have to laugh at how sure pseudo macro analysts were about a monster rate hike to nuke the markets. 

Expect more policy backtracking btw from current admin and add that to your own forecasts cuz it&#39;s relevant. They did everything this year to scare and beat up growth and next year expect reversal.,2021-12-15T23:44:13Z

$TNT ü•±$8 support has held again. At this point it could just take 1 day to simultaneously break out of that ~9.40 resistance and that downtrend which has formed over time.,2021-12-15T21:55:50Z

$TNT [15s. delayed]: Issued Press Release on December 15, 15:21:00: SHAREHOLDER ALERT: Levi &amp;amp; Korsinsky, LLP Reminds Shareholders of T https://s.flashalert.me/cgmkA,2021-12-15T20:36:00Z
SHAREHOLDER ALERT: Levi &amp;amp, Korsinsky, LLP Reminds Shareholders of Tenet Fintech Group Inc. of a Class Action Lawsuit and a Lead Plaintiff Deadline of January 18, 2022 - PKKFF, TNT https://conferencecalltranscripts.com/summary/?id=347563&amp;pr=true $TNT,2021-12-15T20:23:05Z
$TNT average down on $FOBIF or add more to $TNT? Honey answers please.,2021-12-15T18:06:27Z
$TRIT Bought some more. So getting delisted is bad and having no audited financials is bad huh? Ok lets compare to Tenet fintech:
 $TNT vs $TRIT
Listing: delisted | listed(for now at least)
Category: Financing Fintech | Financing Fintech
Marketcap: ~$500 million | ~$288 million
Earnings: ~$0 | $27 million (2020)
Revenue: ~$66 million | ~$39 million (2020, before IB acquisition)
Audited?: Not trying | Not yet
Doing business in: China | Singapore
cash-debt: ~$50million | ~$130 million last self reported

So at these prices, 3 possibilities: 
1. we go go to OTC, no more silence period rules and no audit requirements. If new unaudited financials are at least as good as old ones then we go up. 
2. Trit releases financials and we go up hard.
3. OTC and terrible financials or no financials, then its not pretty but we still have legal options.

$TNT I think it&#39;s a fantastic stock. Am in it for the long term so daily volatility passes me by. Lovely to own and look forward to 2023-2025. Personally, I see TNT as one of the rare opportunities as an investor to get high returns and therefore buy in monthly regardless of the price.,2021-12-15T10:39:59Z
