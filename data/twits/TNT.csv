$TNT at this point , I dont even care about my avg... it&#39;s the game of accumulation at this point.  Very confident with JJ and management&#39;s execution thus far.... SP will reflect the fundamentals soon enough.,2021-11-09T01:27:31Z
$TNT the share price is obviously the delink from the fundamental of the company, the company is growing day by day. It will be short term pain for sure, look beyond 2023 and you will feel alot better. Iwill add more when my salary come in this week.,2021-11-09T00:10:06Z
$TNT I don&#39;t agree with anything @StockGuruJr says,2021-11-09T00:04:14Z
$TNT so @SAKDOS agrees with me now. Been saying this for months but anyways,2021-11-08T23:56:43Z
$TNT Read some comments earlier about support being broken, however because Tenet is primarily traded on the Canadian exchange, it&#39;s important to look at PKK to find support. It would appear that $9.25 CAD has been set today as clear support.

To break that down into the simplest terms, I&#39;m now pretty confident that was the lowest we will go.

Tenet community, if you want to keep that support up, do yourself and all of us a favor and buy some more Tenet while it&#39;s at a discount price. I give you my word that I will be setting some buy orders for tomorrow.,2021-11-08T23:36:58Z

$TNT well grabbed about 50 more shares between 7.45-7.55. Nice to be able to average down a bit. Sitting at 7.90 average now.,2021-11-08T21:44:03Z
$TNT I tried to prep the board for this yesterday evening. Everyone okay?,2021-11-08T21:34:54Z

$SAVA glad I found out about this stock today. Great potential to cure a terrible disease. 

Long: $TNT $PQEFF $TSLA $AMPD.CA,2021-11-08T20:11:52Z
$TNT wait, the ticker TNT came out on Nasdaq weeks before the name change to Tenet. Am I right?,2021-11-08T20:02:10Z
$TNT Whats up with the latest news for TNT on Stocktwits?,2021-11-08T20:00:49Z
$TNT Be nice if Stocktwits could fix their graph or map it back to PKKFF. Every few days I check in and forget and think it went down 10% haha,2021-11-08T19:51:51Z
$TNT It will be unfortunate if ER comes out before NASDAQ. We know what happened when guidance was announced with no NASDAQ.....nothing. 
 
The problem isn&#39;t with the numbers, the problem is many people might not believe them.  
 
Iv decided its worth the risk, but judging by today&#39;s action some people are losing their stomach.,2021-11-08T19:49:29Z
$TNT IMO - New Exchange Margin requirements all b/c of recent name change to #Tenet appears to be forcing some #Diamond #Hands to dump their shares

#Nasdaq re-list, and Q3 Financials canâ€™t get here soon enough!!!,2021-11-08T19:36:16Z
$TNT Latest guidance shows the stock is cheap if they live up to their guidance: &#39;21 revenue $109m (5.6 P/S), &#39;22 revenue $345m (1.79 P/S) and &#39;23 revenue $814m (0.76 P/S). Other fintechs like $MA and $V have p/s around 20, and $PYPL is around 11. So Peak is trading at half of $PYPL multiple, a fourth of $MA and $V, and the implied price growth for Peak if it hits its &#39;23 revenues and even just gets to $PYPL&#39;s multiple would be  14.5x or a stock price of $111.59 based on comparable p/s multiples. Not going to get their overnight, but with patience $10k in peak today = $145k in 2 yrs.,2021-11-08T18:59:04Z

$TNT waiting for this to be on all platforms to buy. HURRY UP!,2021-11-08T18:07:41Z
$TNT Now would be a bad time to panic and sell. 40-F submitted after extensive discussion with SEC, Q3 financials coming up soon and tons of NRs in the pipeline. Hold through this tough time and we will see TNT evolves to achieve its full potential.,2021-11-08T18:04:11Z

$TNT I am putting this out there before Q3 earnings.  TNT will be doing around 60M+ in revenue.  I am still eating popcorn and enjoying the show, however, now I have to graduate to a larger waste size.  We should be trading back on the Nasdaq no later around Nov 27.  30 days after they submitted their amended form 40F.,2021-11-08T17:05:39Z
