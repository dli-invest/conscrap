$TNT yes can be bought through TDA.,2021-11-19T02:27:26Z
$TNT can anyone confirm/deny this can be bought through TDA right now? 

Transfer will go through tomorrow and I‚Äôm putting 3k for shares down if possible.  

If not, brainstorming either to add to my other  investments or save up for the end of the month during relisting.  Thanks üòä,2021-11-19T01:49:41Z
$TNT 18,568 shares strong on this company. Beast in the making, fundamentals line up, extraordinary growth trajectory. I‚Äôll take these discounted share prices any day of the week!,2021-11-19T00:58:30Z
$TNT @petethesneak Funny Pete The Stink comes out of the shadows days before up list. Your game is predictable and weak. Thanks for just proving that the wick is about to get lit. TeNET,2021-11-19T00:51:53Z
$TNT every bull having fun losing money here?,2021-11-19T00:29:19Z
$TNT The share price doubled when we went from Q1&#39;s $15 million to Q2&#39;s $30 million revenue. Now we&#39;re down 16-17% from a drop to $25 million from $30, which 5 million away from 30 is also a 16-17% decrease. Perhaps we&#39;ve seen the worst of this. ü§∑,2021-11-19T00:25:05Z
$TNT the longs are calm... some even freestyling... let the uninformed sell and try to time this... I added the day before and had to again last night. will keep going.. drip into this on red days... good luck!,2021-11-19T00:07:20Z
$TNT ‚ú®Not a word from Discord‚Ä¶ Yahoo crying, StockTwits sighing,
Everyone discussing their plight, in hopes that the NASDAQ would soon be in sight.

&#39;Twas the night after Thanksgiving when all through the house 
not a creature was stirring, not even a PC mouse,

When the Shareholders were nestled all snug in their beds; 
While visions of TeNeT danced in their heads; 

With a wink of his eye and a twist of his head JJ 
soon gave the shorts something to dread.
He spoke not a word, but went straight to work,
let loose a NR then turned with a jerk, take that you shorts he said..who were no longer insight!
And to the shareholders, have a goodnightüòâ,2021-11-18T23:58:50Z
$TNT this is down nearly 50% over the past 45 days. That‚Äôs fucking pitiful.,2021-11-18T23:05:53Z

$TNT why is the stock price is so low? I see so many new projets.. the price should be higher. Im confuse.,2021-11-18T21:47:51Z
$TNT people stop talking about the stock price‚Ä¶ just look at it in 3-6 months we will be up anyway you are wasting your time this is how the stock market works. It‚Äôs just dirt cheap right now going down means better prices we know it is a conservative $50 stock in a year just stop posting and posting about the daily stock price doesn‚Äôt matter,2021-11-18T21:33:30Z
$TNT If you owned a house worth $400,000 and people kept knocking on your door offering you $200,000, would you panic,  take them seriously, and sell ? Or ignore them until you get what your house is worth ? Welcome to the stock market.,2021-11-18T21:21:29Z
$TNT welcome to the market where manipulation is damn obvious and no regulators will do anything about it. The only thing we can do is take the opportunity to buy the dip! I&#39;m prepared to buy another $11k worth of shares once TD received my wired transfer.,2021-11-18T21:17:17Z

$TNT Feel like I&#39;m deja vu&#39;ing the final days of the private placement process earlier in the year...  That proved to be one hell of an opportunity for those who had the cash on hand to play it.  Best of luck to those of you playing this similarly.,2021-11-18T20:33:19Z
$TNT This shits getting old. Inverse H&amp;S failed, looks like we‚Äôre plunging to 6s.,2021-11-18T20:22:13Z
$TNT complete crazy it‚Äôs going down. I just hope this means it‚Äôs bracing for lift off. Manipulation right ?,2021-11-18T20:19:52Z
$TNT People in the market today are the stupidest. TNT dropping daily on consistent great news. This should have easily went back in the 10s today alone.,2021-11-18T20:14:59Z
$TNT Many ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù stocks are having a serious dip‚Ä¶ BABA NIO NIU to name some‚Ä¶. Has it something to do with the reaction on that tennis player who has been vanished from the earth and related to that some countries starting to make statements of banning Beijing games like Biden just did‚Ä¶. Who knows‚Ä¶ time will tell but I hope it will reverse soon.,2021-11-18T19:58:48Z
