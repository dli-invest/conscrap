$TNT been researching ARKX as a possible small position and learnt it took 79 days for the SEC to approve once filed. Not a big point, I&#39;m bullish on TNT and have a small position but we&#39;re not quite at this deadline and that was for a fund which passed without any hiccups. I&#39;m very happy remaining patient on this and palantir (for different reasons),2021-11-14T05:08:06Z
$TNT have the normal rational investors at least realize who the cheerleader clowns are by now? Careful who you listen to and group think is an awful thing here.,2021-11-14T03:52:42Z
$TNT there were rumours earlier in the year about giving out a small dividend just to show how PKK can pull money out of China for the investors.   Even a $2mm dividend as a test means each person gets about 2cents per share.... I mean i don&#39;t mind that as a xmas bonus if they just want to test it out....i&#39;m all for it.,2021-11-13T21:21:37Z
$TNT $30-$36 M for Q3 $40-$45 for Q4,2021-11-13T20:01:20Z
$TNT from guidance we still have approximately 4 million net profits (H2) coming so q3 should be atleast 1-2 million and with the oil and gas vertical making up for the 618 event and organic growth (red bull), we should definitely see Q3 revenues 32-36 million minimum, anything less I believe would be a disappointment,2021-11-13T19:13:19Z
$TNT either this quarter or for sure next quarter we will start seeing substantial profits being generated. That&#39;s one the main reasons this is my biggest holding. Not only does it have massive growth but also profitability which many of the tech stocks trading on the nasdaq with market caps in the billions can&#39;t say,2021-11-13T15:59:14Z
$TNT i&#39;m guessing conservatively b/w $36-$38 mm ..... Positive net income.  Should be in the 40s for Q4.,2021-11-13T01:47:15Z
$TNT  Solid day today :)  

   Keep in mind for Q3 Monday the guidance for Q3 and Q4 combined is approx. 64 mill with an upside on the positive earnings end. 

 My guess would be a little lower this one then a little higher Q4 to make up that 64 number. They are in the middle of expansion and hiring etc. too so expenses up a bit higher Q3 and Q4 as well.

  Next years guidance is WAY higher so that , imo , is where we will begin to see the massive increases.,2021-11-13T01:35:38Z
$TNT Monday Q3 numbers will be coming out.  If we make 30 Million plus we are golden.  I am shooting for around 60 Million as a top end.  Anything above 30M is amazing!,2021-11-12T22:38:55Z
$TNT ; strap your seat belts - we‚Äôre launching soon üöÄ,2021-11-12T22:01:50Z
$TNT üö® from Barry: ‚ÄúQ3 Earnings will be released 8am Monday morning and will include a link to the live Q&amp;A webcast to be held on Tuesday at 4:30pm EST‚Äù,2021-11-12T21:35:02Z
$TNT 

What‚Äôs your average after listing, delisting, OTC lockout etc‚Ä¶.

I‚Äôve averaged both up and down - 

As of now average $8.33

Unable to go lower since none of the three trading platforms I‚Äôm using will allow purchases of Tenet - liquidation only.

This includes the dickheads at Tradestation who said ‚ÄúOperations can stop any stock trade, and they don‚Äôt need a reason and don‚Äôt have to explain the decision‚Äù.,2021-11-12T21:11:26Z

$TNT I think we‚Äôll hear something from the SEC after December when they get off the playground from their recess. From Federal, state to local government, Everything is shut down after Veterans Day. Taking annual leave to holidays.,2021-11-12T20:18:20Z

$TNT Does anyone know where i can download short interest information for markets ??,2021-11-11T22:26:35Z
$TNT These margin requirements from Fidelity are no fun especially with the low daily volume traded, the risk profiles change dramatically.   Look forward to #Nasdaq daily volumes.,2021-11-11T21:53:14Z
