$TNT If you missed reading the last montlhy report, they started the process to uplist on the TSX.

While  
the process to get the Issuer‚Äôs common shares re-instated for trading on the 
Nasdaq stock exchange was ongoing, the Issuer began the process to have  
its common shares listed on a senior stock exchange in Canada.,2021-11-25T00:17:11Z

MUST WATCH. 
Every time the shorts post about fake investigation ads.. we should share &#39;REAL&#39; news. We all must do our part to stop them from flooding the chat with nonsense.,2021-11-25T00:02:09Z

$TNT  yeeesss.... Levi &amp; Korsinski!  I knew they sounded familiar.

Check this out...I remember it well before some serious gains.  The charts (That&#39;s CVM from 2019) actually look eerily similar leading up to the &quot;investigation&quot; , which btw someone actually called them a couple weeks later and (surprisingly of course ha) it had been dropped.
This is a guarantee IMO that shorts are almost done here and trying to cover one last time

$TNT From James yahoo

I had a call with Barry at Tenet. He confirmed that if SEC doesn&#39;t respond within 30 days they can automatically reapply to NASDAQ. He said their NASDAQ approval still stands and will not have to be redone. He said it is typically a 48 hour turn around to get put back on. The 27th is a Saturday so he said the SEC will likely use Monday as their last day. If there are no new notes (and so far there haven&#39;t been any) then they can reapply and should be back on by Wednesday/Thursday next week. If they do have notes they do not have to go through another long approval period. They will just have to accommodate the notes and they will be good to go. He honestly seemed unbothered and confident by the whole thing. 

I also asked about the new law firms. He said their lawyers are dealing with it and it doesn&#39;t worry them in the slightest as the Grizzly report was complelty discredited. 

Tenet is getting the job doneüí™üèæ,2021-11-24T14:30:17Z
$TNT so at what point do you think stock twits will ever get the price right? Lol,2021-11-24T14:19:36Z
