$TNT when tf they gona fix the chart and price in stocktwits?,2021-11-02T02:53:33Z
$TNT I‚Äôm not quite sure why everyone is so hung up on a website for a company that doesn‚Äôt make revenue through their website.

Yeah it would have been nice to have rolled everything out at once but it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre a web retailer or social media site.,2021-11-02T02:01:09Z

$TNT $10 USD EoY. Q3 results priced in with new guidance. Be happy if Nasdaq uplisting even happens by then. Theres big cracks in the armor appearing daily, hopefully JJ can fix them.,2021-11-02T01:38:29Z
$TNT 70470F308 did reserve tenetfintech.com.  It would have been nice to see a new website today but I guess it&#39;s still in the works.  Someone posted that Barry mentioned that   https://brandlucent.ca/en is working on it along with the Tenet branding.   Why they decided to go ahead and do it now ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.  Maybe they were questioned about the TNT ticker..idk.    I know, the website isn&#39;t that important now but I was looking forward to seeing it.  The Ping An news and revised guidance trumps these cosmetic issues.,2021-11-02T01:14:45Z
$TNT [15s. delayed]: Issued Press Release on November 01, 17:58:00: ROSEN, NATIONAL TRIAL LAWYERS, Encourages Peak Fintech Group Inc. Inve https://s.flashalert.me/s6xqg,2021-11-01T22:00:56Z
$TNT I haven&#39;t glanced through the recent measages yet but since it&#39;s a  Red day that means cocksockers like @StockGuruJr and @Johnny_Geezy are out spreading FUD again aren&#39;t they?

If you&#39;re a new investor and a little behind on your due diligence, block those two retards.  It won&#39;t do you any good reading anything they post. It&#39;s all garbage, FUD and rooted on idiocy. 

Go to the discord group where their likes are immediately ban hammered because of spamming the same questions and comments over and over.,2021-11-01T21:22:06Z

$TNT Thought we were getting  NASDAQ today, instead my shares disappeared and I can&#39;t trade. I am told this is because of the name change but nothing appears to have changed if you go on the companies website lol

Another fun day in PKK land....or TNT.... or  *blank* as its showing in the TD app. Tomorrow is another day I guess, PKK&#39;s motto.,2021-11-01T18:30:07Z

$TNT I was trying to find info on the warrant for the canadian side, but can&#39;t find a clear info. I saw some info about 3.5$ strike price, but for 1 warrant you get to buy the share for 3.5$ ? Seem pretty cheap, or maybe it&#39;s 1/2 shares...
Anyway if someone have this info,  thank you !,2021-11-01T15:45:53Z

$TNT if you can‚Äôt properly buy or sell shares please don‚Äôt,  I‚Äôd prefer not to read for the next three weeks about unsettled trades and missing share value., etc, etc. Just sit back and buy a Pumpkin spiced latte and chill.,2021-11-01T14:28:43Z
