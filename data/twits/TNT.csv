$TNT what is the closing time today?,2021-12-24T18:03:34Z
$TNT I promise you next Christmas we&#39;ll be on the Nasdaq!!!,2021-12-24T16:13:50Z
$TNT why I build positions and stay to diversification is because stuff operates on it&#39;s own timeline. Rule of thumb is keep a 1/4 cash warchest for retractions-- which I&#39;ll be honest so many opportunities this Dec I&#39;ve deployed further than I usually would-- other positions mint profits you take some to the warchest and then spread around to reinforce other positions that have yet to hit targets that you are convicted with. 

This has worked really well for me. I never go all in something but I do go bigger than your joker trading gurus suggest. 

Which is another point--- day and swing trading doesnt make you big money. Position trading with larger timelines on large positions and traditional long term investing does. 

Point is if you&#39;re not trying to hit multiples you arent getting anywhere in a rapid inflation reality. 

I dont care what crybabies say on any position I am in--- they always sell something before true price discovery. 

Happy Holidays fam.,2021-12-24T15:58:17Z
$TNT Who was the person that said the SEC had 15 days to respond from the Nov. 30 (the day PKK allegedly responded to the SEC)? Someone here posted it and should not be trusted going forward.

It‚Äôll happen when it happens but don‚Äôt post false and misleading information.,2021-12-24T15:44:39Z

$TNT Stock market quasi closed today, closed on Monday and Tuesday (in Canada) and closed the following Monday. Leaves us with 3 trading days in 2021. The odds of the SEC doing anything is under 1%. We‚Äôve basically got a pause until Tuesday, January 4. Will the SEC do any work that week? TFSA contribution room increases Jan 1st so we could see some demand to start the year.,2021-12-24T13:13:08Z

$TNT what a joke!,2021-12-23T21:50:13Z
$TNT volume each day seems to hit a new high. Q4 results will be ridiculous. By Feb ‚Äò22, all businesses need to be cleaned up financially per China. 

Everyone it‚Äôs Christmas. Snip some egg nog and get ready to bring in the New Year with a boom!!!,2021-12-23T21:19:54Z

$TNT entire portfolio green today, except this one

Hope those CIBC dickheads are investigated,2021-12-23T18:25:22Z
$TNT it&#39;s all good looks like it may stay depressed for a little while longer allowing me to continually add a % from profits from other positions. Itll all culminate in a fat 5-10X. 

I got time bears.,2021-12-23T18:22:57Z
$TNT shorts are keeping this thing just below $6 .. time will come,2021-12-23T18:11:45Z

$TNT what I like is the past few days the volume seems to be much higher and earlier in the day.  We may be ringing in the New Year with some fireworks!,2021-12-23T17:23:40Z
$TNT I seen this posted somewhere today this is really interesting and a good potential catalyst that could catapult us to amazing heights. February /2022 is just around the corner and all insurance brokers in China need to be on a platform that allows for data sharing. Tenets Heartbeat is the system they are flocking to and joining. This vertical is adding to revenues in 2022.
The new regulations, which were implemented on February 1, 2021, essentially require all insurance brokers to have systems that allow them to share data with, and that are directly linked to, the country‚Äôs insurance companies. As the Heartbeat platform is one of only a handful of platforms that offer such capabilities to the Chinese insurance brokerage industry, insurance brokers, who have until February 1, 2022 to comply with the new regulations or run the risk of having to shut down their operations, have been flocking to the platform. Heartbeat is currently linked to China‚Äôs top insurance companies,2021-12-23T16:59:37Z
