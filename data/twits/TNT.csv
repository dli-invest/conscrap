$TNT Be kind‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm back. Nibbling more. For those constantly looking at the share price _ fruitless activity and a time waster. Accumulate, and walk away. April/May will be great market months. That‚Äôs when I‚Äôll get more active and trading. July/Aug/Sept- time to sell gains. Forecast May shift but not by much. Cheerio. Anything under $4 is great to buy!!! Have a wonderful holiday day.,2022-02-21T20:51:48Z
$TNT Amazing news. Making further acquisitions in China and hopefully soon in North America to compete not only in business lending but personal lending as well.,2022-02-21T18:49:31Z
$TNT All i know is that I am a buyer on Tuesday and ill hit my target. I imagine the SEC has requested additional information and Tenet is dealing with that now. It is what it is. 2021 financials in 5 weeks.  Lots happening behind the scenes.,2022-02-21T17:43:45Z

$TNT anyone on here on the Peak FB group?,2022-02-19T22:42:47Z
$TNT duh Ed I didn‚Äôt say there was anything JJ could do. I said communicate with investors cuz he obviously knows more than u or I.,2022-02-19T18:31:57Z

$TNT I‚Äôm still bullish long term, but I think the CEO should give an update on SEC fiasco. He‚Äôs got to know more detail than the investors n should share with us.,2022-02-19T16:55:35Z
$TNT uh ring ring &quot;hello JJ, I know the SEC is reviewing the registration 40-f but how come you haven&#39;t forced them to move faster than normal?  What do you mean that&#39;s not possible?? Don&#39;t they know the stock price is down??  Oh the SEC doesn&#39;t care and there is nothing you can do?  This is the normal process?? Oh well I guess I&#39;m just and idiot then.  Bye,2022-02-19T16:22:04Z
$TNT Does anybody understand why the sec 30 day rule no longer applies and we have to wait for a response from the sec‚Ä¶ where evidently it applied before?,2022-02-19T14:26:30Z
$TNT when earnings?,2022-02-19T08:21:15Z
$TNT   Well if we are going to go through this SEC delay,  may as well be while the market is shit,2022-02-19T04:32:07Z
$TNT  plain and simple there are no buyers for this stock, outsiders looking in don&#39;t like what they see and after the last 4 months I can see why.,2022-02-19T02:06:42Z
$TNT  Been a crazy year, for sure... But forgive me if I remain optimistic... Remember to water your plants...,2022-02-19T00:32:27Z
$TNT great day!!,2022-02-19T00:11:34Z
$TNT 10th straight down week complete. What a company.,2022-02-18T21:16:37Z
$TNT I have to say after reading Gary Gensler&#39;s (Chairperson of the SEC) Bio on Wikipedia, It humbles me that Tenet is being so thoroughly reviewed under the watch of such a meticulous Chairperson...This is the Chairperson &amp; SEC we want an approval granted under. Whether its this month or not.,2022-02-18T21:09:59Z
$TNT,2022-02-18T17:44:35Z
$TNT what‚Äôs the news today?,2022-02-18T17:03:03Z
$TNT we need capitulation and get all the scared money out first.... hopefully the war will trigger that and we bounce off from there with all strong longs.,2022-02-18T16:47:36Z
