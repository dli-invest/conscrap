$TNT Where&#39;s my T Shirt I need it to dry my eyes.,2022-02-11T23:27:11Z
$TNT does the 30 days timeline to SEC apply to the current filing? and i felt that it&#39;s funny that the market was spook out from the potential raising interest when 5.2 trillion were printed during this covid situation.,2022-02-11T22:14:46Z
$TNT this is so painful. Just duck tape over my eyes so I can‚Äôt see what is going on and it‚Äôs all good.,2022-02-11T21:29:09Z
$TNT  buy when others are fearful....it&#39;s slap city today.,2022-02-11T20:17:56Z

$TNT people shouldn‚Äôt put hope into this stock. The rug pull from the SEC has been going on since September 2020. If you believe this stock can go to $100, then I think you can put your money elsewhere until we hear the all clear from the SEC.,2022-02-11T17:18:38Z
$TNT Increased position by 5% today, last time I bought was probably 7-8 months ago. More cash on sidelines would like to increase by another 5% within next month if possible. Price decline has been frustrating but presents an opportunity to accumulate more shares of companies you have high conviction in.,2022-02-11T17:18:20Z
$TNT Just hold and be rewarded. Buy if possible. This is a proper long term investment. Numbers don&#39;t lie.,2022-02-11T16:52:22Z
$TNT ..I have invested  a fair percentage of my portfolio in PKKFF and I truly believe in this company but i have to say the wait for the SEC to give Nasdaq approval seems to be going on forever and although  i know patience is the key and the rewards will come... i have to say I&#39;m getting so bored...,2022-02-11T15:30:17Z
$TNT Where the fuck is Nasdaq, this just continues to die a slow death.,2022-02-11T14:54:28Z
$TNT Whenever they finally have good uplisting news I expect they&#39;ll PR it on Monday or Tuesday like they did last time,2022-02-11T14:53:44Z
$TNT what‚Äôs the latest here? I‚Äôm bullish long term but don‚Äôt pay attention much because of the whole uplisting flop. Are we close?,2022-02-11T13:30:43Z

$TNT I hope they don‚Äôt get acquired. TNT has the potential to become a multi billion dollar company IMO. I wanna ride the wave.,2022-02-11T01:25:51Z
$TNT at this price Tenet looks like a good acquisition for someone IMO. Great way to get their way in the door in China, what is that worth?,2022-02-11T00:55:42Z
$TNT the week of 21st. Thats all i can disclose.,2022-02-11T00:46:05Z
$TNT I hardly ever stop in here. honest question. will tnt have to get in the same price range that the NASDAQ requires? And if so can I do that organically? Our shares got cut in half last time So I‚Äôm hoping that they ont be the case again.
