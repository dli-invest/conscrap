$TNT People thinking the stock price is going to tank Monday leads me to believe it‚Äôs going to do the exact opposite,2021-11-28T04:04:39Z
Compared to an average Enterprise Value to EBITDA ratio of 31.26, $TNT is valued rather cheaply. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/TNT/fundamental-analysis?key=690bddba-1b63-4685-a193-eb53e75e1267&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=TNT&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2021-11-28T01:14:00Z
$TNT someone on Yahoo was asking how to get into the discord for Tenet. See below:  üëá

$TNT I agree that eyes are on 22 and less on near term catalysts. That is for real price discovery. 14.5 PT are pit stops to 40-50.,2021-11-27T22:54:29Z
$TNT Q4 results that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at. Not the immediate distractions. Nasdaq is inevitable and so is 14.5$,2021-11-27T21:33:46Z
$TNT my friend sent me below (i&#39;m not on discord).... and he said Boss has helped him stay on during the major dips with timely words of conviction.  Much appreciative of what Boss brings.

If anyone knows, Boss knows.,2021-11-27T20:53:31Z
$TNT good to know that the 30 days won‚Äôt start again and won‚Äôt cause a F40 Withdrawal! This means they gotta answer a few questions and they are done so won‚Äôt expect another 30 days probably very fast but it happens when it happens so no expectations,2021-11-27T20:39:35Z
$TNT got an email back from Cathy. She says no to both the 30 days to restart and no to the questions causing a withdrawal of 40F. 

I know some may think they already knew this but I feel any extra assurances are appreciated.,2021-11-27T20:16:41Z
$TNT Reminder that ATH $14.50 was hit pre Nasdaq. Nothing changed. Business is growing and Q4 will be great. Imagine Q4 returning the whole of 2020 revenues! Next year well over $300M. Great. SP completely undervalued compared to fair value 16.5CDN to $109M revenue. That‚Äôs all that matters‚Ä¶SP will catch back up. Relax. And yes it was 50/50 on timing. In the end everyone will be right on Nasdaq and then tsx and HK,2021-11-27T20:12:58Z
$TNT You can‚Äôt white wash the situation by saying ‚Äúknow what you own.‚Äù
That‚Äôs a bunch of baloney, it‚Äôs a big deal getting pushed from the NASDAQ. 
People are going to have concerns and they need to be validated.
It‚Äôs disappointing and annoying and it is what it is, but not holding your shares tight to the vest in my opinion would be a mistake. This is a chance to buy on sale. I‚Äôm more worried about having enough shares than anything else because I truly believe that this is the top stock on my watchlist. For years to come. Cheers ü•Ç,2021-11-27T19:06:03Z
$TNT I don&#39;t get this noise coming from all the forums. I know we all can&#39;t wait for the NASDAQ uplisting to happen, and it&#39;s frustrating that SEC takes a long time. But JJ was clear in the ER that comments from the SEC before the 30 day was a possibility.  All we know that they are working with the SEC, and we are under SEC timeline. I look forward to when the process is finished and to see TNT on the NASDAQ once again. 

The focus should only be on the business. We are still waiting to hear how much revenue was generated from Singles day. The guidance haven&#39;t changed. These are the things that will matter in the end. The future looks bright and i&#39;m damn excited about it.,2021-11-27T18:01:03Z

‚ÄúWe are working on the process to uplist to the NASDAQ, and will let you know when that is approved.‚Äù,2021-11-27T16:36:43Z
$TNT this is starting to reek of scam. Couple days before the nasdaq listing debacle ends and the SEC needs MORE information. How convenient.,2021-11-27T15:56:28Z
$TNT,2021-11-27T14:54:37Z
$TNT SEC is currently doing what it needs to do so we just need to let it play out!  JJ did say by the end of Q4 (that was his official communication) but I was optimistic of it getting uplisted by late next week.  Fundamentals are on our side with real revenue and significant growth forecasted in new verticals.  Still long and haven‚Äôt sold one share or warrant - my conviction has not waivered! üß® GLTA,2021-11-27T14:35:17Z

$TNT: The Revenue has grown by 261.24% in the past year. This is a very strong growth! https://www.chartmill.com/stock/analyzer/stock/TNT?view=fundamental-analysis&amp;key=690bddba-1b63-4685-a193-eb53e75e1267&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=TNT&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2021-11-27T13:20:00Z

$TNT &lt;sigh&gt;    Probably why JJ said he expects to be re listed by year end just in case the SEC wants any more info.  Fine.

  Eyes on 2022 anyways. Revenue/earnings will drive this stock once this is in the rear view mirror and we are finally on the Nasdaq ,   also the TSX and Hong Kong for some much needed diversity in exchanges.

 As annoying as it is there isn&#39;t anything different about the execution and growth of the company.   Anyone who has done the research knows how well Tenet is positioned.

 No debt. Earnings positive. Enough cash on hand to cover expansion and completely set up all the verticals through to 2023 as per JJ.  Amazing growth already and even more amazing growth for 2022 as per the guidance.

    &quot;no pain no gain&quot;  (that is if you let the day to day fog out the month to year),2021-11-27T06:30:53Z

$TNT Do we really want to be up-listed into this freaked out market? Just saying.,2021-11-27T02:48:55Z
$TNT Here is what I received from Barry. And it is in line with what JJ said during the earnings call. By end of year listed on Nasdaq. 
‚ÄúThe SEC came back with a few questions on Wednesday, minor ones. We plan on submitting the answers on Monday and we expect to see a quick turn around from their side. After that, a request for an accelerated relisting on Nasdaq.‚Äù,2021-11-27T02:13:55Z
$TNT,2021-11-27T02:05:27Z
Based on estimates for the next 5 years, $TNT will show a quite strong growth in EPS: 19.87% on average per year. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/TNT/fundamental-analysis?key=690bddba-1b63-4685-a193-eb53e75e1267&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=TNT&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2021-11-27T02:03:00Z

$TNT Barry should have to put up his hand if he wants to take a piss, email or talk about Tenet,2021-11-27T01:27:08Z
$TNT Weak people here. People like @GreenLIFE are the ones who constantly pump and give fake dates to everyone.. read his posts here and on Yahoo.......just ignore the noise... Everyone just relax... and all will be well. Focus on Fundamentals ! Nasdaq will happen...,2021-11-27T00:52:59Z
$TNT The time for panic was a month or two ago people. Relax. Stay in the damn car.,2021-11-27T00:43:52Z
$TNT Hate to say I told you so but I told you so, the perma bull hype artists once again were spamming their fake deadlines saying everything will be done by the 27th. Someday when you get out of highschool and go into the real world youll realize things never go in a straight line. You have been wrong at least 2 times trying to predict the relist. Word of advice stop trying to predict deadlines when dealing with the government. 
  I am BEARISH AF on this stock until they figure their shit out, Nasdaq and ER(not even letting investors know when its being released) have proven this company to be an absolute shit show. You bulls better pray Q4 is good or yall are fucked. Enjoy the weekend!,2021-11-27T00:19:47Z
