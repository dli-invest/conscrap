$TNT the one thing that is concerning me is how fast it’s breaking through all these support levels, the stock price stayed between $5-$6 per share from Jan. 2021 - May 2021 before it dropped below $5 briefly and then rebounded to ATH’s we just smashed through the $5 range in less than a month and looks like we are on our way to $3 now even faster, any insight from the investors who’ve been here a lot longer than me? Honest question not trying to stir the pot,2022-02-15T04:02:56Z

$TNT paid pumpers 👇🏽👇🏽,2022-02-14T23:21:02Z
$TNT  i&#39;ve been nibbling a few thousand shares each day....... that&#39;s the only way to play this because when it comes, it&#39;ll come out of nowhere.  ... could be tomorrow, or next week. No one knows,2022-02-14T21:53:48Z
$TNT added again several times today. Didn&#39;t get the low but super happy to add at these bargain basement levels. Might add more this week,2022-02-14T21:53:34Z

$TNT oops I did add again. I really did try to contain myself, but just couldn´t resist...,2022-02-14T20:58:51Z
$TNT one thing I’ll admit I did wrong. No matter how good the opportunity is never put all your eggs in one basket. Lesson learned!,2022-02-14T20:39:18Z
$TNT Curious - would anyone here keep their money invested in the worst investment of their life or sell and move on? Asking for a friend.,2022-02-14T20:27:07Z
$TNT It’s human psychology, this is why retail traders feel like they never win, bc the hedge funds nudges the stocks down 5-10 percent and every dumb “investor” panic sells and gets fleeced, while the hedgies pick up 10 dollar stocks for 7 and etc etc, we have such strong fundamentals you’d have be a sucker to sell at these prices? lol? The funny thing is, the lower it goes, the less risky it is, yet there are more FUD being spread the lower it goes, go against the grain and you can beat the market.,2022-02-14T20:22:50Z
$TNT low vol. calm down. Big week next week!,2022-02-14T20:04:33Z
$TNT So good info👍🏻,2022-02-14T20:02:33Z
$TNT Real companies with “great fundamentals” don’t drop for 10 weeks straight and 8% in a day for absolutely no reason. I wonder what the people selling known that retail doesn’t. Worst trade Iv made in 15 years.,2022-02-14T19:54:30Z
$TNT total annihilation. This will break the $3 mark on the US side and $4 on CAD side. Only Q4 earnings can save this company at this,2022-02-14T19:52:31Z
$TNT Probably will be in the high 1s end of week.,2022-02-14T19:30:04Z
$TNT This is a company that has started trading on NASDAQ today. They have made around 15 amendments before they listed today. Average time per amendment is 1 month and a half. https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0001450704,2022-02-14T18:14:45Z
$TNT hahaha garbage stock. I been saying this since they got delisted. Dumb dogs. $4 incoming,2022-02-14T18:01:12Z
$TNT this is unbelievable, I love the company but damn this stock sucks 😂 hopefully the reversal will be worth the patience.. until then, how low can she go? No support 🙈,2022-02-14T17:28:44Z
$TNT accumulated another shares.. never expected we would see these levels again,2022-02-14T16:58:41Z
$TNT the daily share price may be hard to stomach for those not use to seeing red days after red days..... it&#39;s gut check time boys, only the strong survives.,2022-02-14T16:28:18Z
$TNT thank God we have those fundamentals,2022-02-14T15:55:09Z
$TNT this is the worst,2022-02-14T15:33:59Z
$TNT I have to give credit to the longs here for holding through this fiasco down to these levels which is now sub pre R/S.,2022-02-14T15:31:29Z
$TNT Curious to figure out if insiders have sold the last few trading days. Anyone know this answer?,2022-02-14T15:26:01Z
$TNT come to papa...  Will wait for afternoon for some more tasty treats.,2022-02-14T15:25:14Z
$TNT Desperate people will do anything to get their propaganda out.  For example saying we are down on a green day.,2022-02-14T15:04:51Z
$TNT Tanking on a Green Day as people bail out as fast as they can. On its way to its 10th straight red week. What a shit show.,2022-02-14T14:57:57Z
$TNT Is the stock seriously going to struggle holding in the 4s now? Ridiculous to even be in the 4s but to continue to go down each day on no news is even sadder.,2022-02-14T14:34:49Z
