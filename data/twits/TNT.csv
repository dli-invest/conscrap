$TNT So exciting as it trades in a range slowly dropping and just enough of Green Day‚Äôs to keep you hooked in. Sounds familiar. I‚Äôll get my further fill at $5-$6 thanks.,2021-12-31T23:52:43Z

Singles Day: $7.8 million

12/12: $9.9 million

Tenet had $25.6 million revenue last quarter with no special shopping events. 

Looks like we&#39;re going to beat Q4 estimates,2021-12-31T22:33:50Z
$TNT I‚Äôve seen this a few times in the last 2 months. Just the rumour of a Nasdaq re-listing shot the SP up over a dollar. I‚Äôm just patiently waiting.,2021-12-31T21:51:03Z

$TNT 

Good morning/Good afternoon to everyone on the TNT stocktwits page. 

I have recently purchased my 5000th TNT share today and have been holding from my initial buy at $7.50USD while adding on the way down. 

I wrote out a 1000 word post prior to this post but accidentally lost it so I will summarize my thoughts briefly:

I have been following this stocktwits page since mid September before purchasing shares and have seen my fair share of good content (RooksL) and bad (investorguru), not to mention a symbolic office water cooler filled with kool-aid.

Tenet has been sketching me out a bit with this horrible IR-the grammar from Kathy and Barry is weak for a professional company 2 say the least (and I am no shining star). The one thing I will say is that when you have 100 flags and 94 of them are green-the red flags stick out much easier compared to a sea of 61 green flags and 39 red flags. 

3/4 largest oil companies? Cmon boys. Bullhorns. Not perma-bullhorns. Healthy skepticism.,2021-12-31T19:09:11Z

$TNT Happy New Year All.  

I recognize that the past few months have been disappointing with the SP decline and many complain about the company, the CEO, etc.  From my point of view, the company and leadership have executed extremely well but yes a few mistakes have certainly delayed some progress.  The SEC delays are a completely different story and no matter what, we would still face this scrutiny with Gensler rule changes - many Nasdaq companies with heavy Chinese operations will experience the same pain soon enough.  

Remember Tenet was a micro cap stock not long ago and our fundamentals are clearly proving the path forward will be great!  This journey requires patience, but I do respect those that need to move on.

If your conviction is all but gone, I would suggest maybe moving on to other well known companies that have been beat up over the past months like us, such as:  UPST, STNE, ZM, or PYPL 

GLTA - Stay safe and well. üß®üß®üß®üß®,2021-12-31T16:16:28Z

$TNT Fundamentals keep getting stronger in the background while trolls will keep whining about share price and a delay out of Tenets control.  The deeper they push this down with FUD and manipulation the harder it will pop when we get clarity. I have seen no logical reason the SEC will not make Tenet&#39;s 40f effective. Not one troll has a shred of evidence otherwise.,2021-12-31T15:50:13Z

$TNT funny how so many ‚Äúinvestors‚Äù here do not even read the form 40f filing. They already disclosed everything in the SEC letter. Expecting relist soon.,2021-12-31T07:55:28Z
$TNT truth is the the FUDsters kryptonite.   The business will still grow 140% this year even with the delay.   SEC will be done it&#39;s review soon.  None of this is Tenet specific.   They are obviously in the middle of regulatory changes which is causing this process to take longer than it otherwise would.,2021-12-31T06:20:00Z

$TNT There is a limit to the amount of cool-aid one should drink before you getting in too deep. I am a long, don&#39;t short and don&#39;t rely on stop losses. But JJ and his team are rookies at best when it comes to the all important SEC filings. Smart experienced leaders know and anticipate roadblocks in advance and plan and execute on them before they become this big of a problem. I am not impressed with these chumps especially when I look at the financial bath I have taken after listening to the hype here. I&#39;ll pass on the T shirt, just get your act together JJ. I am really tired of the antics. I hope all the revenues you are posting stand up to the audit you might be facing cause right now your cred is Zero.,2021-12-31T04:51:17Z
$TNT so the SEC basically said, we don‚Äôt have any direct questions or comments but read over this new registration guidance that was released a week ago, do our job for us, and make sure we didn‚Äôt miss anything, SEC is even more pathetic than I thought! Didn‚Äôt think it was possible.. good news is, how about those 12/12 numbers? Way bigger than I expected, 40-50milion Q4 revenues pretty much guaranteed üçª TNT will hit new ATH‚Äôs this year only a matter of time,2021-12-31T04:47:34Z
$TNT I&#39;m going to email Barry and tell him that the t shirts need to be revised. I want mine to say &quot;I held through the great SEC FUD&quot; üí™ lol,2021-12-31T02:19:07Z

$TNT I&#39;m kind of wishing Tenet will be a smart ass and amend the risk disclosure to add in really big bold letters at the top:
