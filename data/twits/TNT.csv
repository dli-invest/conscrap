Join us!! Love to hear thoughts on Tenet!

$TNT Ok well it was worth a try but I‚Äôm happy to report that I‚Äôm back with my TNT Fam here and I avg out through out the day. For those on here that are in Fobi I still wish you well and really all that matters is that someone amongst us makes money and that the shorts burn üî•! Lol üòÇ Merry Christmas! üéÑ,2021-12-17T20:20:05Z

$TNT this stocks price is dead until we inevitably get back on NASDAQ. Everyone that believes should be buying in now. Question is will it drop lower before NASDAQ happens?,2021-12-17T19:46:20Z
$TNT I‚Äôm out for the holidays, no need to let this slow bleed ü©∏ kill my egg nog induced buzz. NASDQ for the NY? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Happy Holidays to all!,2021-12-17T19:44:15Z
$TNT  Wtf is Tenet doing associating themselves with such an obvious stock pumping site like Stockfam??  Those goofs look like giddy cheerleaders talking to Johnson in interviews.,2021-12-17T19:39:51Z

$TNT If you haven&#39;t already blocked @Porkysabe  and @Johnny_Geezy I&#39;d recommend doing so and avoid wasting precious time trying to use logic with people who are shorts/fake bulls or are not actually invested and just get a messed up thrill in being divisive on boards.,2021-12-17T16:21:37Z
$TNT  nothing good ever happens here.,2021-12-17T16:03:35Z
$TNT The shorts covered as soon as they saw that amended 40-F had been posted on the SEC website. Then once they saw that it would take another few weeks to actually be listed, they trickled back into their short position. Is this hard to see? If you don&#39;t have the patience to ride the difficult waves, sell to the smart money that will. ü§∑,2021-12-17T15:14:22Z
$TNT Slow bleed. Psychological warfare.,2021-12-17T14:36:59Z
$TNT  Love that Tenet is always evolving.  The business hub offers a complete range of services to it&#39;s clients as if revolutionary  SME loan matching wasn&#39;t enough.  As we all knew before the data end of that core service would add an Immense form of revenue, it doesn&#39;t end there folks.

 The Redbull deal is more based on the supply chain / financial end (data is always an element as well)  where as this new coffee addition to the PetroChina relationship is more on the point of sale end (thus far).

  Point of sale, remember that?  If I&#39;m not mistaken companies like Lightspeed make a fortune doing just that alone.

  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Tenet&#39;s subsidiaries provide various analytics and AI based services to financial institutions and businesses through the Business Hub‚Ñ¢, an ecosystem where data analysis and artificial intelligence are used to facilitate transactions among its members.,2021-12-17T10:00:19Z

$TNT I know it goes down on absolutely no volume, but the same principle works the other way as well.  It would be nice to see even a minuscule amount of buying to push this up and hold a gain once in awhile.,2021-12-16T22:03:36Z
$FOBIF $TNT Ok so I‚Äôm sticking my neck out and letting you guys know that in the last 15mins I took 29k from Tenet and moved into  Fobi for a one day play. Hopefully this doesn‚Äôt end up being the day when TNT shoots up on SEC approval and Fobis AGM ends up being a snoozer. Just sharing that‚Äôs all. (If TNT gets approval can I do a collection plate?) üòÇ üò≠,2021-12-16T21:28:53Z

$TNT  Sure hope something good happens fast - 30th is creeping up to tempt even the true believers with tax loss harvesting. Been in for two years and not selling, and in fact wish I could buy more, so no jibber jabber ;),2021-12-16T21:19:23Z
