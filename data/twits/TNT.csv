$TNT I mean $11.3mm EBITA. this early. I‚Äôm all in. They have great growth potential. They are basically printing money this early. I actually wish they would take on some cheap debt and leverage for growth.,2021-11-16T04:56:25Z
$TNT According to Simply Wall St. Tenet is worth $27.12 CDN on future cash flow. And according to Zack‚Äôs research it‚Äôs worth over $16 CDN when the report was written, which was on the lower previous guidance.,2021-11-16T04:49:23Z
$TNT From the MD&amp;A: ‚Äúthe Company used the quarter as a springboard for future growth, much the same way events that took place in Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 combined to take the Company‚Äôs revenue to new heights.‚Äù When they revised guidance, they already knew what Q3 was and just had to forecast Q4‚Ä¶so yes they WILL hit guidance and May surpass it. And look at the great operating results. Making money at this early stage! That‚Äôs what Wall Street will be evaluating too. Fantastic performance. And if you‚Äôve been in business before, yes you will have great growth (less sometimes than what you wanted), but sets the stage for the next quarter and future business.,2021-11-16T04:32:19Z
$TNT   As I predicted this quarter would be the lower of the  Q3 and Q4 with Q4 being as much as 40 mill rev and as much as 4 mill earnings.  Oh and by the way Tenet isn&#39;t carrying any debt.

   Maybe the noobies who have no clue about things like positive earnings and EBITDA  think it was a poor quarter?   I said a couple days ago this quarter is all about these numbers.

  Next year is where you will see the massive jumps with guidance in the 80&#39;s per quarter average AND the crazy earnings spikes to boot.

  As for so called &quot;pumping&quot; ,  ha ha ,  I hope the noobs sell, sell and sell some more, don&#39;t need ya, don&#39;t want ya.  Weak hands build weak support levels.  

  Why learn about how owning stock in a company works and what to look for when you can go to guys like StockGuru jr for financial advice, they will help you to sell this trash.,2021-11-16T04:32:14Z
$TNT Can someone comment on the 618 Shopping festival and why the company says that impacted results. Seems like  if that was factored in then the number could have been closer to 3Omillion. Any validity?,2021-11-16T04:20:33Z
$TNT after all that FUD TNT proves again what a solid company its growing into.  
                    REV             EBITDA        Profit

$TNT Well the good news about the NASDAW is technically November 27th or any day after is ‚Äúend of the quarter‚Äù.. Nov 27th is definitely not mid and sure as hell not  the beginning. 

The numbers were decent. Nothing to flash investors and get them to flock to it, IMO. I could see this being red all week, or even until we hit Nasdaq or more PRs. To get some positive sentiment they needed to have crushed numbers. Currently the delisting has left a giant stain and management has yet to go on their knees to clean it up.

The limbo period sucks - everyone waiting on NASDAQ with no news from SEC and management being super quiet. The stock will continue to be beat around until then.

As bullish and as long as I am, I cannot realistically see this being $20 - $25 EOY from previous estimates. Maybe $15 CAD max if that. I can see it hitting its old PR before people take profits and it drops again. Maybe $20-$25 by Q1 2022.,2021-11-16T04:02:25Z
$TNT  they already knew q3 revenue when they did the revised guidance.,2021-11-16T03:45:21Z
$TNT GL with $40m Q4, it aint happening,2021-11-16T03:41:39Z
$TNT I would not be shocked if they lower guidance.,2021-11-16T03:25:31Z
$TNT from beets on discord: Love this,‚Ä¶.

50% of the company&#39;s  revenues are expected to come from outside China by 2024. Current guidance is for over 800M in revenues (just China) in 2023. These numbers are absolutely mind-blowing.,2021-11-16T03:20:25Z

$TNT 
From the MD&amp;A Q3 2021

&quot;On the capital markets front, the Company will look to have its securities listed on a senior stock 
exchange in Canada as soon as practicable and expects to have met the new guidance provided 
by the SEC to allow for its common shares to resume trading on the Nasdaq by the end of the 
quarter. This would enable the Company to resume the preparation of a short form base shelf 
prospectus in collaboration with an investment banking syndicate, headed by The Benchmark 
Company, to raise the capital the Company estimates would be required to establish its network of 
Business Hubs in various countries around the globe over the next few years.&quot;,2021-11-16T03:01:39Z
$TNT Do yourself a favor and calculate the EBITDA margin from Q1 2021 to Q3 2021 to get an idea of how this is trending. Large growth in margins and profitability will attract investors and drive share price  more than anything (and of course business 101 you want to own something that makes money eventually). JJ has stated improving of margins over the next few years will happen with lowering of outsourced cost of revenue , and we see it happening. These are the important QoQ trends to examine as a long term investor (and of course revenue growth).  Company also states 50% of revenue will come from outside of China by 2024, which is very exciting and they are already in talks with a few institutions over financing to fuel global expansion as a result of Nasdaq uplist. Pay attention to the QoQ and YoY rather than the day to day noise.,2021-11-16T02:54:50Z
$TNT Now I want you all to really think about this. These numbers were already known when they released the updated guidance. And what was the updated guidance? 

-109 million in revenue for the year
-$4.4 million net income

What do we have so far?

-$70 million in revenue
-$1.8 million net income

This means that Tenet management is predicting we will make:
-$39 million in revenue and
-$2.6 million in net income for Q4

We&#39;ll have a clearer picture tomorrow during/after the earnings call. I&#39;m already seeing some chatter about lower prices tomorrow, but good fortune favors the bold. I&#39;ll be buying any dips. Get the chips.,2021-11-16T02:42:22Z
$TNT they are forecasting $38.4M for Q4 based on latest guidance ‚Äî setting up for a big beat!,2021-11-16T02:41:01Z

$TNT Revenue is in line with guidance. Revenue is nothing to get excited about but nothing to fret over either.  Now that net profit, that looks juicy.,2021-11-16T02:18:50Z

$TNT I still think that the earnings can come out late at night, like we&#39;ve seen in the past where it gets released 11PM. I wouldn&#39;t discount Barry&#39;s email to @SAKDOS yet.,2021-11-16T01:34:31Z
