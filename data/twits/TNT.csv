$TNT chartmil what is this garbage. So dumb,2021-09-18T03:14:08Z
$TNT investors are very lucky to be here at the bottom. Couple years and you can retire on this 

$UPST looks amazing, too - TNT will be here in a couple years. Go check out their revenues üëç‚¨ÜÔ∏è,2021-09-18T02:54:35Z

$TNT with watchers and investors growing here at a robust clip, here is a Discord group (StockFam) that has done extensive due diligence and has ongoing analysis about Peak/TNT. Once you are in, scroll down to Peak Fintech (general). It‚Äôs free, and all I want out of it is for investors here to be educated about the fundamentals and unique (rare) opportunity that this is. Think UPST, but B2B even stickier.

The technical rating of $TNT is bad and it also does not present a quality setup at the moment. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/analyzer/stock/TNT?key=690bddba-1b63-4685-a193-eb53e75e1267&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=TA&amp;utm_content=TNT&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2021-09-18T00:13:00Z

$TNT looking forward to JJ&#39;s updated revs! Should be epic, imo.,2021-09-17T23:54:23Z
$TNT 
It‚Äôs been a crazy week here. I think we have many more crazy weeks to come. The road to $100 is going to be bumpy as fuck! We‚Äôre gonna see big swings up and big swings down. If that‚Äôs not something you can handle, and you‚Äôve already made some decent profits..... Maybe you should consider selling now before it drops hard and you do something stupid like sell for a loss because you think it‚Äôs just crashing. Oh well what do I know anyway? That‚Äôs just my 2 cents. You can take it or leave it.,2021-09-17T23:26:40Z
$TNT wow some finish . good,2021-09-17T22:25:51Z

$TNT I haven&#39;t blocked a single &quot;bearish&quot; poster.

With that fact established, only one has posted in the last 24 hours. Two in the past 48. 

There was a short attack, they dropped it to $8, but it bounced right back. You can say that it failed.

Based on what I saw on this board over the last two weeks, along with the price action we just witnessed, imo the theory that there are FUD creators on these boards that are paid bashers, is real. They tried to sow FUD in the weeks prior then came with the short attack, trying to hit real or mental stop losses. It appears they failed. I hope they lost money on this venture anyway.,2021-09-17T21:24:52Z

$TNT This stock is too strong, if the shorts haven&#39;t been shaken out over these past two days then they will by next week. There are much better shorting opportunities than TNT,2021-09-17T19:33:06Z
