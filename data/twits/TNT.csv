$TNT I have had a position of varying size in this company since Sep 2021.  I finally went through 40F.  I was alarmed when I came across this statement - &quot;Moreover, our auditors, Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton LLP (&quot;GT Canada&quot;), have stated that there is significant doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments to contractors, service providers and merchants will depend on our future financial performance, which will be affected by a range of economic, competitive, regulatory, legislative and business factors, many of which are outside of our control.&quot;  Any educated comments from the gallery on this?,2022-01-15T04:10:29Z
$TNT With respect to the SEC processing time, below is a list of known timeline:
TNT submits 40-F   2021-10-27
SEC first comments  2021-11-24 (+28 days)
TNT submits 40-F amendment 2021-12-7 (+13 days)
SEC second comments 2021-12-28 (+21 days)
TNT submits response letter 2022-1-12 (+15 days)
According to this 2013 statistics https://www.wilmerhale.com/en/insights/blogs/the-road-to-ipo-legal-and-regulatory-insights-into-going-public/how-quickly-does-the-sec-staff-review-a-form-s-1-updated-data , and considering some delays caused by the holiday season and SEC new guideline that came out on 12-22-2021, I think we are perfectly within the normal SEC processing time.

As JJ stated in the interview, so far there is no indication that SEC won&#39;t make the registration effective. And personally I think we are getting very close. According to the 2013 link, we can expect SEC feedback on the response letter in a median of 12 days starting from 2022-1-12.,2022-01-14T21:40:38Z

$TNT volume to the upside for a Friday looking terrific. Insider buying, ball back in SEC court for uplist and saw quite a few larger buys today on the tape. More insider buying?,2022-01-14T17:48:58Z
$TNT it honestly really pisses me the fuck off that this SEC bullshit caused months of bleeding. I bought a bulk of my shares at $9 right before the Nasdaq listing. Just for it to drop over 50% in value. 

I could have had double the fucking shares right now. Unbelievably annoying,2022-01-14T17:27:03Z

$TNT,2022-01-14T16:23:01Z
$TNT Short term thinking says we need Nasdaq as the next step forward for business growth, in fact Tenet has been running all along with precise execution and expanding far beyond my wildest dreams with deals with major international firms and no need for immediate capital injections.  As clearly stated by JJ in his last interview,Nasdaq is just one of many ways to access capital markets.  The Hong Kong exchange will create a feeding frenzy for Tenet stock and this has me excited more than any other exchange.  Bullish all day long!!!,2022-01-14T16:16:11Z
$TNT If you&#39;ve studied Tenet&#39;s price chart and news releases it&#39;s unavoidable to notice the major price swings higher or lower right before significant news is released. This is one of the flaws of this company: I think someone is running their mouth before they tell the general populace. You may think I&#39;m over thinking, and I&#39;ll admit I could be wrong, it&#39;s just an assumption.

My betting money is that Tenet replied back to the SEC saying &quot;We&#39;re confident we&#39;ve already complied with your risk disclosure&quot;.  Which, if so, would be a great thing. If the lawyers believe that they can offer nothing more in the way of disclosure, then they&#39;re also confident that the SEC is out of obstruction ammunition and has to let us through.

Again, all just pure speculation/opinion and you know what they say about opinions.,2022-01-14T16:07:41Z
$TNT to all those who have been here through the ups and downs. Good luck on the other side of this. Enjoy your lambos and new homes. No memes, just reality of the situation. The horizon approaches,2022-01-14T15:59:23Z
