$TNT 

One thing I&#39;m confident about: The people who were long Tenet that could possibly get spooked about the NASDAQ issue SOLD a long time ago.  
 
I keep silently chuckling to myself every time I see someone say &quot;I&#39;m keeping some money to the side just in case we aren&#39;t listed by the 30 day period.&quot; 
 
LMAO are you kidding me? Where have you been the last two months? These current Tenet longs are battle hardened storm troopers.  
 
Guys, anyone who could possibly get shook out of their shares left by now in my opinion, and I haven&#39;t seen any large volume recently that would indicate we have had an influx of new guys waiting on the NASDAQ uplist lol.,2021-11-24T03:03:05Z
$TNT I have said that we need to aim for re-listing on Nasdaq by end of year. However, I received a response from Barry today. He said No additional requests from SEC to date since the re-submission of clarifications. Expecting communication from SEC by/on Monday 29th. And once notified, Nasdaq would take a couple of days to re-list.,2021-11-24T02:45:33Z

$TNT classaction.org shows there is not a single suit filed against Peak/Tenet. These sham law firms can write what they want on their website but there is no merit to it.,2021-11-23T23:23:33Z
$TNT averaged down again,2021-11-23T22:31:08Z
$TNT  here&#39;s some food for thought, 42% of the trades today were between CIBC and Anonymous, CIBC to CIBC, or Anon to Anon.

CIBC broker bought the most shares today at approx. 121k shares.

CIBC was selling into the ASK all morning (To anonymous)

Anonymous was dumping late into the afternoon, mostly to CIBC.  

Right hand selling to left hand? Thoughts?.,2021-11-23T22:01:50Z
$TNT --&gt; As of 4:30pm, Tenet&#39;s Form-40 remains filed. Has not been amended, withdrawn nor pulled. The SEC has effectively one more day to comment. Possible, yes. Likely, no.,2021-11-23T21:35:26Z

$TNT If you&#39;re long Tenet and stressing over the decline you have to ask yourself &quot;If I encountered this stock for the first time today, would I buy it?&quot; I would. At this moment it not only looks like a great investment long term, it also looks good as a 3-month swing trade. I envy the guys who still have money to buy more. I bought and bought and bought until I&#39;m out. But it&#39;s no big deal. In three months when we knock it out with better earnings I may shave off alittle. But this is a good long term hold as well as a good swing at current levels. Just saying.,2021-11-23T19:17:42Z
$TNT Friendly reminder daily  share price movements are irrelevant; they mean nothing on low volume (or in many cases on any volume). 

1) Share price tracks earnings over long term; Management is growing earnings , thus the longer we remain down here , the faster we move up later (since share price tracks earnings). 

2) Management doesn‚Äôt need to raise any capital to fund their growth plans until after 2022, maybe even well into 2023, thus from a capital market standpoint, share price doesn‚Äôt matter.

Imagine some kids trading some Pok√©mon cards in a parking lot somewhere , and then basing the worldwide price and global supply and demand on what those kids in the parking lot traded the cards for. That‚Äôs Tenet right now.,2021-11-23T18:38:32Z
