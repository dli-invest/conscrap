$TNT think of Tenet like a time capsule; if you look at it everyday it&#39;s pointless, but if you hold it and wait... then it all makes sense in the end! Just hold and wait people,2022-02-18T01:39:44Z
$TNT $9 EOY,2022-02-18T00:53:26Z

$TNT Russia/Ukraine fiasco, runaway inflation, Fed aggressively seeking to raise rates, incompetent leadership in Washington, and of course the ridiculous SEC process. For the love of God, I hope they don‚Äôt come back and ask for more. This is a temporary mess.,2022-02-17T20:32:18Z

$TNT welp.... i guess it&#39;s time to nibble a few thousand shares again.  Come to papa.,2022-02-17T18:18:45Z
$TNT I‚Äôm still holding only because the pumpers convinced me not to sell at $9. But I‚Äôm a grown man and must accept my fate now. Gonna hold for 3-5 years anyways. We‚Äôll make it thru,2022-02-17T17:49:33Z

$TNT Number 1‚Ä¶.The Twitter people need to block anybody with a negative comment so that they cannot see the Twitter feed. ( Social media protocols.) Number 2‚Ä¶Do not engage.,2022-02-17T15:50:42Z
$TNT sweet baby Jesus $3.90 support., well hopefully this is where we start going the other way GLTA üçª,2022-02-17T15:49:03Z

$TNT At what point does the cratering SP become an issue to the people with blinders on and their fingers ears?  
 
JoJohn said himself not being on NASDAQ will hurt the companies ability to raise money, if they have to issue shares when this is a penny stock again its going to dilute the fuck out of everyone&#39;s shares.,2022-02-17T14:47:38Z
$TNT Man I hate to say it, but it would be great if the low share price shakes out a lot of these &quot;investors&quot;. I just checked the company&#39;s twitter and every post has one of these bozos attempting to callout management or the NASDAQ situation. 
 
Do people not realize this is a start-up company tied to a product? If you truly want Tenet to succeed the last thing you should be doing is spreading FUD on all of their social media engagement. If I am one of these SMEs interested in using Tenet and decide to do a quick google search and see nothing but negative comments and chaos,  do you think that would encourage me to adopt their systems? You&#39;re starting to see this same nonsense on LinkedIn as well. It&#39;s just dumb, especially if you&#39;re invested in the company, you&#39;re just trashing your own brand and image. Leave all the frustration and venting to boards like this or yahoo. 
 
The worst part is these people probably have like 500 shares  and feel entitled to a direct line to JJ.,2022-02-17T14:47:32Z
