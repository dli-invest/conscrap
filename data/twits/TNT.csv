$TNT ; For anyone reading. Patience is the name of the game. The stock market is the transfer of the wealth from the inpatient to the patient and the uneducated to the educated. We are holding a stock that in their early stages are performing like a large cap company. Rapidly growing YoY / QoQ revenues, in an emerging sector and most importantly at least for me PROFITABLE.,2021-11-04T20:43:56Z

$TNT Off work today. Very bored.

Looking at the chart. The highest the 20 day moving average got was $9.23 on the PKKFF USD side. 

Hopefully most investors have been able to cost average their way to a better position.,2021-11-04T18:48:04Z
$TNT Just saying… I am not worried, I know what I have invested in ..everything will get sorted out but I do believe JJ should get out in front of this and address this, after all that’s what the company is known for! Transparency. 
And ignoring it on Discord it’s just silly IMO,2021-11-04T18:27:59Z

$TNT E*Trade showing that Tenet&#39;s share price did a few zig zags and U-turn&#39;s apparently,2021-11-04T14:56:13Z
$TNT Seems like a lot of uncertainty whether the SEC will approve TNT on the NASDAQ everyday that goes by. 

I won’t lie, I’m confident they will but they made it seem like they were constantly in contact with the SEC and had only a couple minor wrinkles to flatten out. I thought for sure a couple days max. I guess the workers at the SEC are like the workers at the CRA here - fat, old, poor and lazy.,2021-11-04T14:47:52Z
$TNT It took around 4 months to close the PP back in July. There were a lot of negativity during that time frame and  the stock went from $3.10&#39;s to 1.88(Presplit). Some people panicked and sold but I kept on adding on every dip and I took that as an opportunity to double my position from what I had initially. The stock went up 250% to its all time high once it was resolved. I still have increased my warrant&#39;s position during the Short report panic. All these dips paid me off and I&#39;m sitting with a good gain. Patience is the key if you believe in the company and know what you own. I&#39;m sure JJ will not disappoint it&#39;s share holders.,2021-11-04T14:47:20Z
