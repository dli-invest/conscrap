$TNT getting back on the nasdaq will give us a bump but it will be the 20 or so new releases thats been held back, but coming, which will take us to new highs.
 
&quot;Everything is coming together&quot; according to Cathy means Nov and Dec will be fun here 

Nov 1 starts with the rebranding as Tenet, relisting after will open the floodgates for NR&#39;s,2021-10-29T04:23:26Z
$TNT Just wanted to say that I‚Äôll look back on these days fondly when it was just a board of 20 or so distinctive characters.  Something tells me those days are numbered‚Ä¶,2021-10-28T23:04:13Z

$TNT PKK finds one and PKKFF loses one.. all good,2021-10-28T20:20:13Z
$TNT it‚Äôs amazing to me that folks still haven‚Äôt found this one, and the very rare opportunity to get in at the ground level. Trading officially on the Nasdaq next week  with the green light from the SEC will go a long ways towards changing that. Also, Q3 earnings will open a lot of eyes. Soon, the institutional $ will take this one over and Retail will be buying much higher. While UPST is different and a great company, I think TNT has even more upside with their B2B model and having the China market in their back pocket.,2021-10-28T20:10:38Z

$TNT Someone should make a post that Peak has revealed in their amended 40-F they intend to sell one of their subsidiaries, ASFC. I&#39;m sure there are a significant amount of people who have blocked me who would like to know that. Just do me a favor and give credit where credit is due in regard to me reading over the 40-F and seeing and reporting this info. first. 

I&#39;ll make my intentions clear:  I&#39;d like to show those who blocked me that I contribute to the board, and they&#39;ve made a mistake. It may sound petty, but if you ever have to go through the experience of reading bits and pieces of conversations on a board, you&#39;ll understand my frustration.,2021-10-28T00:39:28Z
