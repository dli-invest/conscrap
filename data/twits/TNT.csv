$TNT For the Canadian operation, I am eyeing mid Q1 2022. There are tons of works that need to be done before we can have a successful launch - Securing partners, UI/UX and software development, branding, marketing, etc.

It is important to do it right rather than launching in a rush.,2021-12-08T05:46:24Z
$TNT I&#39;ll be very surprised if these are still on the Ask
at this price in the morning.,2021-12-08T05:41:24Z
$TNT so I guess PetroChina and Tenet is not just about Redbull distribution ...... if you know then you know.  Kaboom.,2021-12-08T04:30:49Z
$TNT but who in the right mind would sell a share right now ?,2021-12-08T04:21:09Z
The technical rating of $TNT is bad and it also does not present a quality setup at the moment. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/analyzer/stock/TNT?key=690bddba-1b63-4685-a193-eb53e75e1267&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=TA&amp;utm_content=TNT&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2021-12-08T04:21:00Z
$TNT I believe today&#39;s amended 40-F submission puts the SEC &quot;IF&quot; question to and end. Clearly, as company said, the comments were about name change and address change. Company first replied via a letter, and then submitted a formal amendment to make everything official, while included all NRs and Q3 financials to make everything up to date.

Now we just wait for the inevitable to happen.,2021-12-08T04:17:40Z
$TNT &quot;The Issuer continued to hire several new employees as it prepares to launch its Canadian operations.&quot;,2021-12-08T04:06:21Z

$TNT sorry but I can‚Äôt stop laughing! Shorts and bears where ya at??? Haha,2021-12-08T03:37:12Z
$TNT after reading the latest form 7, we now know that Tenet replied to the SEC comments on Nov 30 and today the amended form 40-f was updated to include such comment concerns.. SEC approval and Nasdaq re-listing imminent IMO, we have a partnership agreement coming with the 2nd largest oil and gas company in the world if I‚Äôm correct (google), the only remaining question is!!! How fast can the shorts cover ? ü§£ü§£ü§£,2021-12-08T03:35:05Z
$TNT Company Profile. PetroChina Company Limited (‚ÄúPetroChina‚Äù) is the largest oil and gas producer and distributor, playing a dominant role in the oil and gas industry in China. It is not only one of the companies with the biggest sales revenue in China, but also one of the largest oil companies in the world.,2021-12-08T03:33:27Z

$TNT I can&#39;t wait for the day our ticker updates on stocktwits again.,2021-12-08T02:58:01Z
$TNT  The second important event to occur during the period was the negotiation between the Issuer and PetroChina for a partnership agreement that would see the Issuer provide
supply-chain services to PetroChina convenience stores. An
announcement for the signing of the agreement was expected shortly following the filing of this report.,2021-12-08T02:56:02Z

$TNT   Is a form 7 (monthly report)  for the previous month only or can / does it include anything up to the date of filing?,2021-12-08T00:37:33Z
$TNT I am thinking the Monthly Report has been delayed because of the SEC filing. If they had filed the report, then they would had to have included on amended Form-40. Probably figured it was best to request a delay. One less thing for the SEC to have to review. Just speculating.,2021-12-08T00:22:58Z
