$TNT Let&#39;s just hope it&#39;s not a T12 like someone said below. Per my Google search, most T12s never resume trading..... Hopefully it&#39;s just a T1 and has to do with Cuebler news,2021-09-21T01:31:10Z
$TNT  wtf seeing conflicting reasons now from different sources,2021-09-21T01:29:44Z
$TNT Why would they ask for additional information now and not prior to listing.?? They‚Äôve had tons of time to do so. Makes no sense.,2021-09-21T01:28:41Z
$TNT @killmenow is right. T12s aren&#39;t usually good. T1 or T5 halts are normally no reason for alarm but T12 is usually not positive,2021-09-21T01:15:43Z
$TNT if you just Google T12 Halt it‚Äôs almost always a bad thing. Sonofabitch.,2021-09-21T01:09:13Z
$TNT  merger perhaps?.   UPST would be crazy not to just throw $7B at this, which is chump change to them.,2021-09-21T01:06:48Z
$TNT,2021-09-21T01:06:18Z
$TNT let‚Äôs go!!,2021-09-21T01:04:39Z
$TNT why would they request a halt for good news?,2021-09-21T00:59:01Z
$TNT  Peak bought out by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. for $52.70 per share !!!!,2021-09-21T00:42:58Z
$TNT interesting order flow for Canadian side today. Also we are halted pending news,2021-09-20T23:50:52Z
$TNT Halted‚Ä¶ due to News Pending‚Äù‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt wait. Cubeler purchase, international partner, etc.. which one will it be? So exciting!,2021-09-20T23:50:36Z
$TNT Let the fun begin!  We are halted!,2021-09-20T23:42:49Z
$TNT trade halt (T12) was alerted within seconds at tradethehalt.com with the halt price of $9.11 and volume of 750.96K.,2021-09-20T23:19:02Z
$TNT mostly got low 9s but did get a limit order filled of 8.9 in the afternoon.

I‚Äôm not too worried about timing the bottoms completely. I‚Äôm just happy to get closer to my 500 share goal before this hits $15.,2021-09-20T21:48:20Z
$TNT  this whole Evergrande debacle further cements the fact that China needs more oversight via data .... China needs Peak, both data wise and promoting SME&#39;s to avoid another &#39;too big to fail&#39; scenario.,2021-09-20T21:22:46Z
$TNT No powder to add :( 
Enjoy the dip.,2021-09-20T20:51:45Z
$TNT Per Fidelity, after hours is $9.55?  Anyone else also seeing that on their broker sites?,2021-09-20T20:26:20Z
$TNT best day ever - never thought I‚Äôd get another chance to load up again under $9

Wooooo f‚Äôn hoooo!,2021-09-20T19:52:03Z
$TNT I am down well over 6 figures today, but I have confidence. 

I had an order in earlier today for $8.50. It didn&#39;t execute. Debating whether to get in before market close today.

Onwards.,2021-09-20T19:51:10Z
$TNT significant news is due out this week. Use this overdone pullback as a buy opportunity.,2021-09-20T19:40:57Z
$TNT fucking day traders..,2021-09-20T19:18:28Z
$TNT Short sale restriction officially in effect for the rest of the day and tomorrow,2021-09-20T18:52:02Z
$TNT I thought nasdaq was supposed to help with the volatility lol,2021-09-20T18:45:25Z
$TNT days like today provide buying opportunities here. üß®üß®üß®,2021-09-20T18:04:57Z
$TNT Side note, have you guys seen the movement on FOBI and AMPD today?,2021-09-20T18:00:55Z
$TNT Bottom line‚Ä¶China needs Peak Fintech to aid in keeping fair and transparent lending practices in check for all SMEs to thrive‚Ä¶today shows why,2021-09-20T17:38:14Z
$TNT I‚Äôve seen this so many times, they‚Äôre trying to orchestrate a market correction, when Morgan Stanley comes out and says 20% they really want 12%‚Ä¶who knows if they‚Äôll even get that, today it‚Äôs China, yesterday it was the debt ceiling.. the stocks that hold up well will be the first ones out of the gate when the market re-corrects.
Hold or addüòé,2021-09-20T17:34:09Z
$TNT Didn&#39;t JJ acknowledge the behavior of ridiculous lending in China and defaults, during a recent interview? i.e., this whole Evergrande situation. Shows me he&#39;s thinking a step ahead and possibly looking to take advantage of it....,2021-09-20T17:25:41Z
