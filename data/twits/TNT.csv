$TNT  Sooo , if anything all this scrutiny by the SEC will get any questions over with right here, right now ;P,2021-09-24T03:55:33Z
$TNT @jrockford What is your take on this situation? Really appreciate the insights!,2021-09-24T03:44:51Z
$TNT I only got 1k shares . not enough.,2021-09-24T02:28:42Z
$TNT In all my years of investing I live by this graphic once I complete due diligence and believe I have a good investment in a company such as I do in Peak. Funny thing is also looks the $UPST journey which we are now starting!,2021-09-24T02:11:03Z
$TNT selling some of my magnificent UPST and doubling up on TNT and having peak halted on the same day is hurting. But for some reason I feel good about this stock. I hope I am right.,2021-09-24T01:23:34Z
$TNT,2021-09-24T01:02:01Z
$TNT Honestly at this point I hope it dips hard once it gets trading back on the NASDAQ.  I just closed out a few positions so I wouldn&#39;t mind another 300 shares at $7 rather than $10+.,2021-09-24T00:59:25Z

$TNT post from a Scottm on discord: The information presented here is fantastic. I can only imagine what those investors outside this group must be thinking. This is a great opportunity to continue to invest in this company at extremely low valuation. Great job team

$TNT What‚Äôs amazing with Peak right now is the amount of knowledge it‚Äôs investors are learning about the company (that‚Äôs right including the fact that it‚Äôs a Canadian company with subsidiaries operating in China‚Ä¶no different than Apple‚Äôs setup). This will only benefit the stock price in the mid to long term given it will be less prone to sell offs. As well, I‚Äôm sure this situation is being discussed at the institutional level raising positive awareness of Peak. Thoughts?,2021-09-23T21:02:50Z

$TNT people have to stop defending Peak and saying it‚Äôs a Canadian company. If you know all subsidiaries and Peaks ownership in each of them then you can say that Peak ‚Äúowns‚Äù Chinese companies. 49-51% is a significant amount and SEC is doing a great job protecting investors and making sure you guys don‚Äôt lose money if things go south.,2021-09-23T19:04:35Z

$TNT So. A VIE is when a wholly Chinese owned company makes a show that anybody foreign still owns a percentage of their companies. *checks notes*; aaaand, Peak is Canadian. in the trash with this negative-speculation,2021-09-23T18:39:57Z

$TNT doorknob on discord:

Recent talks with management  indicate we will be trading on the NASDAQ by Oct 3rd  at the latest.   Someone in the SEC dept. lumped us in with some companies that are not properly regulated  as per a new set of regulations that came out with the SEC  CALLED &quot;VIE&quot; on Form 40-F filings. They have teams of lawyers from Benchmark , our offices, plus Chinese lawyers sent documents that we certainly have followed regulations to a &quot;T&quot;  and are not in that category at all ! The lawyers are working hard to fix this because TNT wants to trade much earlier than Oct 3rd. The NASDAQ is on our side and is not in agreement with the SEC , but TNT wants to remain in good standing with the SEC.  The SEC IMHO put the cart before the horse and should have let us trade until the reviewed it thoroughly to see that we should not have been lumped in with those other companies , hence all the lawyers stepped in as we have significant news we wish to put on cubeler and revised,‚Ä¶,2021-09-23T18:15:02Z
$TNT Anyone else spoken with Peak IR? Any explanation given? Stalling in price action is temporary and we will resume upward trend soon enough. I‚Äôm buying more tomorrow to set up for next week. Long.,2021-09-23T18:08:37Z
$TNT I spoke to IR at Peak.  The SEC reviewer analyzing the 40-F is concerned that Peak is a VIE.  Here is a link on VIEs - https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/china/chinese-companies-using-vie-structure-to-raise-money-from-foreign-investors-report.html

That&#39;s what is holding this up.  Peak and the NASDAQ are livid and feel that it is clear that from the information provided that they are not a VIE.  There is supposed  to be reciprocity between Canadian and US regulators.  Peak&#39;s registration was approved by Canadian regulators when they raised money earlier in the year.  SEC should honor that.  If the SEC reviewer doesn&#39;t come around soon they will go over her head to her superiors.   If this was not an accelerated listing it would have be cleared by October 3.  IR said that is the worst case scenario for it to being trading on NASDAQ again.  Hopefully much sooner.,2021-09-23T17:23:39Z
$TNT I really love taking advantage of people who think and behave like the stock market is like going to the casino. I&#39;ve done that myself when I started ~25 years ago, and it took me a few years to realize that the role I was playing was that of a liquidity provider... somebody else was profiting.,2021-09-23T17:18:22Z
$TNT for all the new investors freaking out this might actually be a blessing for you that the stock isn‚Äôt trading at the moment.  This way you cant make any emotional and irrational decisions.  The SEC might be your saving grace LOL,2021-09-23T17:16:47Z
$TNT lets go already !! Fuckers,2021-09-23T16:44:35Z
$TNT Holding these levels on the Canadian exchange is actually very bullish IMO.  Please feel free to remind the bears that stonks don&#39;t go straight up.  PAYience.,2021-09-23T16:29:47Z
