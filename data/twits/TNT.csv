$TNT We‚Äôll booked my stops along my sailing route. All ready to go. See you in a week. Maybe I‚Äôll fit in a text along the way, but not sure if I‚Äôll care enough to follow. Cash is king now and into Christmas. Cheerio. And for those that want to be rude and so on as part of their perma bull echo chamber‚Ä¶ haters will be haters. ;),2021-12-06T02:15:51Z

$TNT &quot;I like the stock&quot; - Keith Gill aka Roaring Kitty,2021-12-06T01:33:25Z
$TNT Lots of folks here partaking in this bull echo chamber about to be a taught a further 20% drop lesson. gather your facts on a macro level and make the moves YOU are comfortable with‚Ä¶not what this bull board keeps telling you since $14. Hold or sell up to you. There are two sides to every coin and this board only wants to evaluate the bull side of the coin. Now I expect the usual baloney from the bulls. And that‚Äôs ok.,2021-12-06T00:26:22Z
$TNT additionally for the &quot;take profits&quot; scalpers bashing longs --- I long campaign and position trade primarily with clear entry and exit plans looking for higher multiples. I dont compound 20% swing trades here and there -- I do a lot of DD and spot asymmetrical value for a multibag and I judge my winners via X and not % -- 

You can do your own system but most of you overtime never compound any significant gain and thus go back and forth with smaller gains and losses. 

In short, we don&#39;t care -- nor are you correct in the mid and long term for being worried about a temp bearish swing--- we will revisit in the not so distant future when you say &quot;wish I had held onto....&quot;

$TNT macro outlook--- media now running with Megatron variant is mild and the positives of a mild variant becoming dominant --- futures not blood red --- Evergrande FUD to be updated(CCP kicks can down road)&amp; then questions of tapering. 

Rates are already low so what&#39;s a light raise going to do or maybe even none as current US admin wouldn&#39;t want to exacerbate losses via nuking the markets --- just logic. 

However, I think we can see most of the recent insano FUD being dispelled. 

That being said--- hope you&#39;ve all been able to add dips everywhere. I&#39;ve backed up my dump truck and picked up some extra bags personally.,2021-12-05T23:33:13Z

$TNT: The Revenue is expected to grow by 119.68% on average over the next 5 years.

$TNT 2x P/S 2022 and profitable.   This is not your typical overpriced growth stock.,2021-12-05T18:42:53Z
$TNT Been a rough go with Tenet since the Nasdaq delisting but the overall markets have taken a hit, so we aren‚Äôt alone.  With my conviction high, I‚Äôm fully locked and loaded on my TNT investment and now I wait for the market games to be play out and for management to execute!  

For those interested, I‚Äôve also been adding to my position on $AUAG as this rare earth mining junior appears to be poised for massive 2022-2024 especially with the REE demand at an all time high!  GLTA,2021-12-05T18:31:07Z
$TNT still here and still adding. I  reached my goal last week and may continue to add if we head lower. Tnt is now my biggest holdings good luck everyone,2021-12-05T17:23:33Z
$TNT I did alot of selling out positions last  Monday/ Tuesday as my growth  stocks were getting wacked . Sold some  winners to cover some losers . Hate  that mostly cash now .. one grower I didn&#39;t sell is pkkff . 3500 shares yes under water now but I think this one has legs . I&#39;ll try not to watch it to much . Looking forward to getting our symbol back TNT.. that might be the best present Santa has in the bag...,2021-12-05T12:47:51Z

$TNT Now that 2021 revenue is all but official, I would like to start thinking about how the 2022 revenue could come to pass. Let&#39;s assume the Clean Tech Hub gets launched / announced in Q4 as expected: we would then have all 5 pillars operational in 2022. How do you envision this growth unfolding? 
 
General -- 20 / 30 / 30 / 40 = 120m 
Insurance -- 5 / 10 / 15 / 20 = 50m 
Oil -- 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 =  70m 
Steel -- 5 / 10 / 15 / 20 = 50m 
Clean Tech -- 5 / 10 / 15 / 20 = 50m 
 
Q1 = $45m 
Q2 = $75m 
Q3 = $95m 
Q4 = $125m 
2022 = $340m 
 
What adjustments would you make?,2021-12-04T21:24:21Z
