$TNT I just made this chart.  I think this range is completely realistic if they hit guidance.  The multiples will depend on the broad market sentiment as well as the sentiment towards Tenet.  But in 2023 with global expansion 40 PE is not only realistic but under certain market conditions, could be too modest when taking into account the YoY growth. 
 
The potential on just  current guidance is pretty amazing and could be life changing for many of us here. 
1000% in  a few years doesn&#39;t seem like that bad of a return.,2022-03-10T02:57:18Z

$TNT --&gt;Today marks 7 weeks since the last Form-40 was filed. I fully suspect the SEC has been in contact with JJ. Management is working behind the scenes. At some point, we will see an amendment filed. Some time in March is my guess.,2022-03-09T12:08:02Z

$TNT sorry didn‚Äôt mean to spam your board. Forgot it would show up here. Hi to all the great people here tho. As long as they relist this will bounce back in time. They have a decent product at the very least, no competition and lots of runway. I still find it weird that it‚Äôs been taking this long and no communication from company. Like they could have mentioned something small in last nights form 7 release or whatever it‚Äôs called. Anyways for those of you who remember I took a break from all social media for a while to focus on centring myself and just enjoying life more and I was in a funk so I regrouped sold out of tnt at around 6.50$ and went into oil. Athabasca and Meg. Doing better and am able to provide for my tiny princess now. Although my wife takes her cut. üòÇ üò≠,2022-03-08T15:49:17Z
$FOBIF this is what they meant by Fobi 50! üéÇ for those of you who remember the Las Vegas show. üòÇ anyways don‚Äôt mean to put salt on wounds but a little humour helps. I‚Äôll just say that IMHO the CEO has been making too many creative excuses for why they haven‚Äôt gotten the big deals. I guess the latest one is privacy reason? Before that is they were fine tuning and responding to great feedback. I mean it can all be true but in this business you gotta walk the talk eventually. They haven‚Äôt and hence the feedback. I might actually by in on Friday or once sentiment changes around the war. This is a falling knife right now. Good luck to all. I want everyone to make money except for @investorguru. He was a troll on $tnt board üòÇ,2022-03-08T15:40:06Z
$TNT fundementals strong ! Thank god. SP will be fine sooner or later. Way undervalued. Happy times ahead !,2022-03-08T14:48:46Z
$TNT Loved the first couple monthly updates this year, essentially Management has told us that they are meeting / exceeding their 2022 guidance so far this year (with the year being about 20% over). Pair this with Managements history of meeting / exceeding guidance. Essentially the price is where it‚Äôs at because the market doesn‚Äôt believe the 2022/2033 guidance yet, but it will start to as each quarters earnings are posted this year.,2022-03-08T14:37:23Z
$TNT  nice form 7...when spring arrives in a less than 8 trading days  .... the flowers will not be the only thing blooming here....... sunny days ahead longs., very soon,2022-03-08T13:58:39Z
$TNT From the Form 7, it seems some of the speculation on whether the Ukraine situation would be beneficial has been confirmed. The conflict is driving up O&amp;G business through the UnionPay partnership. 
 
I didnt like hearing that they are struggling to find talent though. They should consider posting jobs on yahoo and stocktwits message boards. I&#39;m sure they could find plenty of free labor from some of yall !,2022-03-08T13:41:39Z
$TNT --&gt; Some solid nuggets in this month&#39;s Form 7. Steel and Oil n gas attracting &quot;a new class&quot; of companies. Q1 revenue should be solid. 
 
Financials being worked on. Although a date not given, should be released in about 3 weeks. 
 
I&#39;m out of scratch or I would pick up more shares. 
 
SEC back-n-forth behind the scenes is my best guess. I would assume another amendment will be filed in the coming days / weeks. 
 
My attention is on the week of March 28th to April 1st.,2022-03-08T13:38:16Z
