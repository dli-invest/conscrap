$TNT   Not sure why I even come on here to listen to some of the most infintile, crying little babies imaginable.  If you cant wait for an investment to unfold, and that includeds through the rough patches,  then dont fucking invest.  So sell now or shut  up and wait.,2022-03-07T21:48:29Z
$TNT is there a concrete earnings date yet, or is that too difficult for management as well?,2022-03-07T20:56:35Z

$TNT I&#39;m still in Peasant mode financially but when I get my settlement,this Tenent company is going to turn me into primarily having a swing trader first mentality.Hours,minutes,seconds might be my exposure to companies.The only way I will hold long is with companies that lost 90% of their value over shareholders emotional overreactions or with commodities/Energy out of favor.Every other damn day Peak management was hyping how great everything was going up until NASDAQ delist .Raised all that money with offerings and don&#39;t even have a goddamned TENET website up and running.Im in too deep here to give up but damn JJ needs to either expose the fraud or reverse the BS already..,2022-03-07T17:17:23Z

$TNT Spoke briefly to Cathy in IR this morning.  Not much to report.  2021 Full year earnings expected at the end of this month.  No comments back from SEC on 40-F amendment as of Friday when she last checked in.,2022-03-07T15:35:46Z
$TNT another day, another 10% drop,2022-03-07T15:33:46Z
$TNT Is the SEC ghosting us?  It&#39;s been over 6 weeks since the 40-F amendment.  Don&#39;t they have to respond at some point?,2022-03-07T15:28:01Z
$TNT You think management will come out of their hole this week?,2022-03-07T15:20:10Z
$TNT Wen New Website?Should&#39;ve been done simultaneously when the new logo dropped,just a mess with a confusing TNT and PKKFF ticker and a Peak Tenet Positioning website yet it&#39;s supposed to be Tenet.Bullish as I want to be over it&#39;s underlying business,it&#39;s shareholder value creation has been subpar.,2022-03-07T14:15:30Z

$TNT  Peter Piatetsky: Beijing has all the cards here and it&#39;s a very bad situation for Russia because Russia is a net exporter, but it doesn&#39;t have that many different exports -- minerals, diamonds, [uranium, wheat], but primarily oil -- and Europe is its main destination for oil. 
 
China could buy up that extra oil, but it does not seem to be willing to and Russia&#39;s main external trading relationship is with China. However, China&#39;s main external trading relationship is with the United States. So what we&#39;ve seen so far is that China has been very quietly enforcing U.S. sanctions.,2022-03-06T15:13:25Z
$TNT  Anyone think there is a good possibility that Putin&#39;s own higher up people stage a coupe?   I do...

$TNT  Interesting excerpt from an article I was reading in USA Today.   
 
  There are also indications of poor morale among Russian troops, according to the Defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence findings. Food and fuel shortages along with poor training have contributed to morale problems. The main Russian force arrayed against Kyiv remains stuck about 15 miles from the city&#39;s center. 
 
&quot;There&#39;s enough evidence that there are Russian soldiers who do not want to fight and are not on board with killing Ukrainians,&quot; Smith said. &quot;There&#39;s equipment that&#39;s been left behind, and they didn&#39;t just run out of gas. There&#39;s equipment that&#39;s been just left behind wholesale â€“ perfectly working equipment â€“ with no Russian soldiers in sight.&quot;,2022-03-06T14:24:48Z
