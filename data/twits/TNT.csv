$TNT hey btw hawkish Fed now? Good luck with that. Qtr % hike at best and then dovish to deal with the fall out of Russo-Ukraine debacle = money back into risk. 

Dont be in cash lol.,2022-02-28T05:20:25Z
$TNT you guys may not see it right this second but all happenings RN as unfortunate as they are happen to be fundamentally maximum bullish for both DeFi(crypto)and Fintech. New era we are moving in. We cant control it but the chips will fall into decentralization which long term will improve life for everyone and the correct assets are obvious. 

Of course you have bear idiots posting about nuclear armageddon as a reason to sell(don&#39;t know what you&#39;d do with your money with everything and everyone gone lol)but reality is current US disgusting administration will be routed in Nov, Putin weakened by this and sped up rise of DeFi and associated Fintech which indeed is power back to the people and transfer of wealth.,2022-02-28T05:19:05Z

$TNT Trying to dig into whether the sanctions on Russia will impact revenue for Tenet whether positively or negatively. Curious to hear peoples thoughts. I‚Äôd assume increased lending between Russia and China is good unless TNT would not be able to participate in this.,2022-02-27T17:11:56Z
$TNT I am introducing @gamblerjag  ‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs been my good friend for a long time and is thinking about investing some very serious money. He wants to know who my favorite people are here. I told him there‚Äôs so many good people on this thread..it is like no other thread on Stocktwits. Say üëã,2022-02-27T03:54:31Z
$TNT Select Russian banks will be blocked from SWIFT. I believe the dramatic rebound we saw Friday was due to investors seeing that Russia had been spared from this during the first round of sanctions. 

Personally I applaud the decision. It may cause more financial pain for all of us but some things are more important and besides, long term we&#39;ll still do fine.

$TNT I highly think SEC has responded. It‚Äôs more likely that they have than they have not (considering the uncharacteristic time since the last submission) 

I believe Tenet is completing the last portion of what SEC has asked for. They get an informal approval through their behind the scenes communication w their SEC rep that, yes, Everything is now completed to their satisfaction. 

They attach the latest news releases and any other addendums / exhibits and we submit one last 40 F amendment to EDGAR. This last one will in a day or two have SEC sign off.  (Since it‚Äôs just a formality and it‚Äôs all
Been checked off) 

Another person had shared a wild back on a different forum comparables somewhat of other companies having gone though something similar and the Nasdaq re-approval so to speak comes a couple days (or even a day) after SEC effectiveness. 

Hope I‚Äôm right. We are due on this matter and I think the time for the great news has come.,2022-02-26T14:46:53Z

$TNT Until we get over the mid 5&#39;s and hold this is a dead cat bounce. Best case scenario nasdaq is announced, but it would be nice if the stock goes sideways and builds a base at least.,2022-02-25T16:31:51Z
