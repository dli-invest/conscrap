$TNT   Smart for Tenet to identify this growing market a year ago and put it into action with it&#39;s deal with Gruppo Coin.

$TNT  Happy New Year all !

 Been a hell of a year for Tenet. Newer investors may not fully realize the scope of just how amazing 2021 was (hold on to those bags of cash through the volatility because 2022 is coming in hard on massive growth in revenue, positive earnings and execution)

I will  list some of the highlights of 2021 below in the replies as there is too many to squish into one post.,2022-01-01T09:24:40Z
$TNT is expected to show a strong revenue growth of 119.68% yearly. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/analyzer/stock/TNT?view=fundamental-analysis&amp;key=690bddba-1b63-4685-a193-eb53e75e1267&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=TNT&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-01-01T08:20:00Z

Singles Day: $7.8 million

Tenet had $25.6 million revenue last quarter with no special shopping events.

$TNT 

Good morning/Good afternoon to everyone on the TNT stocktwits page. 

I have recently purchased my 5000th TNT share today and have been holding from my initial buy at $7.50USD while adding on the way down. 

I wrote out a 1000 word post prior to this post but accidentally lost it so I will summarize my thoughts briefly:

I have been following this stocktwits page since mid September before purchasing shares and have seen my fair share of good content (RooksL) and bad (investorguru), not to mention a symbolic office water cooler filled with kool-aid.

Tenet has been sketching me out a bit with this horrible IR-the grammar from Kathy and Barry is weak for a professional company 2 say the least (and I am no shining star). The one thing I will say is that when you have 100 flags and 94 of them are green-the red flags stick out much easier compared to a sea of 61 green flags and 39 red flags. 

3/4 largest oil companies? Cmon boys. Bullhorns. Not perma-bullhorns. Healthy skepticism.,2021-12-31T19:09:11Z

$TNT Happy New Year All.  

I recognize that the past few months have been disappointing with the SP decline and many complain about the company, the CEO, etc.  From my point of view, the company and leadership have executed extremely well but yes a few mistakes have certainly delayed some progress.  The SEC delays are a completely different story and no matter what, we would still face this scrutiny with Gensler rule changes - many Nasdaq companies with heavy Chinese operations will experience the same pain soon enough.  

Remember Tenet was a micro cap stock not long ago and our fundamentals are clearly proving the path forward will be great!  This journey requires patience, but I do respect those that need to move on.

If your conviction is all but gone, I would suggest maybe moving on to other well known companies that have been beat up over the past months like us, such as:  UPST, STNE, ZM, or PYPL 

GLTA - Stay safe and well. üß®üß®üß®üß®,2021-12-31T16:16:28Z

$TNT Fundamentals keep getting stronger in the background while trolls will keep whining about share price and a delay out of Tenets control.  The deeper they push this down with FUD and manipulation the harder it will pop when we get clarity. I have seen no logical reason the SEC will not make Tenet&#39;s 40f effective. Not one troll has a shred of evidence otherwise.,2021-12-31T15:50:13Z
