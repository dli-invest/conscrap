$TNT again let‚Äôs remind ourselves that the whole market especially fintech has taken a beating recently, eg. Upstart from over $400 per share to $70 recently, we‚Äôre not the only one and actually not even as bad as Upstarts decline, but on a realistic note, SEC approval and a 40 million revenue Q4 is what‚Äôs really going to jump start this beauty! Anyone know if it‚Äôs possible to get year end and Q4 financials by March 01?,2022-02-08T21:07:12Z
