$TNT many people seem to forget that Tenet is a software technology company.. virtually endless scalability thanks to the cloud, epic profit margins, and the DATA that theyâ€™re organically cultivating and harnessing will be monetized and sold for even more revenue and profits. This is a big fat money printing machine in a few years. WAKE UP!,2021-12-09T15:10:22Z
$TNT  for those that still dont understand the business model..... the business hub reaches all areas of the supply chain for financing  from steel to oil to toilets to toys to food stands to coffee machines to car dealerships to insurance to clean tech to everything else.   Remember the 5 pillars.  

This is just the beginning folks.  We are in all for a treat in 2022,2021-12-09T15:00:14Z
$TNT  I like that Tenet has very versatile tech and can customize it for a customers particular purpose.    They do a lot more then just matching SME with financing.,2021-12-09T14:57:05Z
$TNT Nice to see some volume starting to come through here and as a side note as someone mentioned (forget name sorry) the importance of this deal is it opens the doorway for Tenet to manage other aspects of inventory for PetroChina. This deserves to be rerated higher on that prospect alone. Congrats to all. Patient and thoughtful board.,2021-12-09T14:46:38Z
