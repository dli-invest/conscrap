$TNT Hey everybody :),2022-02-13T02:52:20Z
$TNT  
 
   Not trying to sugar coat anything, been a rough, volatile ride for a while now.  But based on execution, rev and net income growth with stellar guidance  this stock will go up to be sure.   
 
   This time I would rather see a steady uptrend.  Like it goes up a buck and consolidates a bit,, then another buck and consolidates a bit ,, goes up 3 bucks then pulls back a buck and consolidates a bit ,,  and so on and so on building strong support levels as we go. 
 
  If it does happened to spike up that frikin fast again i can only hope it doesn&#39;t pull back that far and has a good month at least to consolidate before the next leg.,2022-02-12T19:42:55Z
$TNT   Not sure why people always take a one time all time high spike as a comparison to how much we are &quot;down&quot; 
 
Upstart&#39;s all time high spike was WAY too fast for example. Shot clear up to 400 bucks,  now sits at less then 100 lol. 
 
What you don&#39;t want is a spike like Tenet had,  all time high up to 14.40 from 4.80 in 2 frikin weeks. That&#39;s just asking for a massive pull back in itself. 
 
  Now toss in months of proven manipulation as per short reports (an estimated 50% damage to our stock price) , the privilege of being caught in the middle of the SEC continuously updating the guidance in regards to operations in China, and the markets have been nothing but red across the board this whole year so far as well. 
 
You don&#39;t see me standing on a milk crate telling anyone to buy. (Although imo this price level is very appealing lol) 
 
  Financial decisions should be based on your own research, not on chat room garble whether it&#39;s negative or positive.,2022-02-12T18:58:45Z
$TNT People fighting here but logic can play tricks on you, it can give you a sense of relief to take some off the table and put it in something else you think it’s gonna double, but the reality is if you’re comfortable with the companies execution you would do the uncomfortable thing and add to your position. 
We only have a week left before we have more information.,2022-02-12T13:55:57Z

$TNT does the 30 days timeline to SEC apply to the current filing? and i felt that it&#39;s funny that the market was spook out from the potential raising interest when 5.2 trillion were printed during this covid situation.,2022-02-11T22:14:46Z
$TNT this is so painful. Just duck tape over my eyes so I can’t see what is going on and it’s all good.,2022-02-11T21:29:09Z
$TNT  buy when others are fearful....it&#39;s slap city today.,2022-02-11T20:17:56Z

$TNT people shouldn’t put hope into this stock. The rug pull from the SEC has been going on since September 2020. If you believe this stock can go to $100, then I think you can put your money elsewhere until we hear the all clear from the SEC.,2022-02-11T17:18:38Z
$TNT Increased position by 5% today, last time I bought was probably 7-8 months ago. More cash on sidelines would like to increase by another 5% within next month if possible. Price decline has been frustrating but presents an opportunity to accumulate more shares of companies you have high conviction in.,2022-02-11T17:18:20Z
$TNT Just hold and be rewarded. Buy if possible. This is a proper long term investment. Numbers don&#39;t lie.,2022-02-11T16:52:22Z
$TNT ..I have invested  a fair percentage of my portfolio in PKKFF and I truly believe in this company but i have to say the wait for the SEC to give Nasdaq approval seems to be going on forever and although  i know patience is the key and the rewards will come... i have to say I&#39;m getting so bored...,2022-02-11T15:30:17Z
$TNT Where the fuck is Nasdaq, this just continues to die a slow death.,2022-02-11T14:54:28Z
$TNT Whenever they finally have good uplisting news I expect they&#39;ll PR it on Monday or Tuesday like they did last time,2022-02-11T14:53:44Z
$TNT what’s the latest here? I’m bullish long term but don’t pay attention much because of the whole uplisting flop. Are we close?,2022-02-11T13:30:43Z

$TNT I hope they don’t get acquired. TNT has the potential to become a multi billion dollar company IMO. I wanna ride the wave.,2022-02-11T01:25:51Z
$TNT at this price Tenet looks like a good acquisition for someone IMO. Great way to get their way in the door in China, what is that worth?,2022-02-11T00:55:42Z
$TNT the week of 21st. Thats all i can disclose.,2022-02-11T00:46:05Z
$TNT I hardly ever stop in here. honest question. will tnt have to get in the same price range that the NASDAQ requires? And if so can I do that organically? Our shares got cut in half last time So I’m hoping that they ont be the case again.
