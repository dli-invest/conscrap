$TNT Hoping this is just an error, but I am on my Fidelity account just checking things getting ready for tomorrow and Fidelity is stating that my TNT shares appear no longer halted BUT the stock price has come down to $7.53.  That can&#39;t be right,2021-09-30T05:43:54Z
$TNT Can someone explain why the numbers on cubeler.cn don&#39;t tally with their report? Is the Cubeler site not updating?

$TNT Here is the official request from Peak to  withdraw the earlier form 40-F submission from Nasdaq. Now they can fill the information based on the feedback from SEC and resubmit.,2021-09-30T02:57:20Z
$TNT My fellow Peak Investors, I purchased a three month gift subscription to the New York Times digital for someone, and they have not redeemed it (I was trying to encourage her to be more active in paying attention to the news). No one I care about seems to be interested in receiving this, so I thought I would offer it to you all. The first person. Who comments that they want it, gets it.,2021-09-30T02:51:05Z

$TNT doorknob today on discord:

Talking direct to management again.  There should be a news release by end of this week on the cubeler closing. Tomorrow there will be discussions with the SEC  on any clarifications of exactly what they need to put on the new Form 40F  .  It does seem the SEC is cooperating fully with our lawyers so we can resolve the issue as soon as possible.,2021-09-30T02:20:54Z
$TNT Garbage worthless stock,2021-09-30T00:29:20Z
$TNT loading more tomorrow, the lower it goes the more shares I can have!!,2021-09-30T00:20:44Z
$TNT I really want to believe in this company.  But things that are too good to be true are usually just that.,2021-09-30T00:11:14Z
$TNT Withdraws Form 40-F because TNT is NOT a Canadian company...derp! Despite what the brainiacs on this board insist on, JJ and his Canuck charade will most likely be found out for what they really are.  Unfortunately for them, they can&#39;t or won&#39;t agree to the reporting requirements demanded of them by the SEC. 

I may be wrong, but I see TNT as a front for a CCP inspired money funnel to China.  And if that&#39;s true, the real question is how many others? 

I feel sad for the American investors who so desperately want to provide aid and comfort to the enemy.  Too bad, tears...,2021-09-29T23:11:37Z

The positive thing when the SEC will approve
TNT , a lots of FUD will disappear, making TNT/PKK stronger

$TNT do your research. This is just a hiccup and will be uplisted when the new form 40F is complete. Different requirements for companies with significant operations in China. Not worried a bit. Will probably buy more this week.,2021-09-29T22:34:08Z

$TNT I bought a 4 at 6 at 8 and will continue to average up til we hit $100 a share. All you day traders who are crying today I suggest you stop gambling and get a clue.,2021-09-29T20:58:50Z
$TNT The SEC problems stem from JJ&#39;s inexperience and inability to execute.  I think he&#39;s the weakest CEO of any NASDAQ company I have ever seen

And no, this isn&#39;t a &quot;Canadian Company,&quot; it&#39;s a Chinese dragon. And to those Americans blindly supporting Chinese companies to make a buck,  perhaps you should be a little more objective about who they are.,2021-09-29T20:22:00Z

$TNT after reading thru a few posts, i really wonder how many of you actually worked in a corporate environment, let alone as an exec or leader.

quite frankly, this crap doesn‚Äôt happen.  it just doesn‚Äôt and esp on the largest of stages.  you vet your proposal again and again and again. 

this is business and there are no feee passes. people will lose money.  maybe not you but someone will.

this is not business as usual and esp not after the pp delay.  let‚Äôs call it as it is.  a major eff up. 

the buck stops at the top.  can you imagine the BoD calls the past week.  I can‚Äôt and do t want to.

the china channel is killing it!  kudos.  the na channel is killing the company.  it‚Äôs that simple.  look at the org chart.  see the china structure?  where is the na strucure?  how is it going to happen? 

changes are needed and fast.  leadership needed and needed fast.,2021-09-29T17:57:36Z
$TNT Looking at the positives I feel like this can be up listed in 3-8 weeks timeframe.  It&#39;s nice to see PKK.CN holding up well after initial panic.  As long as you believe in the company&#39;s business model and growth prospects, this will ultimately be a small bump in the road.  Here is my favorite part of today&#39;s press release:

&quot;Peak will keep the NASDAQ informed of its progress with the amended Form 40-F, which Peak hopes will lead to having a revised Form 40-F be declared effective by the SEC on an expedited basis so that the Company&#39;s common shares will be listed on the NASDAQ as soon as possible.&quot;,2021-09-29T17:39:18Z
