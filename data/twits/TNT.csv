$TNT I really don&#39;t understand all the chattery here. It&#39;s Christmas and New Year&#39;s around the corner and you&#39;re talking about ambulances, a freaking PDF presentation, NASDAQ listing, Upstart... WTF?? Who cares!!! nothing you say or do has the most minimal impact on the stock price or how the company performs so just go hang out with friends and family (outdoors preferably) and don&#39;t be such scaredy cats with your money. PEACE!,2021-12-28T00:25:59Z

$TNT The majority of Qualcomm&#39;s (qcom) revenue, U.S. based semi-conductor giant, comes from China.  They don&#39;t seem to have a problem with the SEC and their stock does very well.   hmmmm.,2021-12-27T21:02:57Z

$TNT Everyone is overlooking this. And I‚Äôm kind of surprised they didn‚Äôt PR it when it happened , but 100k businesses on the hub ‚Äúas of September 2021‚Äù. Wow, a few people had questioned if they reached this milestone even by November and December since we didn‚Äôt hear a PR. But Tenet continuing to execute quietly behind the scenes. The adoption rate here is fantastic, wonder what they are at as of FY21?,2021-12-27T18:29:33Z

$TNT would the SEC review the 40f and ask for some some small changes in an amendment if what they reviewed wasn&#39;t good enough and they planned to out right deny it? No, that wouldn&#39;t make sense. Instead, they have reviewed it and asked for a few more small additions, which Tenet working with the SEC has complied. Now they review the amendment. No reason to believe they won&#39;t make it effective eventually. Anyone saying other wise has no serious evidence and should be labeled a short lying troll. ü§î,2021-12-27T17:06:09Z
$TNT  They seam confident in Nasdaq re-listing and the TSX and Hong Kong up-listings for 2022!!,2021-12-27T16:57:07Z

$TNT UPST is back up to $161/share and up 21% in the last 5 days. Bodes well for Fintech and TNT once we are back on the Nasdaq.,2021-12-27T16:07:36Z
$TNT what if they actually aren‚Äôt doing anything behind the scenes? Seems like they used to release news every week or at least bi-weekly. They haven‚Äôt released relevant news since nasdaq. The coffee shit is insignificant,2021-12-27T15:45:17Z

$TNT When you believe in Santa‚Ä¶. Then this will go to Nasdaq. Time to stop dreaming folks‚Ä¶.. My shares are parked and most likely I will have a new L&amp;H (Lernhout &amp; Hauspi) fiasco :). Who remembers that message about free T shirts, already many months ago - wondering who has received one ‚Ä¶.. stop dreaming, stop talking about Nasdaq and focus on the actual current stock what is on OTCBB‚Ä¶ GLTA and already Happy New Year ü•≥,2021-12-27T14:42:57Z
