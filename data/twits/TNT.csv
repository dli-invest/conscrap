$TNT Next Wednesday marks 7 weeks since the amendment was filed. Something has to be brewing behind the scenes. I assume JJ and the team are working on the next (and hopefully final) submission. At this point we wait for financials and soon after, perhaps TSX uplisting. Progress is being made. Was glad to be able to increase my share count. Holding for the long haul.,2022-03-04T11:54:41Z
