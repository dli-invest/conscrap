$TNT people already talking about $500M revenue in 2022 it‚Äôs ok to speculate but remember growing from $100M to $300M is already a rare achievement by itself so shouldn‚Äôt we rather stay focused on the guidance and be extremely happy if that number get‚Äôs hit not looking at $500M,2022-01-21T14:02:09Z
$TNT This train continues to move forward‚Ä¶ well done JJ!,2022-01-21T13:58:31Z
$TNT Can&#39;t state how BULLISH this company is right now. 
 
Great addition to the team! 
 
As JJ stated, the data is worth as much or greater to what revenue is going to be made in China. 
 
I think Tenet will generate 500M in revenue this year and over 1B next year,2022-01-21T13:55:42Z

$TNT Nasdaq would have Nasdicked us hard,2022-01-21T00:40:16Z
$TNT Dear SEC.  Tenet Fintech has put numerous scary as F* disclosures regarding the high likelihood the china will screw investors over.  And as a result all potential investors will be scared away after reading the registration statement.  Now can you just approve the god damn 40F already!  

Thank you!,2022-01-21T00:00:17Z
$TNT Market down because of a stupid streaming movie service NFLX.  OH NOOO THE MARKET IS CRASHING AND THE WORLD IS ENDING BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS TO WATCH ANYMORE DUMB MOVIES!!! I&#39;m telling ya historically and currently the market is full of idiots who just invest based on fart noises. Those people, bandwagon investors &amp; scared investors, deserve to lose money.,2022-01-20T23:53:26Z
$TNT might not be ideal to get back onto Nas at this moment tbh..Shocking markets.,2022-01-20T22:06:52Z
$TNT Investor Relations is useless.  I spoke to Cathy yesterday and asked what action was taken since the Dec 30 40F update from the SEC.  She said Tenet responded to SEC last week.  I asked if it was a letter or an amendment.  Cathy said it was a letter &quot;I believe&quot;.  I said &quot;why don&#39;t you know for sure?&#39;  She said that if it was an amendment it would show on SEC website.  Well Tenet filed an amendment yesterday!  How does she not know this.  Useless.  Good news is that amendment is filed.  Now we wait again.
