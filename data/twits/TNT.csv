$TNT  Curious to when they plan on moving into the USA market? Has that been addressed by management?,2021-11-20T15:44:49Z
$TNT someone posted the link  https://www.evranic.com/2021/10/my-reaction-to-grizzly-short-report-on.html

Just to be clear, I am bullish about the company. I just writing this because this whole short report and now law suit thing keeps me wondering where is ethics nowadays. Money at any cost seems to be the new mantra.,2021-11-20T15:44:48Z
$TNT --&gt; (1) The FUD is running out of time. Final week, and a short one in the US. Cross Thursday and Friday off the list (Thanksgiving long weekend). What are the odds the SEC is going to ask for further information on M, T or W? Possible yes, likely no. PR on Monday, Nov 29 &amp; back trading on Nasdaq Wednesday, Dec 1.  After that, JJ can announce the date of the Canada launch along with the Canadian partners. Plus the Clean Tech Hub launch. And the results of the Single&#39;s Day event. Let&#39;s hope Friday&#39;s bounce is an indication of what is to come and shorts cover their positions.,2021-11-20T13:25:34Z
$TNT  Happy Friday all!!

Little theme music for the shorties.

$TNT &quot;Tenet does not expect to wait very long to start seeing some returns on the investments it made in  
the third quarter of 2021. In fact, many began to pay off almost immediately and are expected to  
dramatically impact the Companyâ€™s forth quarter 2021 results. Other than the Singlesâ€™ Day  
shopping event, which should boost the Companyâ€™s revenue in Q4 much the same way the 618  
Shopping Festival jolted its revenue in Q2, most of the expected revenue growth from Q3 to Q4  
should come from the investments and events described above that took place during the third  
quarter.&quot;

Somebody let me borrow some money. I&#39;m looking to buy more shares.

$TNT @Antisfam Hey Elmer Fudd, straight from your own article: 
 
&quot;NO CLASS HAS YET BEEN CERTIFIED IN THE ABOVE ACTION. UNTIL A CLASS IS CERTIFIED, YOU ARE NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL UNLESS YOU RETAIN ONE. YOU MAY RETAIN COUNSEL OF YOUR CHOICE. YOU MAY ALSO REMAIN AN ABSENT CLASS MEMBER AND DO NOTHING AT THIS POINT. AN INVESTOR&#39;S ABILITY TO SHARE IN ANY POTENTIAL FUTURE RECOVERY IS NOT DEPENDENT UPON SERVING AS LEAD PLAINTIFF.&quot;,2021-11-19T23:00:47Z
