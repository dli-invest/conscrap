$TNT You have to always look at the positives in life. At least you didn&#39;t invest in a company doing business in Ukraine or Russia.,2022-02-23T01:22:30Z

$TNT anybody in the market for a kidney???,2022-02-22T19:39:22Z
$TNT I didnt see this sort of drawdown but macro BS just piled on all at once. Been thru worse tho and save the &quot;pricing in catastrophe&quot; BS--- similar drawdowns across small and mid cap tech everywhere including from who didnt see multiple explosive rise. 

Capitulators will be like the Plug Power capitulators that sold at 3 dollars before watching life changing money fly away in a mega rally.,2022-02-22T19:20:08Z
$TNT  Yeah figured this week would suck again. Every exchange is deep red again across the board. Good thing you only loose money if you sell :) 
  
  Wake me up in a week or 2 please,2022-02-22T18:55:31Z
$TNT This is complete insanity. This valuation is a spit in the face to the fundamentals this company have. I&#39;m trying to find anything, why todays price is justified. It&#39;s impossible. It doesn&#39;t add up. The market have to be pricing in either that PKK is lying about their financials or a crazy amount of dilution is going to happen.  
 
What a fucking joke.,2022-02-22T18:52:18Z
$TNT Sideline s**t talkers with no skin in the game be like....,2022-02-22T18:42:13Z

$TNT The fact here is, JJ rushed the Nasdaq listing to buy Cuebelar.  So therefore he ignored SEC Guidelines requiring paperwork because of the business in China.  Hence, he got his fat lips slapped and the SEC continues to punish him.  Again, pick up the phone and let him know what a Scumbag he really is!,2022-02-22T18:20:10Z
$TNT people who sell because of they are scared ‚úã‚úã‚úã they should never be here if you done your DD and see the long term goals you won‚Äôt sell because some uncertainty the stock price eventually always follow the fundamentals. The experienced investors stay because they know the future of the company and also the stock.,2022-02-22T18:19:09Z
