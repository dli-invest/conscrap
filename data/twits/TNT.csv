$TNT while we wait for the SEC to get their crap together,‚Ä¶highly recommend the StockFam discord for all things TNT/Peak related. It‚Äôs free, and well worth the 5 minutes that it takes to register within Discord.

$TNT From Hammy‚ù£Ô∏è‚ÄùThis is bringing a lot of eyes to the story of Peak.  Once this is all done Peak will only be stronger.  Silver lining to everything.‚Äù,2021-09-23T01:10:35Z
$TNT Everyone has to understand that the SEC did this, not Peak. Asking JJ to come out and explain this is pointless. What&#39;s he going to say? He probably knows as much as we know. The SEC didn&#39;t finish reviewing the listing before they listed. If you want to blame someone, blame NASDAQ for letting the listing go through without SEC approval.,2021-09-23T00:54:07Z
Many of you have seen me post about a major market inefficiency - that outstanding Canadian companies can&#39;t access reliable VC funding and so IPO too early and have to bootstrap their way to greatness.

I&#39;ve been posting about 3 in particular...

$FOBIF $KNRLF $TNT (was pkkff before uplist)

If you&#39;d added those 3 a month ago AND HELD, you&#39;d have seen a 67% composite gain. (The highs would have given you a composite 102% gain fyi).

This is to say that many people sniff at the OTC but there ARE well run gems on there, particularly Canadian ones,  if you take the time to research them properly and don&#39;t flip them for pennies.

I&#39;m long all 3 and see minimum 4-5x for all of them the next 2 years even from here.,2021-09-23T00:04:14Z
$TNT @stockguru: omg say it ain‚Äôt so . The Peak sky is falling n there‚Äôs an asteroid heading toward earth. The ignorance is palpable,2021-09-22T23:46:09Z

$TNT I have been busy at work. Am I happy that in two broader market recovery days we were halted? 

No. Did something go awry that should not have? Yes.

With that said, this company has managed communications and IR well, so I am confident this will be sorted out.

Not great, but onwards...,2021-09-22T19:18:37Z

$TNT delisted garbage. Complete let down,2021-09-22T16:31:42Z
$TNT Think of it this way! If there was a real problem canadian and european stock would be halted to not the case so only nasdaq problem with the info not financials. They literally stated that the sec F40 takes longer to review as expected so it was uplisted a bit to early but there are no problems with the company it is that the review took longer then expected  
 
nothing changed $20 -$25 EOY 
 
- major partner incoming
