$TNT What are the odds of Peak staying on the NASDAQ vs having to go back to the OTC Wild west market.  In your estimate.  Reply with &quot; 50-50&quot; or &quot;70-30&quot;, etc.   The first number is the percent chance we stay on NASDAQ.,2021-09-27T22:55:12Z
$TNT This was released last friday and include short interest on Nasdaq up until September 15th . Not bad actually I was expecting more....335k short interest or 0.85% of float,2021-09-27T21:30:46Z
$TNT I don’t know what’s wrong with my memory because I could not remember this ever happening to a stock I own before… but I just flashed on another company that I didn’t own,  the CEO got on CNBC and was explaining why the NASDAQ had halted him. And I can’t remember how that turned out. I believe fine I just don’t remember if the stock responded but it did get some attention.,2021-09-27T21:15:31Z
$TNT @stockguru; if it free falls , I will buy more,2021-09-27T20:58:55Z

$TNT For my fellow Americans, we closed at $8.10 USD on the Canadian exchange today. Our high for the day was $8.49 and started in the very opening. We dropped to as low as $7.89. The exchange rate for CAD to USD also shifted a penny, to 0.79.

Understand that price on the Canadian exchange doesn&#39;t necessarily determine what it would have done on the NASDAQ. I&#39;m just sure many of you are wondering how our baby is doing, but don&#39;t know anything about a Canadian dollar lol.,2021-09-27T20:52:04Z

$TNT  I spoke to the Peak director of communication today ...nothing new, they want to ensure they are not a VIE so the review is extensive and taking longer,  and they expect it to unhalt very soon.,2021-09-27T17:32:58Z
$TNT I’m going to keep updating this board with the Peak/Tenet catalyst list regularly. This is why we invested or considering investing. None of this has changed- the company is still performing on its growth trajectory. And it’s still undervalued.

$TNT this is going to pop when the halt comes off. Should play catch-up with the Fintech sector.,2021-09-27T16:24:34Z
$TNT Each company plays a role in the Fintech space (Affirm, Upstart and Peak)  This is a break down of what each one does and why Peak will come out the leader as they are at the top of Fintech chain

Peak Fintech Group soon Tenent Fintech Group offers the Business hub ecosystem solutions which automates the process for lenders to find borrowers across several market verticals that allow banks and lenders to safely increase loan volumes.  The Business Hub will be a global hub and is now operating across China, Canada, then next year it will be operating in the USA, Brazil, France and UK to start off

Upstart is an AI lending platform that partners with banks and credit unions to provide consumer loans using non-traditional variables, such as education and employment, to predict creditworthiness

Affirm operates as a financial lender of installment loans for consumers to use at the point of sale to finance a purchase. - Buy now and Pay later (BNPL),2021-09-27T16:19:41Z
$TNT They said the stock should be trading by Oct 3 at the latest (I&#39;m assuming they meant Oct 4 since the 3rd is a Sunday) If it goes past that, then maybe I&#39;ll worry. Will try to remain patient for now and focus on other stocks,2021-09-27T15:37:29Z
$TNT As much as I miss the volatility here, I&#39;m not swinging this one, so the longer it&#39;s halted the more news to rocket this.  It&#39;s annoying for sure, but it&#39;s in longs favor.  
Remember, shorts can&#39;t cover and right now and more big news is accumulating.  I&#39;m hoping for a big dip after the unhalt in a last ditch effort for shorts cause it&#39;s gonna spike very shortly after that.,2021-09-27T15:34:09Z

$TNT Oh please yes SEC masters; tell me what to think, when I can&#39;t show myself. Once that mentality is over with revisions and product announcements, I think we&#39;ll be on the up-and-up again. If only SEC did its job properly the first time. What an embarrassment. Volume is low on the CSE which indicates people know what&#39;s going on, but they&#39;re acting like lemmings,2021-09-27T13:54:13Z

It’s a little strange to me that this halt isn’t bigger news than it’s been. I thought it would bring a horde of new watchers here and just in general bring lots of new eyes to the stock. It seems like very few outlets have picked up the story. It’s just weird, I mean how often does shit like this happen? Why would so many just ignore the story?,2021-09-27T13:07:06Z
$TNT is valued rather cheaply when comparing the Enterprise Value to EBITDA ratio to the industry average of 47.09. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/TNT/fundamental-analysis?key=690bddba-1b63-4685-a193-eb53e75e1267&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=TNT&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2021-09-27T12:51:00Z
