$TNT At the heart of this rebranding is the change of the company name, Tenet, which was previously announced and became effective on November 1st, 2021.  Along with this change, a newly redesigned corporate logo has been revealed today with a new website planned to launch in the first quarter. 
 
&quot;Tenet&#39;s new visual identity is more modern and inviting and we believe better reflects our corporate vision, mission, and its evolution. Given our focus on global expansion and business development, it was the appropriate time to rebrand our company to bring a fresh look as we enter new markets,&quot; said Johnson Joseph, Chief Executive Officer of Tenet Fintech.,2022-01-27T13:11:05Z

$TNT   This is about as volatile as it gets,  many holding cash through, others tightening their grip on worthy stocks.   
 
   Keep those hatches battened down and ride out the storm folks. If it helps, review your DD as to why you got into the company in the first place and realize nothing has changed. 
 
   In fact the execution continues even more then it ever has. If you can hang in there instead of watching the entire market going through this you will come out ahead.  
Am I happy about all this crap?  Am I crying and complaining?  What will that accomplish? 
 
   Investors have the ability to look at the whole picture, YoY ,  not hour over hour. 
 
  If you think it will be like this forever and ever and ever then you letting times like these get under your skin.  
 
   Not going to post the strong fundamentals here yet again, you all should know them unless you did no DD (which I find hard to stomach) 
 
  These shares are a valuable,  strong growth always wins in the long run.,2022-01-26T10:55:25Z
