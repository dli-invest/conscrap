$TNT why is FASTCAPITAL not talking anymore.,2022-01-20T00:39:19Z
$TNT Looked over new amendment, found some changes in regards to the PCAOB, Grant Thornton China, and the new determinations announced by the PCAOB on Dec. 16, 2021..  Wow if that&#39;s all it was, SEC is really making Tenet jump through hoops, let me know if anyone finds anything else but in my opinion that was a very minor amendment and should be the last cherry on top for SEC approval,2022-01-20T00:38:48Z
$TNT Hey guys, whatâ€™s up with the document? Did Tenet resubmit the 40f?,2022-01-20T00:07:54Z
$TNT   shorts knew that had time to cover as long as the amended 40-f has not be re-filed..... Well, it&#39;s now refiled., let&#39;s see if we see some covering tomorrow.,2022-01-19T23:57:14Z
$TNT So, the delay was related to amendments to the 40-F requirements? The only amendment to the 40-F concerns statements related to VIE. See my previous posts for further information.,2022-01-19T23:16:39Z
$TNT https://sec.report/Document/0001062993-22-001221/,2022-01-19T23:11:15Z
$TNT Well that filing squashes the unknown for the time being and demonstrates that the SEC is still pushing forward.,2022-01-19T23:08:57Z
$TNT  i think we&#39;re close with the SEC. ... maybe days or weeks, who knows.  I&#39;m just scooping up as many as i can whenever it drops to 5.50.,2022-01-19T22:44:49Z
$TNT So who posted the fake email from Cathy or Barry about them responding and not needing to file an amendment? If anyone can find their name it would be great.,2022-01-19T22:38:52Z
