$TNT Johnson, the CEO, is perhaps the least qualified and weakest &quot;CEO&quot; I have ever seen of any NASDAQ listed company.  

He had NOTHING to do with the development of a Chinese Fintech nor does he have any experience in Chinese finance. He is so weak, if fact, that the only reason I can see for his position is to act as a figurehead for a much larger CCP inspired operation, legit or not. 

After all, anyone who criticizes a &quot;black&quot; CEO must be racist.  The reality is, the Chinese money men felt they needed a western face to raise capital.  There&#39;s no chance in hell that Johnson has anything meaningful to do with Chinese Fintech.  

So why the charade?  Anybody want to venture a guess? 

BTW, it&#39;s virtually impossible for a western entity to duplicate what TNT has done in China due to very tight controls over client data, sharing, access, protection from foreign competition, etc.   They only way TNT can do business in China is because the CCP want that to.,2021-09-22T03:00:01Z
$TNT From Geoff Yahoo forum: Peak Fintech blew away our revenue estimate of $25 million coming in with a $30.6 million quarter, which was growth of 322% compared with last year. Taking out the bank interest generation and ASCS loan servicing fees, platform and supply chain related revenues were $29.8 million compared to $6.2 million a year ago, or growth of 382%. Most of the revenues in the quarter were from low margin supply chain customers but the future growth is expected to come from higher margin services that will contribute gross margins between 50-60%. This quarter $2.0 million in revenues came from these higher margin services. The $2.0 million is the sum of the bank (ASFC) plus ASCS plus services generated from platform customers of $1.2 million. Although it was not evidenced this quarter, gross margin is expected to improve by the shift to using Gold River rather than outside suppliers, which could cut costs 30% for Peak.,2021-09-22T02:47:53Z
$TNT Remember boys and girls, last time we saw this many FUDers on this board, a short attack brought us down to $8 briefly, only to bounce right back to $10.  Position a little dry powder to be at the ready if you&#39;re looking to load up even more shares.,2021-09-22T01:41:12Z
$TNT @AMXX yes u are on to something: it‚Äôs the Chinese government using Peak Fintech as a Trojan horse to take over the entire world. JJ is just a pawn in this world wide conspiracy. Damn thanks for pointing that out. I am calling homeland security, the FBI, the CIA, n hell even my local police department to alert them to this devious Chinese scheme. Thanks Austin Powers! Now back to ur car bed with ur spider man jammies n have ur mommy tuck u in . Leave on the light so the monsters don‚Äôt get u ü§£ü§£ü§£,2021-09-22T01:18:55Z

$TNT I love that the bears are back spreading nonsense haha only tells me we will bounce back to ATH‚Äôs very soon! How long before we announce quarterly results of 50 million revenue+? With improving margins profits will increase accordingly, all these dips are gifts.. global business platform soon to be launched in Canada, then USA, then?!.. how fast will we hit 100,000 SME‚Äôs in China?

$TNT TNT is an entirely Chinese operation. Who knows what their true intentions are, but hiding behind a Canadian company, sneaking into the NASDAQ, and buying up a Canadian fintech platform all smells fishy to me. This is possibly why the SEC is investigating them.  I don&#39;t trust the CCP no more than I trust Covid.,2021-09-21T23:26:53Z

$TNT 

&quot;A stress test on banks‚Äô exposure to the property sector conducted recently by the central bank concluded that an extreme scenario, in which loans to developers suffered a 15-percentage-point rise in their non-performing ratios, would eat up 2.1 percentage points of banks‚Äô overall capital-adequacy ratios, reducing the industry average to 12.3%. Such a drop in the banks‚Äô capital buffers, evenly spread across the banking sector, would be a tolerable depletion of protection. But such a crisis would not hit banks even-handedly; weaker banks would see a much larger reduction, note analysts at S&amp;P Global, a ratings agency.&quot;

$TNT Something about this company doesn&#39;t add up. The CEO is NOT impressive to say the least.  I don&#39;t believe TNT will remain in its current form for very long, especially if it proves successful.  

Me, I think this is a Chinese operation disguised as a Canadian company which is listing on the NASDAQ for the sole purpose of raising American investment dollars for Chinese businesses.  A win-win for China. 

And this is why the SEC is looking into it.  It smells fishy.,2021-09-21T22:38:02Z

$TNT $UPST market cap is some 40x what TNT/Peak‚Äôs is. This bodes extremely well for Peak, particularly after we get the revised income projections and guidance shortly after the Cubeler acquisition is finalized. The acquisition should close this week.
