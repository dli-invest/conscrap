$TNT I am absolutely dumbfounded as to the price action of this stock.. literally so many great News Releases and nothing.. and still low volume.. Guess it&#39;s down to SEC approval and financials? Revenue should 3-4x and profits should 4-5x (minimum) this year,2022-02-04T22:30:53Z

$TNT  Reading this reminds me of why I invested in Tenet in the first place.  Like we have all been saying all along,  as 2022 and beyond unfolds this beast will show it&#39;s true colors. 
 
   Cant say I&#39;m a happy camper during the rough patches, but my eyes are still fixed on the prize here.,2022-02-04T13:47:43Z

$TNT if this paragraph doesn&#39;t get you excited, you&#39;re not paying attention. &quot;The consumer goods supply-chain segment has now replaced the raw materials supply-chain segment as the biggest contributor of the Company&#39;s revenue. Tenet is forecasting its 2021 revenue will triple in 2022 and the consumer goods segment is once again expected to pace its Chinese revenue throughout 2022. While other operational segments such as insurance and clean tech may eventually eclipse it in terms of revenue, the consumer goods supply-chain segment will continue to play a major role in Tenet&#39;s long-term plans as it will be the primary connection segment between the Company&#39;s Chinese Hub and its Hubs in other countries and regions of the world.&quot;,2022-02-04T13:09:33Z
