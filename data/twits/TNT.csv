$TNT  Peter Piatetsky: Beijing has all the cards here and it&#39;s a very bad situation for Russia because Russia is a net exporter, but it doesn&#39;t have that many different exports -- minerals, diamonds, [uranium, wheat], but primarily oil -- and Europe is its main destination for oil. 
 
China could buy up that extra oil, but it does not seem to be willing to and Russia&#39;s main external trading relationship is with China. However, China&#39;s main external trading relationship is with the United States. So what we&#39;ve seen so far is that China has been very quietly enforcing U.S. sanctions.,2022-03-06T15:13:25Z
$TNT  Anyone think there is a good possibility that Putin&#39;s own higher up people stage a coupe?   I do...

$TNT  Interesting excerpt from an article I was reading in USA Today.   
 
  There are also indications of poor morale among Russian troops, according to the Defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence findings. Food and fuel shortages along with poor training have contributed to morale problems. The main Russian force arrayed against Kyiv remains stuck about 15 miles from the city&#39;s center. 
 
&quot;There&#39;s enough evidence that there are Russian soldiers who do not want to fight and are not on board with killing Ukrainians,&quot; Smith said. &quot;There&#39;s equipment that&#39;s been left behind, and they didn&#39;t just run out of gas. There&#39;s equipment that&#39;s been just left behind wholesale ‚Äì perfectly working equipment ‚Äì with no Russian soldiers in sight.&quot;,2022-03-06T14:24:48Z

$TNT Next Wednesday marks 7 weeks since the amendment was filed. Something has to be brewing behind the scenes. I assume JJ and the team are working on the next (and hopefully final) submission. At this point we wait for financials and soon after, perhaps TSX uplisting. Progress is being made. Was glad to be able to increase my share count. Holding for the long haul.,2022-03-04T11:54:41Z
