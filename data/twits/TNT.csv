Although Tenet is not a Chinese company and the Nasdaq&#39;s listing is a big deal, I think the  Hong Kong one is bigger. Remember that, in 2024, half of the revenue still will be originated from China.,2021-12-10T23:15:55Z
$VSQTF this will sneak past $2+ by Q1. Just needs to hit more radars. Unbelievable set up for large run. Reminds me of Peak Fintech now called Tenet fintech group $AABB  $PKKFF $TNT $DSGT $FUNFF,2021-12-10T22:53:02Z

$TNT  I guess nobody is selling today.   Up and down 5% on virtually no volume means nothing.... Onto next week.  

1)  Nasdaq listing
2)  logo and site rebranding
3)   Canada launch,2021-12-10T17:59:44Z
$TNT if we don&#39;t get on NASDAQ say farewell to this being a 10xer,2021-12-10T17:24:21Z
$TNT Extremely low volume. Insignificant short action only trying to create the illusion of falling sp. Pathetic!,2021-12-10T17:14:53Z

$TNT Take a minute to understand where Peak is on the S-curve and look at the influence it will have spanning from SME‚Äôs ‚û°Ô∏è Banks ‚û°Ô∏è Global leaders ‚û°Ô∏è Countries.  TNT, if executed properly will be like the ultimate Christmas gift - a gift that keeps on giving to its shareholders.  The attached video is 1 year old but so worth watching.

$TNT Good thing is Tenet Fintech is not responsible for the time it takes to uplist.. it‚Äôs all SEC there is nothing Tenet Fintech can do to speed it up‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt blame them,2021-12-10T13:54:14Z
$TNT There must be only working people above 85 of age working at the SEC,2021-12-10T13:48:37Z
$TNT I just want to call and scream at the SEC to say hurry up why are you taking so long for a few changes just 2-3 changes in F40 coming what a bunch of slow turtles,2021-12-10T13:47:47Z
$TNT This is big

Good morning everybody,2021-12-10T13:03:11Z
$TNT  So just to put this deal into perspective...

  Will take a little while to get a machine into each of the 20000 stores (into 2022 as per the NR).  Once they are all set up,,,,  even if Tenet ONLY makes 5 dollars per day from each machine per store that is a cool 36 mill per year just from this little tidbit addition.

  Now I have no clue what they would make at all but 5 bucks isn&#39;t very many of the coffees sold going to Tenet.  Not to mention any advertisement revenue.,2021-12-10T12:58:20Z
$TNT  Is like a Business Visa or MC...get a percent of each transaction and when the transactions are huge..more $$ towards our bottom line, more products, businesses = exponential growth!  Great to be in the front row of this future little Giant. Each Partnership with huge company is another revenue stream...Hard not to be excited about TNT&#39;s future!,2021-12-10T06:18:08Z
$TNT is the good stuff!,2021-12-10T05:07:15Z

$TNT one of Tenants new business verticals is oil and gas. What are the chances they also have deals lined up for financing gas purchases with these 20,000 stations?,2021-12-09T22:49:19Z
$TNT Great day today.. many people are selling their stocks for tax purposes obviously that would be a serious mistake here:-),2021-12-09T21:24:13Z
$TNT I bought more today. Couldn&#39;t stop myself..,2021-12-09T21:21:03Z
