$TNT For my last post. I would already be super happy with hitting the guidance everything on top of that is just extra!! I would be excited to see $39 million and you should too!,2022-01-17T21:18:15Z
$TNT Q4 is going to be extremely interesting we had for Q3 the Consumer goods with $25M and a little insurance revenues. Now 2 events in total of $17,7 let’s stay conservative and the revenues will be lower for consumer goods.
Just to stay safe with $20 million. We would have 37,7 million so we need $0.8 million to hit guidance of $38,5M. Insurance platform running, steel platform running, oil platform running but feel they were all at the beginning in Q4
but feel they are going to bring in at least $5 million I like to stay super super conservative. That’s already $42,7 If consumer goods is $2.5 million higher we are already at $45 million! I would be damn happy with $45 million,2022-01-17T21:05:11Z

$TNT another additional macro bit to the morons that thought Evergrande fiasco sinks China--- China will be cutting rates to spur growth in 2022. Lol... 

Like I said -- kick the can down the road and the thing is the can be kicked for longer than you can rationalize. 

Apply that to Tenet. People on the board can recall that I predicted that during the FUD. 

Our own Fed rate hikes what do you think it&#39;s going to be guys? A small nudge .25% that will create some instant volatility but fundamentally is a nothing burger or a 5% nuke like FUD says? During an election year no less with the current party in power in damage control mode. 

A hike or set of hikes is coming but I&#39;d bet on negligible. 

Doomsday bears are always wrong.,2022-01-17T17:28:31Z
$TNT comparisons to Dotcon bubble are retail idiocy for two reasons--- #1 diff world and set of economics and #2 was 100X overvalued junk co&#39;s pre-tech boom.

Now is wildly beaten down low valuations in incredible co&#39;s and crypto in a high inflation environment that isnt going to be meaningfully curbed. 

Any long term recession will be everything not technology, so K shaped and a divergence. 

Fintech, crypto and essential infrastructure big tech is going nowhere. 

Now, TradFi, real estate and old economy you can project whatever you&#39;d like.,2022-01-17T17:23:50Z

$TNT  With Tenet building these verticals,  the platforms will be all ready for countries other then China as well.  The key sectors that Tenet is identifying and rapidly moving into are global.    Primed and ready.,2022-01-17T13:10:33Z

I foresee the clean energy vertical being massive in China.  Not necessarily 100% for pollution reasons as it is to have sustainable power infrastructure and be a lot less reliant on importing coal.        lol,2022-01-17T12:46:20Z

During this covid stretch we have still been increasing our revenue and earnings, it may go on longer but with herd immunity and more and more vaccinations / also people getting it and recovering it should go away.  
  
   I think we will see extra growth for Tenet as the economy recovers as there will be a huge demand for business funds, oil and gas, things like cars (insurance),  products in general sold by our partners and the social influencers that use Tenet&#39;s Business Hub.,2022-01-17T12:35:54Z

The technical rating of $TNT is bad and it also does not present a quality setup at the moment. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/TNT/technical-analysis?key=690bddba-1b63-4685-a193-eb53e75e1267&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=TA&amp;utm_content=TNT&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-01-16T23:13:00Z

$TNT To anyone who is unhappy with SF and their new paid service... its not enough that u decide not to pay the $35. LEAVE THEIR SERVER. They could be profiting from the number of &quot;members&quot; that they have in their discord. Despite 99% of those people being free users.

Not like there is anything left to gain by being in it,2022-01-16T21:26:14Z
$TNT Just joined Stockfam discord group its so good in there!!! I asked what are peoples thoughts on the current Nasdaq relisting delay and got ban! I should have posted an article on China&#39;s GDP and how it could connect to Tenet. Highly recommend the paid pumper discord!,2022-01-16T20:44:25Z
