$TNT Anybody having trouble loading @Stocktwits,2022-02-15T22:36:38Z
$TNT upst absolutely flying. This will be us in a year..,2022-02-15T21:28:52Z
$TNT wow look at Upstart. They absolutely crushed earnings. This model that UPST and Tenet use for loan procurement is the future. Very easy to see this,2022-02-15T21:28:37Z
$TNT lmfao. Upstart goes crazy. We are stuck. Macro and industry wide issues have nothing to do with this collapse. This is a junk company.,2022-02-15T21:15:51Z
$TNT  @ Johnny  ,  looks more like not much for sells but low bids at work actually.,2022-02-15T19:24:42Z
$TNT Seems like they let this get bought up each morning from the people that want &quot;cheap shares&quot; then the people that want to dump theirs start unloading in the afternoon. Like clock work.  
 
I&#39;m going to be forced to average down, but still doesn&#39;t look like time yet.,2022-02-15T19:21:58Z
$TNT did we finally hit over sold territory yesterday haha hope so! lets bounce this hard and burn the shorts to the ground 💪🏻 Nasdaq hopefully soon lfgooooooo,2022-02-15T15:41:29Z
$TNT Nice bounce today.  Now imagine what will happen when the SEC signs off on the registration?,2022-02-15T15:36:55Z
$TNT Thank you for the shares this morning. Wish i could buy more.,2022-02-15T15:23:48Z
$TNT  i have to do some more research later this week when i have some more time but it seems like the number of Canadian companies that filed a 40FR12B/A likely had 99.9% of getting approved by NYSE/Nasdaq..... ones like NexTechAR where they got absolutely no response at all are the ones that gets rejected.    
 
Either you start nibbling like me or you chase later at $6+.  Your call.,2022-02-15T15:06:19Z
$TNT,2022-02-15T14:55:48Z
$TNT Everybody got their lube ready today?,2022-02-15T14:34:06Z
$TNT  lots of money on the sidelines waiting ...... including cubeler owner and long ed vranic who was waiting for Feb 15th ... will be interesting to see if he goes all in or dca it.,2022-02-15T14:26:33Z
$TNT ready to slap that ask if it stays under 4.5....,2022-02-15T14:21:43Z
$TNT week of 24th!,2022-02-15T13:51:05Z
$TNT The company has nothing to do with this drop it&#39;s the market and SEC that&#39;s taking their time. Business is winning on all fronts. The stock is not the company and long term the stock price will follow the fundamentals. Only thing we have to do is stay patient. Bashers here are silly trying to get Tenet in negative daylight when it is actually the stock that is dropping and out of their hands what in their hands Is killing it on all fronts with the business segments. Growing 100%+ easy year and already profitable.,2022-02-15T07:54:10Z
$TNT  Not sure how many times this point has to be made for it to sink in.  This play is going to require a little more patience for our buddies the SEC to finish their long, drawn out bs and to get a couple seller quarters under the belt.  It&#39;s going to be volatile as hell  like this until then.  Can either keep looking at it all day long everyday and end up selling for a loss or hang in there for a few months.  Up to you...,2022-02-15T06:46:13Z
$TNT approximately 45 days till FY2021 results and then approximately another 45 days till Q1 2022 results. Exciting next 3 months to look forward to.,2022-02-15T06:46:00Z
$TNT I feel sick,2022-02-15T06:17:25Z
$TNT the one thing that is concerning me is how fast it’s breaking through all these support levels, the stock price stayed between $5-$6 per share from Jan. 2021 - May 2021 before it dropped below $5 briefly and then rebounded to ATH’s we just smashed through the $5 range in less than a month and looks like we are on our way to $3 now even faster, any insight from the investors who’ve been here a lot longer than me? Honest question not trying to stir the pot,2022-02-15T04:02:56Z
$TNT Great company, trash stock,2022-02-15T01:41:55Z
$TNT 🚀🚀🚀,2022-02-14T23:57:12Z
$TNT paid pumpers 👇🏽👇🏽,2022-02-14T23:21:02Z
$TNT  i&#39;ve been nibbling a few thousand shares each day....... that&#39;s the only way to play this because when it comes, it&#39;ll come out of nowhere.  ... could be tomorrow, or next week. No one knows,2022-02-14T21:53:48Z
$TNT added again several times today. Didn&#39;t get the low but super happy to add at these bargain basement levels. Might add more this week,2022-02-14T21:53:34Z
$TNT Still on OTCBB..... oh man i do love this s h i t..... 3$ getting closer and closer. LOL,2022-02-14T21:43:17Z
$TNT can’t wait to see the bad news. We are owed that much,2022-02-14T21:36:42Z
$TNT oops I did add again. I really did try to contain myself, but just couldn´t resist...,2022-02-14T20:58:51Z
