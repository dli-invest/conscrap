Perhaps the biggest partnership of all is with ShopEx, China’s leading ecommerce software
provider. Think Shopify or Square, but bigger. ShopEx&#39;s solutions are used by retailers on
Alibaba, JD.com, Tik Tok, Pinduoduo and 24 other online marketplaces and social media
platforms across the country. Even major foreign corporations like Apple, Bosch and
Lululemon partner with ShopEx. 

“The strategic partnership between Peak and ShopEx calls for an API link
between the ShopEx platform and Peak&#39;s Lending Hub platform that will allow data from
online stores managed with the ShopEx applications to flow to the Lending Hub and help
qualify the stores for loans and credit from the Hub&#39;s banks and financial institution
lending partners. The parties will engage in joint marketing efforts and become
authorized resellers of one another&#39;s products and services and earn referral fees from
one another.”,2021-10-31T20:05:27Z

$TNT For those that have been here for awhile, you will know how JJ interviews as laughs excitedly as he says this is the biggest deal yet… can’t help but think how Ping An may very well become that kind of deal in years to come.  Check out the short video below!

$TNT Thinking about the YouCKU deal, where monthly car sales are expected to hit 3000 in December, and to &quot;at least double&quot; by the end of 2022. Every car sold includes a basic insurance policy run through the HUB. Is it that unreasonable to assume that financing is the next step in this relationship? And then car insurance, via Ping An perhaps?,2021-10-31T12:31:20Z

YouCKU is the largest used car platform in China.

  ARK owns shares in Ping An , wonder if Tenet came across Kathy&#39;s desk on this news.

  Not sure if they have policy to only buy a company once it is a certain size or not. 

 I know she bought Draft Kings on a dip after a FUD short attack on that company(was BS saying they took bets from non licensed regions)  &lt;&gt; And also bought a few China based companies on a recent dip.

  Imagine if she decided to score a couple mill buys up to 15 bucks just before shorts had to cover  LOL,2021-10-31T06:17:24Z
$TNT $TPGY $CHPT $TSLA  I made a post about this fund already but messed it up by not including the ticker. The fund is Baron Partners, Ticker: BPTRX. It&#39;s one of only two mutual funds I own. It&#39;s been around since 2003 and has an average annual return of 19%, the best return of any fund that old. The fund is very aggressive and has little &quot;rules&quot; other than to make the best returns it possibly can. The fund managers can use leverage by going into margin when they want. The main reason I&#39;m sharing it though is because it&#39;s the only fund that I know of that holds SpaceX. It&#39;s the fourth largest holding. So if you want some exposure to SpaceX before they actually go public, this is your chance. I also use this fund to get my Tesla exposure. I&#39;ve been in it for a year now. Plan on holding very long term however.,2021-10-31T01:25:14Z

$TNT Genuinely excited for the Tenet name change, website launch and rebranding this Monday.  Certainly looking forward to reviewing the web content and seeing if there are new nuggets of information on there.  I’m fully expecting the Nasdaq up-list this week… it’s been way too long.
