$TNT I‚Äôll be the first to admit I didn‚Äôt see the SP dropping to $6 but having said that I put a portion of every paycheque aside to buy more shares and average down because I believe this is a great company with very good growth and value potential, I honestly don‚Äôt believe there is anything wrong with Tenet so to speak, they are executing and doing very well (ex. 12/12 revenues) rather the sector and tech in general has been getting hammered, I looked up JMIA MARA and UPST for examples of this to name a few, 1-2 yr hold minimum and we will all be rewarded very well IMHO üçª,2022-01-06T00:47:54Z
$TNT I received so much hate messages for saying the macro environment was going to start going sideways mid December on‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll here you have it. It went sideways. And as predicted affected Tenet SP. I bought some at the low today and if it continues, I‚Äôll now keep accumulating using my profits from the $14 sale. Next time someone tells me to just hold and know what you own lines  of bullshit- because that‚Äôs what their fed daily, I‚Äôll be more direct than trying to educate them. (For those that were kind, DM me for a mature investing and sharing ideas conversation), the rest of you and you know who you are‚Ä¶take a hike with your losses.,2022-01-06T00:23:46Z

$TNT @killmenow  I&#39;m responding to your post with another post for added visibility.

If anyone wants an example of a NASDAQ listing for a company with a Chinese target on their back they need to look at $CPOP

They began their journey to list on the NASDAQ in the spring of 2020. They submitted a revised F-1 (analogous to a 40-f) on 05/13/21. It was approved on 06/25/21 and they uplisted a couple days later.

This is not a quick process.,2022-01-05T21:22:55Z
$TNT has a company ever taken nearly 4 months to be ‚Äúreviewed‚Äù by the SEC? This is smelling more and more like a scam every minute. How can I find out which large holders sold their shares this week?,2022-01-05T21:09:25Z
$TNT If another idiot says this has to do with the Nasdaq delisting or the company I‚Äôll lose it. I‚Äôm assuming all of these companies also got delisted right?,2022-01-05T21:06:18Z

$TNT ..today i have seen my 100%+ profits more or less wiped out,can&#39;t say this last couple of months has been much fun but i havejust topped up some more at $4.90,patience is now the key..just hope we hit the Nasdeq soon and my dream of riches might start to be reality.,2022-01-05T21:02:59Z
$TNT Nasdaq down over 500 pts. Just wow.,2022-01-05T21:02:34Z
$TNT $5 next,2022-01-05T20:58:11Z
$TNT just like during the 4 month prospectus delay I got 1 more bullet left in the chamber.  The last bullet is always the hardest to pull,2022-01-05T20:55:19Z
$TNT This has nothing to do with the NASDAQ or the company. It did the initial blow, but growth and the general market is being smashed hard right now. I can see growth dropping another 20-30%. 

May be a blessing not seeing a NASDAQ listing for another week or two.,2022-01-05T20:50:37Z
$TNT and here I thought my $4.92 buy was good,2022-01-05T20:50:25Z
$TNT Hit that like button if you think I&#39;ll see this same number in green sometime in 2022,2022-01-05T20:44:55Z
$TNT If it doesn&#39;t hold this 5.80-6.30 area, next major support is in the 3s.,2022-01-05T20:35:10Z
$TNT Here‚Äôs your answer to why the NASDAQ just dropped

$TNT What&#39;s happening with the entire market. Nasdaq down like 2.34%...lol,2022-01-05T19:51:37Z
$TNT Form 7 this week right? Anyone know which day?,2022-01-05T19:26:10Z
$TNT valuation will eventually follow the business, people need to follow the business as well to understand where they are both going.,2022-01-05T18:22:46Z
$TNT Amazing that this isn&#39;t even on the NASDAQ, yet managed to plummet with it. This stock gets all the negative associated with NASDAQ but none of the positive when it was hitting ATH&#39;s,2022-01-05T18:05:49Z
$TNT keep churning.... nice volume.

Keep accumulating, you think we&#39;ll be at $6 when they&#39;re pulling in over $800 mm in revenue with over $100k in profitability?.  LOL,2022-01-05T18:00:42Z
$TNT We‚Äôll those shares bought this morning are quite tasty. Thank you. More please more‚Ä¶,2022-01-05T17:57:48Z
