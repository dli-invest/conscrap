$TNT What a day,2022-02-25T01:18:01Z
$TNT just caught up on the day, so nice to see some green. Maybe we can catch some momentum going into Q4 and SEC.,2022-02-24T23:59:02Z
$TNT What a Great Buying opportunity today, not to be insensitive to Ukrainian folks but it was a Bearish opportunity for the Stock Market and to pull a “Bullish Trigger”, though the US Government imposed sanctions against Russia, look for another Bearish/Bullish opportunity as China nears the attempt to takeover Taiwan.,2022-02-24T23:45:24Z
$TNT imagine all the people who sold on Wednesday .. and all the ones with conviction and held on or added… that’s how people make money.. the stock market tends to tank ‘leading up’ geopolitical conflicts .. now we know Putin intentions .. the market will slowly recover and move on.,2022-02-24T23:20:00Z
$TNT crickets 🦗 from the care bear 🐻 crew.. they just hate to see any positive swing. Pile on when the trend is down to spread their FUD..,2022-02-24T23:05:05Z
$TNT What a Wild Ride today, picked up another 6k shares at $2.40.  Oh YEAH!        🧨🚀🧨,2022-02-24T22:42:05Z
$TNT Chip! Chip!

$TNT @chipster1 you might be on to something 😆😆👊💪,2022-02-24T21:50:58Z
$TNT -- Now let&#39;s follow this up with some news JJ.,2022-02-24T21:28:24Z
$TNT +36% on highest volume in quite a while,2022-02-24T21:21:14Z
$TNT   Well so much for those little tester blocks that were seen earlier  lol  Those got smoked out big time,  and finish at the day high too, nice :),2022-02-24T21:02:49Z
$TNT now, let’s see if this was a oversold bounce, or if tangible news is behind this big Green Day.,2022-02-24T21:02:09Z
$TNT wowza101🤷‍♂️,2022-02-24T20:58:26Z
$TNT Whoever got at 2.40 - 2.5 today are the luckiest people...lol,2022-02-24T20:55:55Z
$TNT so I guess we should hope for more wars to be started in the future to kick start the stocks we are investing in? Makes absolutely no sense.. back in @3.30 hopefully we’ve seen bottom finally and this is the start of the reversal 🍻,2022-02-24T20:47:18Z
$TNT Great to see some recovery finally happen! But we got a long way to go. ;) Valuation should matter in the end!,2022-02-24T20:25:08Z
$TNT come on SEC…. Give us some good news,2022-02-24T20:24:31Z
$TNT,2022-02-24T20:21:35Z
$TNT now waiting for the F40 and this stock will make a huge comeback😂😂,2022-02-24T20:20:02Z
$TNT been buying all along from when it was at $2 all the way to $9 and all the way to $2. This should easily be at $25 and once they expand will reach $100 sooner than you might expect. This is my gut feeling imo,2022-02-24T20:17:45Z
$TNT Why didn’t I get more?! 😂 

any reason why?

Is it bc Russia needs China?

Or is SEC News maybe finally coming??,2022-02-24T20:10:50Z
$TNT anything under $4 is a steal imo,2022-02-24T20:05:15Z
$TNT That&#39;s right. Green looks great on you!,2022-02-24T20:01:37Z
$TNT Up 30% and climbing...,2022-02-24T19:59:31Z
$TNT let’s go baby!,2022-02-24T19:58:43Z
$TNT Sanction dislocations on the Russian macro economy will force Russia to lean heavily on China for credit and imports,the cash flow will have positive ripple effects for Fintech operating in China as more exported goods and financial services heat up..,2022-02-24T19:57:42Z
$TNT missed the morning bottom. Still bought a few hundred shares and will keep buying. Oh and here is the link if you forgot to order your tshirt https://www.abcsubmit.com/view/id_1fehe6o0u_1dmj?utm=abcsubmit,2022-02-24T19:56:57Z
$TNT shorts covering, oversold or some know something?...hmm,2022-02-24T19:56:47Z
$TNT ok I added some shares this morning. Good god I&#39;m proud of me.,2022-02-24T19:51:26Z
$TNT @newbie99 couldn&#39;t help but notice you&#39;re awfully quiet today.  Admittedly, we&#39;re still down quite a bit, but the 24%+ in the green should be grounds for slight optimism but you haven&#39;t shown it.  Unless of course you restrict your posts to negativity on the red days?,2022-02-24T19:50:36Z
