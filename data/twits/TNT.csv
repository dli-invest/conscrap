$TNT excited for the new year!,2021-12-28T22:49:22Z
$TNT Just to be clear NASDAQ will 100% happen it‚Äôs a time issue and after that the shorters will comment already taking 3 months so? First they had to withdraw the F40 create a new one, file the new one 30 days period and now file the amended F40 that‚Äôs 3 months.. they will try anything to get it down but relisting will happen with or without them also the stock price will increase a lot 

All the shorts here are trying to create FUD by giving the idea that Nasdaq won‚Äôt happen it will happen it‚Äôs a matter of time not if it will happen. Because it will!

Again this is not Tenet their fault or management it‚Äôs the SEC that takes this much time to review the documents and no they will not get denied because they are not a VIE company they are a Canadian company that will have operations all over the world,2021-12-28T19:54:09Z
$TNT So I&#39;m bored. I&#39;ll share with y&#39;all alittle DD I&#39;m doing and not finished with. I&#39;m bullish on Tenet but I always try to maintain an open mind, evaluate and reevaluate, so emotions won&#39;t get in the way of the right decisions. When I read over the revised 40-F, one risk disclosure stood out to me. It covered the PCAOB which is the U.S regulator responsible for ensuring that auditors of public traded companies are performing their audits according to good standards. You can see, if you compare 40-F revisions, that it&#39;s probable the SEC was concerned about this. As you&#39;re probably aware, the U.S. Gov&#39;t is preparing to inevitably boot from exchanges, any companies that don&#39;t have their audits performed by auditors who pass PCAOB inspection. The risk disclosure contemplated the possibility that the PCAOB may one day want fly over to China and inspect GTChina.  (cont. üßµ),2021-12-28T19:31:12Z
$TNT yeah I check SEC repot web site the SEC is taking their time. Unfortunately, this not a very know company  and politics may play role. On a good point  they will be listed eventually. We shouldn&#39;t be in a big rush institutions computer algorithms are shorting and selling small caps under 40 billion. Also, we got get through the wall of lawyer notification according to them until Jan 18. Hopefully by then we get an update regarding uplisting.,2021-12-28T19:26:57Z
$TNT SEC wont Do anything they don‚Äôt have to, they waited until the last minute to add comments, questions to the amended 40-f and will now let it time out so TNT will be able to relist by default, to say they are slow is an understatement, SEC is a pathetic excuse for a gov agency, and don‚Äôt give 2 sh$&amp;s about a canadian fintech company trying to get listed.. sad reality, it‚Äôs already done IMO that‚Äôs why it says ‚Äúon Nasdaq‚Äù in SEC filings, they‚Äôre just too lazy to make it official,2021-12-28T17:19:04Z

$TNT I really don&#39;t understand all the chattery here. It&#39;s Christmas and New Year&#39;s around the corner and you&#39;re talking about ambulances, a freaking PDF presentation, NASDAQ listing, Upstart... WTF?? Who cares!!! nothing you say or do has the most minimal impact on the stock price or how the company performs so just go hang out with friends and family (outdoors preferably) and don&#39;t be such scaredy cats with your money. PEACE!,2021-12-28T00:25:59Z

$TNT Everyone is overlooking this. And I‚Äôm kind of surprised they didn‚Äôt PR it when it happened , but 100k businesses on the hub ‚Äúas of September 2021‚Äù. Wow, a few people had questioned if they reached this milestone even by November and December since we didn‚Äôt hear a PR. But Tenet continuing to execute quietly behind the scenes. The adoption rate here is fantastic, wonder what they are at as of FY21?,2021-12-27T18:29:33Z

$TNT would the SEC review the 40f and ask for some some small changes in an amendment if what they reviewed wasn&#39;t good enough and they planned to out right deny it? No, that wouldn&#39;t make sense. Instead, they have reviewed it and asked for a few more small additions, which Tenet working with the SEC has complied. Now they review the amendment. No reason to believe they won&#39;t make it effective eventually. Anyone saying other wise has no serious evidence and should be labeled a short lying troll. ü§î,2021-12-27T17:06:09Z
