$TNT who doesn‚Äôt love form 7 days..,2022-02-07T20:02:47Z

$TNT Lol the struggle to remain in the 5s is real.,2022-02-07T16:27:45Z
$TNT Maybe this is the bottom, maybe it isn‚Äôt. Doesn‚Äôt matter, take a long term approach to investing ‚Äúdoes the price I‚Äôm paying now make sense for what will be returned to me in 3, 4 , 10 years‚Äù. In Tenet‚Äôs case you‚Äôre paying a price equal nearly to 2023/2024 EBITDA. Simplify your approach to valuation to gain conviction. Would you pay $100k today for a laundromat business that will provide $100k of profits to you and your family each year within a few years ? Anyone would, it‚Äôs a no brainer, you‚Äôve created long term wealth/ income for yourself.  In Tenets case you add in the growth aspect and it makes it that much more attractive.,2022-02-07T15:41:36Z
$TNT you guys see the crypto rally I imagine--- FinTech to follow. Hope everyone took the correction as opportunity to load up on high conviction positions.,2022-02-07T15:15:00Z

$AMPDF $TNT Tenet and AMPD will be one of the most epic stocks I have bought in early stages everything linking together for exponential gowth! Love to follow this together with AMPD these two are kinda identical with potential and their MOAT. Crazy that these two have this kinda cheap prices and will both growth expontential and be profitable while being under the radar.,2022-02-07T12:06:53Z

The clean energy sector in China will be a massive pillar.  Not just for pollution reduction, but more importantly for sustainable energy itself.  Look at what happened this winter with the energy shortages.  
  
 Chinese coal Imports rose 10.6% year on year to 292.3 Mt in the first 11 months, data from the General Administration of Customs showed. China accounted for 23.4% of global gross imports in 2020, according to the International Energy Agency.  
  
  2021  &gt;&gt;  Chinese coal Consumption 4,319,921,826 tons  &gt;&gt;  1st in the world.,2022-02-06T02:25:30Z

$TNT this price action really sucks today,2022-02-04T22:41:45Z
$TNT I am absolutely dumbfounded as to the price action of this stock.. literally so many great News Releases and nothing.. and still low volume.. Guess it&#39;s down to SEC approval and financials? Revenue should 3-4x and profits should 4-5x (minimum) this year,2022-02-04T22:30:53Z
