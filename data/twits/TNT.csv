$TNT how likely are they going 2 have another reverse split in order to qualify for nasdaq once approved?,2021-12-29T22:20:27Z
$TNT impossible to be optimistic about this. Thought I found a gold mine. Instead just a gravel pit.,2021-12-29T22:09:26Z

$TNT do not listen to the bears and shorts do not give in and sell. no one has provided and legitimate reason why this is not a good investment based on fundamentals. Everyone is after your shares the have shorted and been shorting this since September. Time is running out. Many catalysts are ahead. For me, the one that rules them all is Q4. Meeting and exceeding guidance crashing revenues 3rd profitable quarter. The street will have to take notice at that time and this will run away as all will dip their fingers in (all institutions) Because why not? And the squeeze will be real.... Tic Toc for the shorts and no shares are being sold the more desperate they become with Press releases of law firms and every trick in the bear/short book. Mind you even MM and institutions have a legitimate interest to hold this as low as possible (while not on Nasdaq). Because they will bu the hell out of it when on Nasdaq as 2 institutions already did,2021-12-29T19:00:05Z
$TNT Tja‚Ä¶. 5 usd is coming closer. Will not be surprised if we will touch it before year end.,2021-12-29T18:39:31Z

$TNT Maybe, just maybe some of you will start contacting the Company regarding the share price.  Ask JJ now if he is still smiling regarding the share price?  Then call fat ass Kathy and ask her if this is still silly?  Something is amiss and if you don&#39;t press them for answers then there should be no complaining!,2021-12-29T17:06:17Z
$TNT,2021-12-29T16:49:03Z
$TNT Do you see my point? I&#39;m American.  I bought this stock from an American exchange.  There are at least eleven different stock exchanges in the U.S. Does it sound legal for the SEC to be okay with a stock trading on one exchange, but not another?,2021-12-29T15:58:35Z
$TNT For the life of me I cannot find any rule or regulation which gives the SEC the authority to bar the listing of a foreign security to a major exchange. That does not mean that I am saying that such a rule doesn&#39;t exist. But I can&#39;t find it.

If anyone is off work today and wants to join me in some SEC DD, DM me,2021-12-29T15:37:33Z
$TNT backtested the 200 break, now heading lower. Huge yikes.,2021-12-29T15:34:08Z
$TNT not expecting much this week.  Form 7 coming out next week should be fun.  

Still waiting  for the 20 pr&#39;s coming along with canadian launch.... See the longs in 2022.   Let&#39;s to 2022.,2021-12-29T15:17:49Z
