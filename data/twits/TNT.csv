$TNT  Dear TD. Please back the ticker symbol one day. I miss it.  Love, Wrosebro,2021-11-03T00:20:43Z
$TNT I really hope @StockGuruJr will continue to troll the board even after he covers. Please, consider just pretending that you never did cover, once you actually do. It will make my experience of reading this board so much more enjoyable.,2021-11-02T21:54:57Z

$TNT nice close! üß®,2021-11-02T20:06:14Z
$TNT They gotta get their shit together or else investors will look for companies you can actually invest in. Fintech is becoming saturated this is make or break time. No news on Nasdaq uplisting released from the company, just pumpers saying this week itll happen, just wait for the people finally being able to sell their stocks of this scam,2021-11-02T19:38:27Z

$TNT ATTENTION TO NEW INVESTORS:

@StockGuruJr has admitted he is shorting the stock. Mute him if you don&#39;t like seeing negative posts. He spams with one liners. They&#39;re all meant to draw away potential new investors. He&#39;s a short and should be blocked and muted.

@Johnny_Geezy bought then sold and then re-bought at the ATH hoping to turn a profit. He&#39;s currently holding a bag and very bitter. Mute him if you don&#39;t like FUD. All his questions have been answered. Don&#39;t listen to his bullshit. He will post &quot;BULLISH&quot; then spread FUD. You&#39;ve been warned about this snake.,2021-11-02T17:11:57Z
$TNT how much longerüåöüåö,2021-11-02T16:09:49Z
$TNT any guess as to price action after we get relisted? I have dry powder to load. Thanks,2021-11-02T15:30:35Z
$TNT any ideas why they‚Äôre changing the name anyways?,2021-11-02T15:14:30Z
$TNT not surprised I‚Äôve been saying this for weeks,2021-11-02T14:56:03Z
$TNT Low volume again. Smart money still gripping their shares tightly. Nothing to see here today as far as I can see.,2021-11-02T14:42:20Z
$TNT,2021-11-02T14:32:11Z
$TNT looks like E-Trade is making the name and ticker change too? My account has a number for the symbol.,2021-11-02T13:54:29Z
$TNT I&#39;m officially bored,2021-11-02T13:49:11Z
$TNT  Probably going to see a day much like yesterday,  down on 3800 volume thus far  lol,2021-11-02T13:48:23Z

$TNT should def see sec  approval this week for nasdaq listing,2021-11-02T02:55:18Z
$TNT when tf they gona fix the chart and price in stocktwits?,2021-11-02T02:53:33Z
$TNT I‚Äôm not quite sure why everyone is so hung up on a website for a company that doesn‚Äôt make revenue through their website.

Yeah it would have been nice to have rolled everything out at once but it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre a web retailer or social media site.,2021-11-02T02:01:09Z
$TNT ,2021-11-02T01:43:54Z
$TNT $10 USD EoY. Q3 results priced in with new guidance. Be happy if Nasdaq uplisting even happens by then. Theres big cracks in the armor appearing daily, hopefully JJ can fix them.,2021-11-02T01:38:29Z
$TNT 70470F308 did reserve tenetfintech.com.  It would have been nice to see a new website today but I guess it&#39;s still in the works.  Someone posted that Barry mentioned that   https://brandlucent.ca/en is working on it along with the Tenet branding.   Why they decided to go ahead and do it now ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.  Maybe they were questioned about the TNT ticker..idk.    I know, the website isn&#39;t that important now but I was looking forward to seeing it.  The Ping An news and revised guidance trumps these cosmetic issues.,2021-11-02T01:14:45Z
