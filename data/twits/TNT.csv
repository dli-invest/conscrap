$TNT if you&#39;ll check market wide small and medium cap short sell % its extraordinarily high. I&#39;ve posted about a March forward small cap explosion but that confirms my thoughts.,2022-02-10T02:34:41Z

$TNT big day for fintech. Not here though. Mindless pumpers still havenâ€™t caught on.,2022-02-09T22:39:32Z
$TNT  The growth here is spectacular and the valuation is pitiful by any standard or metric.  What you do with that information can change your life.,2022-02-09T21:16:13Z
$TNT we know SEC is a joke guys and its frustrating but patience. Real money is minted buying low. It&#39;s not by chasing, they&#39;ll be chasing too when things turn around. 

Valuation RN is LOL for the rev this co is bringing in.,2022-02-09T21:11:31Z
$TNT canâ€™t wait to see the incoming SEC pump,2022-02-09T18:09:00Z
$TNT  Man, ultra thin again today,2022-02-09T17:20:33Z
$TNT clearly everyone is waiting on the sidelines until there some indication that the sec is about to approve..... strap on your seatbelts when that happens cause itll be a stampede to get back in,2022-02-09T16:50:17Z
$TNT this seems like a good company in the making just has a bad stock, which can happen. Letâ€™s hope the sp turns around in the next few months for all our sanity,2022-02-09T16:00:58Z
$TNT Another day with no buying and sitting on support. If it breaks here next stop is $3.75-4.00 CDN.  
 
Needs Nasdaq desperately, I really don&#39;t want to see another reverse split.,2022-02-09T15:09:26Z
$TNT would like to see a green day here. Especially since the entire market is green lmao.,2022-02-09T15:05:49Z
$TNT Some shrewd investor has been riding this staircase down while flipping and accumulating even more shares.,2022-02-09T14:05:40Z
$TNT --&gt; Tenet filed the last Form-40 amendment precisely three weeks ago today. It should be coming up in queue. Assuming no further &quot;major&quot; changes needed, the SEC could very well give instructions to re-file, with all PRs from Jan 19 on, and any minor changes requested. If this is the case, based on research done by Richard W on the new (and vastly improved Discord), approval will follow in two business days. In other words, if you see another amendment that is very similar to the last one with updated PR&#39;s, then we are GOLDEN. For now, we wait ...,2022-02-09T12:30:06Z
$TNT  each day gone by is one day closer to nasdaq..... assuming the sec is actually doing some work.,2022-02-09T05:05:29Z
$TNT Silver lining is dodged a bullet getting off of Nasdaq with more short exposure there,gotta accumulate more at this level,tech was unreasonably over valued,load up and wait 3-5 years if need be.,2022-02-09T00:58:59Z
$TNT more added at $3:77,hopeful for Nasdaq relisting within the next week or so.,2022-02-08T21:30:55Z
$TNT we need the SEC approval ASAP ffs,2022-02-08T21:07:24Z
$TNT again letâ€™s remind ourselves that the whole market especially fintech has taken a beating recently, eg. Upstart from over $400 per share to $70 recently, weâ€™re not the only one and actually not even as bad as Upstarts decline, but on a realistic note, SEC approval and a 40 million revenue Q4 is whatâ€™s really going to jump start this beauty! Anyone know if itâ€™s possible to get year end and Q4 financials by March 01?,2022-02-08T21:07:12Z
$TNT pumpers still underestimating what a brutal blow getting kicked off nasdaq was.,2022-02-08T21:05:22Z
$TNT This could drop to .50 cents and you&#39;d still have idiots celebrating buying &quot;cheap shares&quot;,2022-02-08T20:09:29Z
$TNT Stay down just a few days so my funds clear :)  Mmmmkay.,2022-02-08T19:40:01Z
$TNT what an incredible pile of junk.,2022-02-08T19:35:10Z
$TNT how long does it take to read a few documents and make a decision? SEC is so shit scared of China they can&#39;t see wtf is going on on their own doorstep..,2022-02-08T19:33:20Z
$TNT averaged down,2022-02-08T16:52:16Z
$TNT Any Bear still here either had paper hands or got stop loss ejected out the game,the real Bears are now silent co-shareholding longs..SMDH.,2022-02-08T16:29:46Z
