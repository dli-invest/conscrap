$TNT so the excuse went from wait until guidance to now wait a few weeks for the market to realize‚Ä¶ excuses after excuses and nothing to show.. while I‚Äôve been mocked for being right every time,2021-10-24T02:45:31Z

$TNT Does anyone know if the 2022 and 2023 revenues include the potential North America and Europe revenues ? Am here unfortunately not so deep in the matter,2021-10-23T12:50:39Z
$TNT Please don&#39;t encourage negative behavior by participating in a conversation that has devolved into name calling and other inappropriate comments. Even if you might agree with a person&#39;s negative comments, don&#39;t participate. You will be aiding in the self harm of their own character if you do. I wish you all the very best.  Let&#39;s keep this board respectful.,2021-10-23T02:45:46Z
$TNT This investment is in safe hands. One: the CEO and management accepted  their compensation for Cubeler in the form of shares of Peak at a price just under $10 cdn. Two: the company is clearly growing top line revenue and increasing its efficiency!
As for Nasdaq, Hong Kong exchanges- these will come. The longer the stock price hovers around $10, the faster it will rise in time. 
Let‚Äôs not forget the fact that their business relationships are with top tier companies with Billions in revenue. 
Happy holding this gem.,2021-10-23T01:27:28Z
$TNT Oh how the turntables,2021-10-22T23:17:49Z
$TNT:  my educated guess is that since they submitted to the SEC two weeks ago and have not heard a request for answers to follow up questions or for any additional information or materials that the SEC review is in good shape as  we are told this review is about clarifying disclaimer info on doing business in China and the associated risks and NOT about any material omission of fact  nor a misstatement of financials. 

Further I would expect as we have been told that their lawyers are in regular touch with the sec that they would know if there is an issue.  

So assuming they get approval from SEC next week as they seem to expect Peak should be back trading on the Nasdaq as tnt the week of Nov. 1 just in time for the 3rd Q call.,2021-10-22T22:48:48Z
$TNT they are issuing 2023 guidance?
They have a crystal ball or foresightful management that tells them about huge profits increases 2 years away, but not how to submit the proper forms for Nasdaq listing, apparently.,2021-10-22T21:08:01Z
$TNT I‚Äôm in agreement with this post on Yahoo board: ‚ÄúJust a reminder to those underwhelmed by the market reaction to Revised Guidance today... Take a look at what happened after the initial projected revenues were released on July 22... the SP traded sideways and even down for a number of days before the market clued in and we saw a meteoric rise.  Takes time, plus uncertainty courtesy of the SEC.  If NASDAQ clears up next week this puppy is gonna fly.  I think $20-25 in the next 4 months is a very realistic expectation.‚Äù,2021-10-22T21:05:21Z
$TNT Ok.  I&#39;ve been busy at work and getting high.  What is the ETA on the re-submitting of this 40-F thing?,2021-10-22T20:59:14Z
$TNT We may have different views on who‚Äôs to blame or how influential it ultimately is or what the short and long term outcome may be, but I think we can all agree:,2021-10-22T20:35:37Z

$TNT  Massive 416k wall up at 11 bucks CAD  lol , shorts doing their best to hold er down until they absolutly have to cover  imo,2021-10-22T19:48:09Z
$TNT since peak has  always hit guidance or raised guidance in the past my question/ observation is they must have some massive news and deals in the pipeline to grow revenues  300% in one year üî•üî•üî•,2021-10-22T19:35:05Z
$TNT Until they clean up their Nasdaq issue we will remain treading water!,2021-10-22T18:08:10Z

Same trajectory.,2021-10-22T17:36:49Z
$TNT I think a lot of people set their expectations too high these days after seeing all crazy Short squeezes happening, this is a great company with a very bright future, next year we will see amazing profits and quarterly revenues around 100 million.. you‚Äôd have to be blind not see the potential in whats to come, patience everyone, we will, and are GROWING! So will the share price in time,2021-10-22T17:22:05Z
$TNT really excited about the revised guidance. I know it‚Äôs only going to get bette. can‚Äôt wait to see where we‚Äôll be in 2023,2021-10-22T16:49:44Z
$TNT  I wish Peak had a chart like this company.....oh waitüòâ! Time to chill üòé,2021-10-22T16:48:54Z
$TNT Hilarious watching a bunch of retards on here complaining about the dip.

The last year&#39;s guidance for this year was 55M.
We are now revised 110. &lt;- That&#39;s fuckin double for all you retards.

Last October 22, 2020 we opened at $1.24.
We opened at 10x that.

Shut the fuck up and sell if you can&#39;t understand and wrap your head around how Long holding works.,2021-10-22T16:34:30Z
$TNT I hate to be betty buzz kill, but this is now 2/3 major catalysts that have been an absolute flop. 

First we get NASDAQ up list failure, which according to perma-bulls and second hand emails should have happened already.

Second, we get revised guidance. While the guidance was great, it did absolutely nothing because people now have doubts about the company. This is exactly why I said numerous times here that guidance wouldn&#39;t do anything for the SP without NASDAQ. I have no idea why they would chose to release it if NASDAQ actually was imminent. 

I&#39;ll be waiting until IR next month, but this is yet another disappointment no matter how you wan to spin it. 

Do your own DD and don&#39;t listen to the bashers OR perma-bulls here. Its not normal for numbers like this to be completely shrugged off with no volume. Its only retail buying, big money wants nothing to do with this so far.,2021-10-22T16:10:32Z
$TNT I‚Äôm amazed on how bulls have excuses on why every time something big is a huge let down on SP. I‚Äôve been right everyone not sure how anyone can deny that,2021-10-22T16:05:49Z
$TNT well this is just stupid. Nothing matters until NASDAQ,2021-10-22T16:03:00Z
$TNT Needs to resolve Nasdaq re-list before investors are confident enough to increase volume and Peak gets some buying pressure.,2021-10-22T16:02:25Z
$TNT I‚Äôm disappointed in market reaction. I feel like they view it as a bit underwhelming but some smart posters have commented on the short sightedness of this already. Oh well. Enough profits for us to enjoy the weekend none the less! üçπ ü•É,2021-10-22T15:52:02Z
$TNT If all you did was buy Peak today and look away for 3-5 years.  You‚Äôd have a pretty damn good track record.,2021-10-22T15:48:34Z
$TNT for this stock to be up on a down day is very telling. Great news on the upward forecast revision!! This stock will double in 12-18months.,2021-10-22T15:31:45Z
