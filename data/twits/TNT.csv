$TNT In Jan 2021 PKK gained ~65%. Dec 2020&#39;s candle also looked similar to Dec 2021. Will a similar gain occur again this month? ðŸ¤”

The double bottom pattern that was forming is no longer valid, We now have a falling wedge/descending triangle. A move below the lower line will likely signal more short term bearishness, a move above will indicate a reversal in trend. 

A bullish divergence in PKK&#39;s MACD could also be hinting at a potential bottom &amp; reversal in the near term as demand increases and supply decreases

Happy first trading day of the new year, and 2nd to last day of the &quot;Santa Clause rally&quot;.,2022-01-03T14:27:44Z

$TNT  â€”&gt; Canadian Markets closed today; open in US.  
 
Canadians now can add $6000 to any TFSA.  
 
2021 is officially in the bag. Almost a certainty that Tenet met guidance.  
 
January should see: SEC resolution + Canada launch date release + Clean Tech hub launch.  
 
2022 guidance is $345m.  Will we get there? How will we get there? And, of course, what will Tenet be worth if we get there?,2022-01-03T12:13:49Z
$TNT Trading in Evergrande in Hongkong is stopped! Will this have an impact on Chinese linked companies? For sure it will and definitely when it goes bankrupt! Watch todayâ€™s Chinese companies on how it will drop! Will TNT drop? I believe so.,2022-01-03T09:43:47Z

$TNT 7.8 in one day + 9.9 in one day. Will absolutely exceed projections AGAIN! Expansion and multiple uplistings to look forward to. This is an exciting time. Donâ€™t mind the nonsense delay (which has nothing to do with fundamentals) to scoop a bit more on dips. Iâ€™ll keep eating at these prices. No company makes 345M at $5-6 dollars a share with this float,2022-01-02T22:55:41Z
