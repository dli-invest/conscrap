$TNT Didn&#39;t sell a single share since the day i bought it in Oct 20. I&#39;m convinced that Tenet is the stock that I can see 10x for years to come due to their business model and at the rate of expansion. My advice is to block the FUD spreader, they are the cancer to the committee.,2022-01-12T01:25:24Z

$TNT A double bottom and consolidation‚Ä¶.up from here‚ù£Ô∏è,2022-01-11T22:47:35Z
$TNT Proud how the market and investors held today. Would love to see it back up in the 6s/7s before any big PRs but then again this stock can move $1-$2 dollars a day so doesn‚Äôt matter what it is.,2022-01-11T21:00:02Z
$TNT look to me like they are making some very shrewd recruitment in time for the NA expansion. Also I have COVID..ü§ß,2022-01-11T20:53:10Z
$TNT The game changes when North American investors can see, touch, and use the product firsthand.  I also think a major, recognizable, North American partnership will go a long way.  If NA launch is tentatively scheduled for Q1, then I&#39;m sure they&#39;re in the works...,2022-01-11T18:34:29Z
$TNT Friendly reminder that the stock isn‚Äôt the business and the business isn‚Äôt the stock. Exhibit A, ENPH back in 2019. Share price declined from $7 to $4 over the course of 5 months (I believe stock was hit with similar short report/ manipulation at this time). Stock then proceeded to go from $4 to $280 over the course of 2 years. Why? Market caught up to the business growth. Financials for Enphase were similar to Tenets back then. At $4 for ENPH you were paying about $500-$600M for a company giving you ~400M of run-rate revenue, growing about 100%+ YoY and moving from unprofitable to profitable. Today they have a $20B market cap after a large market correction on a run-rate of about $1.2B of revenue and $110M of net income (hmm those numbers sound very familiar ?). I bet those people who bought ENPH at $7 and experienced pain for 5 months as they watched their accounts go down 50% are pretty happy they held the stock. Time in market &gt; timing the market.,2022-01-11T18:18:01Z

$TNT and I&#39;m going to repeat this again and again: 

- Fed thermo nuke the market with a huge rate hike during a mid term election year? 

Unlikely. More likely in fact they do little to nothing and make it look like their doing something. So in that case 2021 saw small caps and growth hammered you&#39;d see the opposite in a reality where inflation growth beyond normal is an accepted reality as the rich arent going to nuke their own assets to &quot;help out&quot; the working class with inflation. 

Know how I know? I hang out with the 1% of the 1% in the SF Bay and they ain&#39;t nuking their own shit to help out hourly employees--- as much as they bluster progressivism.,2022-01-11T16:38:08Z
$TNT my thing isnt going to change here--- the co either is seeing explosive growth and has a forecast to grow in multiples in the coming years or not multiplied with tiny mkt cap and small float..... 

All this macro BS and FUD aside it&#39;s that or it&#39;s not and I have yet to see a bear case beyond &quot;mgmt didnt SEC right PR wahhhh&quot;...

$TNT Posting my response here too @5timechamp, Sean was saying no investor should be making their buy or sell decisions based on &quot;following&quot; someone else whether it be Sheldon or Cathy Wood...the point was to do your own research, build your own conviction and make your own decisions.,2022-01-11T16:00:48Z
$TNT Let‚Äôs go Sheldon‚Ä¶,2022-01-11T15:55:18Z
$TNT anybody catch what SeanK was saying on Clubhouse regarding Sheldon?.   Sheldon is always playing it both ways, he&#39;s being doing that for years with various small caps companies ... Ed Vranic on FB also believes he&#39;s been selling nonstop to drive it down with his free shares.,2022-01-11T15:26:44Z
$TNT this will keep going up for the rest of the week...,2022-01-11T15:23:18Z
$TNT $1-4 range is an easy buy all fucking day with these revenues and projections. Just added another 100 shares. Looking to add way more before NASDAQ update,2022-01-11T15:18:40Z
$TNT the fact that JJ and TNT are retail invested and sharing interviews with stock fam is a little sketchy on the surface level. But then you realize this company is giving average people around the world the opportunity to be apart of something huge. Instead of the traditional way where big wallets get in early and we pick up the scraps. Total opposite. Fuck yeah JJ,2022-01-11T15:17:41Z

$TNT --&gt; I will be absolutely amazed if this falls below CAD$5 ($2.50 pre-split). What will be, will be. I look forward to picking up another $3000 to max out my TFSA and hope to get another $5000 into my RRSP over the next two weeks. I am in no hurry to see this pop again.,2022-01-11T14:52:30Z
$TNT In regards to 2022/2023 guidance ‚ÄúOur forecasts, at least in China, well, it‚Äôs quite easy for us to put forth forecasts and be confident in our forecasts. We work with a number of businesses that have been around for a long long time and those businesses have predictability into what they will be doing for numbers. We can take that information, anticipate our revenue, and then discount those numbers‚Äù - JJ,2022-01-11T14:50:33Z

$TNT &quot;The delay in listing to the NASDAQ will not impact our guidance for this year... we anticipate that everything will be resolved... what we&#39;ve seen from our dealings with the SEC, there is no reason to believe that at the end of the process our registration statement won&#39;t become effective, which means that we should get back on the NASDAQ... The process has been going well with the SEC, the exchanges have been very cordial... I ask everyone to be patient... The process is running it&#39;s course, let&#39;s just let it run it&#39;s course. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s going to be a week, two weeks, a month or 60 days, I do not know at this point. But at the end of the day, I think what they&#39;re doing is a good thing and will benefit everyone.&quot; --JJ,2022-01-11T13:57:32Z
