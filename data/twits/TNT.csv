$TNT 5 pillars of Tenet, 
1-Consumer Goods (currently running in China. Accounts for most of revenues today. Soon entering North America)
2- Oil and Gas just came on line this quarter
3- Insurance just came online this quarter
4- Steel industry
5- Clean tech (surprise info in the near or medium future) in the works

International growth, Canada starting this year end and USA 2022. The future data revenue will exceed $100M+. 

Nasdaq on its way by end of year. New listings forthcoming on TSX, and Hong Kong Exchange.

With 1 of the pillars currently firing - they have managed to grow the business exponentially (over 250% YoY)! Imagine now with Oil &amp; Gas, Insurance, Steel industry, and Clean Techâ€¦no wonder they upped the guidance to $345M in 2022.,2021-11-23T05:35:23Z
$TNT lol i guess the chart is just perma locked here??,2021-11-23T03:17:57Z
$TNT FYI The stock market is open Friday til 1 pm EST. Personally, what a way to kick off your ticker being TNT than announcing once market closes on Friday that on Monday TNT is on NASDAQ. I think that would mean itâ€™s officially Bear Season!!,2021-11-23T02:22:30Z
$TNT @petethesneak Oh look the Stocktwits on version of The Grinch is back. Pete you still STINK STANK STUNK! No the up list is not going to automatically have the price sky rocket, but it will shut you and the other naysayers up. Once it is back on NASDAQ, what will you try to point to in order to scare investors? Nothing. Timing running out Pete the stink,2021-11-23T02:18:15Z
$TNT Do you really think getting relisted on the nasdaq is going to cause a big jump? I don&#39;t see it, subpar Q3 with less rev than Q2 and the fintech sector is getting beat down right now. I personally don&#39;t think a spike is going to happen until Q4 results(if they actually match guidance). You guys spamming this board about the relist bringing you to the promise land are going to be disappointed.,2021-11-23T02:15:46Z
$TNT @cctranscripts @fla You bears rooming together but working at separate law firms?! No one believes your lawsuit FUD. Time is running out â€¦..,2021-11-23T02:01:04Z
$TNT Tenet keeps growing top line revenue and increasing efficiency. Nasdaq in due time by end of year. Good enough for me. Holding till 2024 when itâ€™ll be time to review. Fully expecting 109M 2021 guidance to be met/exceeded, and working towards 345M in 2022. Yes that means the SP would be around $45-$50.,2021-11-23T01:18:23Z

$TNT So 2 more trading days until US market closes? Wouldnâ€™t that also mean the lazy government employees responsible for reviewing the form are off at 5 PM Wednesday and not due back until Monday? ðŸ˜‚,2021-11-22T22:03:42Z
$TNT Funny random never before seen bears coming out of their hibernation.  I wonder why?  Better duck and cover bears, as TNT is going to explode.,2021-11-22T21:57:43Z
Sold my remaining $GME today and will be adding to $TNT and starting a position in $AVAX.X 

Ironically with the two big meme stocks I sold AMC too soon at a little over 100% profit thinking it tapped out and missed out on a 10X and held GME too long--- tho at my buy in price of 117 certainly not bad ðŸ˜œ

We can do better tho. Take a look at $TNT if you&#39;re looking for a gem and Avalanche is a monster like my largest crypto position Sol ~~,2021-11-22T21:35:47Z
$TNT What little volume there is, is on the PKK Canada side. Practically none on the PKKFF ticker.,2021-11-22T20:47:55Z
$TNT Bears, your time is running out,2021-11-22T20:35:53Z
$TNT boring, is it bad Iâ€™m getting used to red days?,2021-11-22T19:15:57Z
$TNT I contacted my brokerage and let them know that it was my understanding that stocks only went up, and because I wasn&#39;t fully aware they didn&#39;t, that I demand a refund. Once they issue a refund I&#39;ll buy my shares back at the current market price.,2021-11-22T18:26:50Z
$TNT  If anyone cares enough to count them all ,  i think we are up to 50 fake lawsuits now  LOL,2021-11-22T18:09:34Z

$TNT What I would really be thankful for this Thanksgiving is a PR from TNT  by Wednesday providing us a date when they will be back on the NASDAQ.  That way, I can enjoy some turkey and BEARS this weekend!  Gobble Gobble up some shares everyone!,2021-11-22T16:40:48Z
$TNT Great place to buy Tenet at a bargain before Relisting happens and there is no doubt we will Uplist. Hopefully news EOW,2021-11-22T16:18:10Z
$TNT pathetic,2021-11-22T16:00:08Z
$TNT ,2021-11-22T15:29:50Z
$TNT Everything is set up to be a blockbuster in February when Q4 results will be announced. By then we will be trading on the NASDAQ. Going from $25 million to $39 million will grab institutional investors attention. Just alittle patience is all that is needed.,2021-11-22T15:18:18Z
$TNT Hate to be the buzz kill but $8.50 to $9.15CAD will be the new normal until next catalyst,2021-11-22T15:11:30Z
