$TNT Cubuler lockup expiration tomorrow. No one will sell. Uncertainty around this will go away. Will reverse upwards imo,2022-02-01T04:12:39Z
$TNT falling wedge setup looks prime for a reversal ..... break resistence at $5.30 and $6.00 and it&#39;s face ripping time.  Any nasdaq news will send it.  Good luck my friends.,2022-02-01T04:10:21Z

$TNT I understand frustration with the current set up and the broader markets to start the year off but if you havent used it as opportunity to dollar cost average in things you have conviction in I dont know what to tell you. 

Analysis about short term issues all good but if you&#39;re long term bearish here you&#39;re literally retarded. 

Next you see Pelosi and Bill Ackman with calls on tech~~ macro BS that&#39;s caused this correction will be in the rearview.,2022-02-01T02:22:03Z
