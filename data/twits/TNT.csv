$TNT IMO, anyone claiming that they can &quot;time&quot; the market is either new to investing or has his/her own agenda.

It is impossible to time the macro market, as it can be detached from reality. It is even more impossible to time individual stocks which are driven by unpredictable events/sentiments.

I had a few successful swing trades in the past and made pretty good returns. And eventually it turns out that I can make much more by simply holding. The fundamental problem with swing trading is the mindset. If you sell easily when it is tough, you will also simply settle with a small gain and miss out the bigger gains.

For stocks like TNT with strong fundamentals and strong investor base, I have no fear holding it long term. In the short term, I can also see +20% +30% days incoming to pull us back into the normal range as 1) shorts need to cover 2) people waiting on the sideline 3) existing investors are not willing to give up their future retirement hope for a few pennies.,2021-12-02T05:23:06Z
$TNT Wow did you notice that bid moments before closingâ€¦helpful to look wide at the broader market and how they get you buying stocks (general comment) only to dump the next day(s). Time your re-entry carefully.,2021-12-02T04:39:49Z

By far the biggest beneficiary of open banking, however, will be SMEs. This is not necessarily because open-banking frameworks offer specific new functionality that will be useful to small and medium-sized businesses. Instead, it is a reflection of the fact that SMEs have historically been so poorly served by traditional banks.
SMEs are underserved in a number of ways. Traditional banks have an extremely limited ability to view the aggregate financial position of an SME that holds capital across multiple institutions and in multiple instruments, which makes securing finance very difficult.,2021-12-02T03:12:50Z
$TNT Has anyone seen this? Are they back or going after another company? From this afternoon.,2021-12-02T02:29:59Z

$TNT Every investor needs their own &quot;security blanket&quot; in my opinion. Mine is that I&#39;m 33 years old with no dependants and a significant chunk of my worth in two mutual funds, well really three now. So if PKK dropped off a cliff, I wouldn&#39;t throw myself off one either. It won&#39;t though. 39 million in revenue for Q4 will send it where it needs to be if the listing doesn&#39;t. Again, just sharing my opinion.,2021-12-02T01:21:50Z
$TNT You know, I play allot on here but in all seriousness some of y&#39;all need to either quit checking the price of your stock every day or switch to investing exclusively in mutual funds. If you can&#39;t handle the stress of seeing your investment&#39;s price swing then you need to reevaluate what you&#39;re doing. Just my humble opinion.,2021-12-02T01:15:16Z
$TNT clowns keep posting from the paid pumper discord group. The steak dinner boys,2021-12-01T23:58:07Z
$TNT A friendly reminder that everyone here is responsibly for their own decisions and money . Itâ€™s also possible to Like a company AND sell or even short it if if you think the setup is right.

There isnâ€™t no rule saying you have to HODL a 50-75-% drop to appease people with a religious infatuation with a stock.

No one here has to go through a purity test to prove your loyalty to a company , in fact usually people that fall in love with a stock are the ones that  lose money. 

There is a better then 50% chance this continues lower over the next month or two. If you want to hold, cool. If you want to sell and buy back, cool. If you want to post rocket ship emojis or turds going down a water slide, cool.,2021-12-01T23:42:34Z

$TNT What a horrible day in the market today. I had most of my stocks in red where Tenet is the one that&#39;s balancing my portfolio. This is holding pretty well in comparison to a lot of other stocks.  I actually don&#39;t mind Nasdaq to wait till end of the year.,2021-12-01T22:24:47Z
