$TNT fast forward to summer and the realization that risk on is superior to cash and this macro dynamic changes. Damn stocks got over punished ---,2022-03-08T20:15:21Z

$TNT  someone please fill my last 100 shares for today&#39;s quota.,2022-03-08T15:58:14Z
$TNT sorry didn‚Äôt mean to spam your board. Forgot it would show up here. Hi to all the great people here tho. As long as they relist this will bounce back in time. They have a decent product at the very least, no competition and lots of runway. I still find it weird that it‚Äôs been taking this long and no communication from company. Like they could have mentioned something small in last nights form 7 release or whatever it‚Äôs called. Anyways for those of you who remember I took a break from all social media for a while to focus on centring myself and just enjoying life more and I was in a funk so I regrouped sold out of tnt at around 6.50$ and went into oil. Athabasca and Meg. Doing better and am able to provide for my tiny princess now. Although my wife takes her cut. üòÇ üò≠,2022-03-08T15:49:17Z
$FOBIF this is what they meant by Fobi 50! üéÇ for those of you who remember the Las Vegas show. üòÇ anyways don‚Äôt mean to put salt on wounds but a little humour helps. I‚Äôll just say that IMHO the CEO has been making too many creative excuses for why they haven‚Äôt gotten the big deals. I guess the latest one is privacy reason? Before that is they were fine tuning and responding to great feedback. I mean it can all be true but in this business you gotta walk the talk eventually. They haven‚Äôt and hence the feedback. I might actually by in on Friday or once sentiment changes around the war. This is a falling knife right now. Good luck to all. I want everyone to make money except for @investorguru. He was a troll on $tnt board üòÇ,2022-03-08T15:40:06Z
$TNT fundementals strong ! Thank god. SP will be fine sooner or later. Way undervalued. Happy times ahead !,2022-03-08T14:48:46Z
$TNT Loved the first couple monthly updates this year, essentially Management has told us that they are meeting / exceeding their 2022 guidance so far this year (with the year being about 20% over). Pair this with Managements history of meeting / exceeding guidance. Essentially the price is where it‚Äôs at because the market doesn‚Äôt believe the 2022/2033 guidance yet, but it will start to as each quarters earnings are posted this year.,2022-03-08T14:37:23Z
$TNT  nice form 7...when spring arrives in a less than 8 trading days  .... the flowers will not be the only thing blooming here....... sunny days ahead longs., very soon,2022-03-08T13:58:39Z
$TNT From the Form 7, it seems some of the speculation on whether the Ukraine situation would be beneficial has been confirmed. The conflict is driving up O&amp;G business through the UnionPay partnership. 
 
I didnt like hearing that they are struggling to find talent though. They should consider posting jobs on yahoo and stocktwits message boards. I&#39;m sure they could find plenty of free labor from some of yall !,2022-03-08T13:41:39Z
$TNT --&gt; Some solid nuggets in this month&#39;s Form 7. Steel and Oil n gas attracting &quot;a new class&quot; of companies. Q1 revenue should be solid. 
 
Financials being worked on. Although a date not given, should be released in about 3 weeks. 
 
I&#39;m out of scratch or I would pick up more shares. 
 
SEC back-n-forth behind the scenes is my best guess. I would assume another amendment will be filed in the coming days / weeks. 
 
My attention is on the week of March 28th to April 1st.,2022-03-08T13:38:16Z

$TNT  Ahhhhh  , feel good to vent actually, been quite a while since the last one ;P,2022-03-08T00:26:28Z
$TNT   Not sure why I even come on here to listen to some of the most infintile, crying little babies imaginable.  If you cant wait for an investment to unfold, and that includeds through the rough patches,  then dont fucking invest.  So sell now or shut  up and wait.,2022-03-07T21:48:29Z
$TNT is there a concrete earnings date yet, or is that too difficult for management as well?,2022-03-07T20:56:35Z
$TNT I thought somebody knew something though. Ah well. I guess nobody knows anything and this still remains a penny stock piece of shit,2022-03-07T20:55:44Z
$TNT Does anyone know what timeline SEC normally takes for this kind of amendment F40‚Äôs anyone have any earlier experiences with this? Wednesday it will be 7 weeks,2022-03-07T20:23:47Z
$TNT rough day in the markets.... thank you to whoever sold,2022-03-07T20:04:36Z

$TNT I&#39;m still in Peasant mode financially but when I get my settlement,this Tenent company is going to turn me into primarily having a swing trader first mentality.Hours,minutes,seconds might be my exposure to companies.The only way I will hold long is with companies that lost 90% of their value over shareholders emotional overreactions or with commodities/Energy out of favor.Every other damn day Peak management was hyping how great everything was going up until NASDAQ delist .Raised all that money with offerings and don&#39;t even have a goddamned TENET website up and running.Im in too deep here to give up but damn JJ needs to either expose the fraud or reverse the BS already..,2022-03-07T17:17:23Z
$TNT   CIBC shorter up to tricks again , driving it down, then the big buys lower,   sigh....,2022-03-07T15:57:06Z
