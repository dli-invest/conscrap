$TNT Merry Christmas to all my TNT longs. See u in 2022,2021-12-25T17:01:17Z
$TNT Just thinking‚Ä¶ I have a friend who followed these hedge fund managers into all these high-tech stocks that are getting crushed and they are severely underwater. 
Why not take a tax loss now, buy a stock that will double your money and help restore your portfolio. 
A couple months down the road you‚Äôve got extra money to reinvest in those companies if you‚Äôre still committed to them.
The choice is obviousüß®,2021-12-25T16:35:52Z

$TNT I promise you next Christmas we&#39;ll be on the Nasdaq!!!,2021-12-24T16:13:50Z
$TNT why I build positions and stay to diversification is because stuff operates on it&#39;s own timeline. Rule of thumb is keep a 1/4 cash warchest for retractions-- which I&#39;ll be honest so many opportunities this Dec I&#39;ve deployed further than I usually would-- other positions mint profits you take some to the warchest and then spread around to reinforce other positions that have yet to hit targets that you are convicted with. 

This has worked really well for me. I never go all in something but I do go bigger than your joker trading gurus suggest. 

Which is another point--- day and swing trading doesnt make you big money. Position trading with larger timelines on large positions and traditional long term investing does. 

Point is if you&#39;re not trying to hit multiples you arent getting anywhere in a rapid inflation reality. 

I dont care what crybabies say on any position I am in--- they always sell something before true price discovery. 

Happy Holidays fam.,2021-12-24T15:58:17Z
$TNT Who was the person that said the SEC had 15 days to respond from the Nov. 30 (the day PKK allegedly responded to the SEC)? Someone here posted it and should not be trusted going forward.

It‚Äôll happen when it happens but don‚Äôt post false and misleading information.,2021-12-24T15:44:39Z

$TNT Stock market quasi closed today, closed on Monday and Tuesday (in Canada) and closed the following Monday. Leaves us with 3 trading days in 2021. The odds of the SEC doing anything is under 1%. We‚Äôve basically got a pause until Tuesday, January 4. Will the SEC do any work that week? TFSA contribution room increases Jan 1st so we could see some demand to start the year.,2021-12-24T13:13:08Z

$TNT volume each day seems to hit a new high. Q4 results will be ridiculous. By Feb ‚Äò22, all businesses need to be cleaned up financially per China.
