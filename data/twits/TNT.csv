$TNT My only regret thus far is using my dry powder to chase a so called squeeze in ATER. This is what I should have used to double down on TNT. This is a forward looking stock and I will soon go all in.,2021-10-25T15:57:08Z
$TNT 500 more shares. Will buy every week until NASDAQ. 
Profits from the Trump trade:-),2021-10-25T15:23:31Z
$TNT  There&#39;s no choice......,2021-10-25T15:20:16Z
$TNT  they&#39;ll be lucky to get avg volume for today....Nobody is selling and so only thing they can do is fish for stop losses.,2021-10-25T14:58:16Z
$TNT,2021-10-25T14:53:11Z
$TNT I can care less about 5% drops because it bounces back the next day or the day after. Between now and uplisting i can care less.,2021-10-25T14:40:29Z
$TNT  just look at the bid/ask to get an idea of what they&#39;re trying to  do.  Dump into the bid and see how low they can cover their remaining shares .... they&#39;ll try to trigger stop losses if they can on low volume.   If this was a selling pressure then we&#39;ll see a lot more volume.,2021-10-25T14:31:57Z
$TNT from Discord group : ‚ÄûTalked to management ..very recent. In close contact with   J J.. HE SAYS sec realizes they have taken longer than expected and they now want only two very minor changes to the Form 40  for the re-submission this week.  Management believes the sec will  approve this week .. the trading will begin almost immediately after the sec approval. Now both the SEC and NASDAQ are fully in our  best interest  to uplist and are cooperating to bring this to reality .. GLTA‚Äú,2021-10-25T14:25:31Z
$TNT dropping again. For real y‚Äôall don‚Äôt know what you are talking about. No one wants this,2021-10-25T14:23:26Z
$TNT just absolute brutality. How is this still so volatile?,2021-10-25T14:19:09Z
$TNT Price movement is a bit of a nightmare. Maybe Grizzly thinks they get lucky the third time. I can already picture the headline &quot;PEAK Fintech - a conspiracy to lower the quality of Chinese food in the West&quot;,2021-10-25T14:07:20Z
$TNT  Anyone have an extra 400k laying around to smoke them with?   grrr,2021-10-25T14:04:58Z
$TNT  Shorties at it , watch out for any stop loss sets,2021-10-25T13:56:13Z
