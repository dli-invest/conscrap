$TNT I‚Äôm no bear, but obviously there is some bad news out there not yet made public, IMO. There‚Äôs no way a stock with this revenue growth just implodes for no reason. Dilution, Bad news from SEC and/or 4th qtr missed targets are plausible reasons. I‚Äôm tired of hearing it‚Äôs the broader market or Russia etc. This is something internal. I‚Äôm in for the long haul, but it‚Äôs not looking good.,2022-02-24T00:08:21Z

$TNT Yadda, yadda, yadda. The sky is falling! Nasdaq, sec, management, etc. etc. Same whiny bullshit from the same morons. Don&#39;t like the company?  Sell your shit, piss off and take your useless attitude to another board. Bitching about falling stock prices is useless.,2022-02-23T21:05:19Z
$TNT I learned something at lunch - TD is not offering any margin on PKK as of Friday - that could lead to selloff if people have margin calls coming,2022-02-23T20:25:23Z

$TNT the odd thing is that insiders can&#39;t even buy if they wanted to at this point .... cause of the pending SEC review.,2022-02-23T19:58:00Z
$TNT Remember when Barry and Fat Cathy said ‚Äúonly a small speed bump‚Äù 6 months ago üòÇ ü§° Those two should be arrested.,2022-02-23T19:57:04Z
