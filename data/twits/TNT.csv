$TNT IR mentioned they would respond to the SEC comments on monday, im assuming this has already been done. Is there no news release discussing the comments, or is that unnecessary?,2021-11-30T05:32:39Z

$TNT I&#39;ve noticed a trend with these lawsuits ads, once the SP starts moving up. They stop posting their AD. I believe we will get rid of them very soon.,2021-11-30T04:12:27Z

$TNT Well I&#39;ve got good news for my fellow Americans. The exchange rate went back up a penny to $0.79 

If you&#39;ve followed the PKK PKKFF difference you&#39;ll notice that a penny decrease will translate to a roughly 5 to 8 cent share price decline on the PKKFF side.

$TNT Sounds like allot of retail investors are surrendering their shares to HF&#39;s and Tutes ahead of NASDAQ. Guess this is just the way it goes. Overwhelming majority of ownership is retail that isn&#39;t lending out their shares and the big guys feel they need to change that before uplist. Makes sense when you think about it.,2021-11-30T02:20:58Z

$TNT I‚Äôve been a supporter of Tenet, but I don‚Äôt see this going up anytime soon‚Ä¶could be a couple more months for the SEC to respond. No one has any control over timeframe. Emails abound from management, but no telling how long and when. Yes the company is growing in the backend, but not impressed with how this was handled by management. Say what you will, I have seen a better management team. I‚Äôll buy back in the $5-$6 range. I‚Äôm having a hard time with the 2 questions being company name change and address location‚Ä¶ what else has been requested? This may be resolved in the new year. Wishing well to Tenet but with a different execution. I‚Äôll be back when there is a direction.,2021-11-30T01:36:08Z
$TNT If Greenlife and Fastcapital keep saying the relisting is happening every week they will eventually get it right. Keep at it boys,2021-11-30T01:15:12Z
$TNT did nasdaq relist happen? nope 
did tenet end up in the red again today ? yup
bulls cheering after another red day, have never seen this much delusion before,2021-11-30T00:52:15Z
$TNT bounced right off the 200 day EMA, which may have very well been the bottom. Time will tell ‚è≥,2021-11-30T00:29:34Z

$TNT you can never go broke taking profits but You also don‚Äôt create wealth by selling a stock for 30-40-50% gains.  
this is the dilemma we all 
find ourselves In.  
When you find a wealth creator stock  they will say you are wrong. When you hold one they will say you are stupid. When you get rich they will say you got lucky.,2021-11-29T23:44:26Z
$TNT ; IR - ‚Äú the questions from SEC relate to the company&#39;s name change and relocation of its registered address to Toronto. The company is responding to the questions today‚Äù,2021-11-29T23:32:21Z

$TNT i have done my part. next better player please.,2021-11-29T22:24:57Z
$TNT So checking out what happened today. What I see is that from 10a.m. until 2p.m. we gained almost 17%? Sounds normal. 
(That&#39;s sarcasm BTW)
You can let these shorts shake you out of your shares if you want. I don&#39;t mind the wait.  In my opinion the short is playing a dangerous game. Another big money somebody is likely watching this as well and could switch it up on the short at any moment. That may be what happened today. At any rate. I&#39;m just a small fish in a big pond riding what I know will be a killer wave one day soon.,2021-11-29T22:22:22Z
$TNT Almost time to lose some money and buy? I promise once I buy it will drop another 50%,2021-11-29T21:50:59Z
$TNT Im out of money to buy dips. Think I&#39;ll just avoid checking my brokerage account or Yahoo Finance and stick to StockTwits where its $9.07 every day.,2021-11-29T21:42:40Z
