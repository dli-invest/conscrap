$BEVVF CEO is basically a chess master.  Every move this company makes only increases their market share.  Initial R&amp;D was done well, but done cheap.  Revenue growth is continuous.  Tech makes classic pesticides look like garbage.  Marketing and and focus on customer retention has been on point.  Expanding globally.  Hopefully they don&#39;t get bought out before we see the multi $billion market cap realized.,2021-06-15T03:12:05Z
$BEVVF You know what company deserves company grants and incentives? THIS ONE!
