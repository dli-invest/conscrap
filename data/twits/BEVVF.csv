$BEVVF Once they finish calculating yields we will get a good representation of how well the BVT program worked for the farmers. New deals on the horizon IMO. Looking for some respectable numbers,2021-08-17T19:23:46Z

With all the negative energy and damage caused by synthetic pesticides; we have a superior organic alternative that is just ready to erupt. Wonder what the share price will look like with 1000+ watchers.,2021-08-10T15:32:22Z

$BEVVF Bought top at .34 but I plan on holding this long time in my IRA. I can’t touch it for 20 years anyways. If it drops to .20 I’m going to average down. Another 5000 shares. Thoughts ?,2021-07-08T22:28:05Z

$BEVVF CEO is basically a chess master.  Every move this company makes only increases their market share.  Initial R&amp;D was done well, but done cheap.  Revenue growth is continuous.  Tech makes classic pesticides look like garbage.  Marketing and and focus on customer retention has been on point.  Expanding globally.  Hopefully they don&#39;t get bought out before we see the multi $billion market cap realized.,2021-06-15T03:12:05Z
