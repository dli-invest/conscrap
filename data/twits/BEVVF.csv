$BEVVF Those revenue numbers are disappointing to say the least. They targeted 1mio in revenue for 2021 and ended up with 400k. These growth rates aren&#39;t half as good as they need to be at that stage and this year they definitely need to turn that around,2022-01-30T18:44:25Z

$BEVVF Some big trends supporting BVT this year.

&quot;Investors aren’t interested in supporting more efficient chemical-based technology in farming. Instead, they want to support biological solutions&quot;
