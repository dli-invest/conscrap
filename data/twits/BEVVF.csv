$BEVVF Some big trends supporting BVT this year.

&quot;Investors aren’t interested in supporting more efficient chemical-based technology in farming. Instead, they want to support biological solutions&quot;

$BEVVF What a wonderful little company. I’ll keep my position small and watch the growth long term!,2022-01-12T20:30:35Z
$CWSFF Hey gang, many of you have seen my posts before hopefully I&#39;ve built up some cred wit y&#39;all.  
 
One of my favorite techs is Bee Vectoring Solutions $BEVVF They use bees to do a huge amount of farm-work (not honey) where the bees + the tech replace old-school harmful and wasteful fungicide sprays in many fruits. They are unique, patented, first-to-market and have access to entire markets (like California almonds, yuuuge). They are entering South America an Europe and aren&#39;t dependent on revenues from North American seasons. Green all year.  
Look it up. Set to fly.,2022-01-12T20:29:19Z
$BEVVF Holding long and strong since October 2019. Glad that it’s finally going up again. I hope it remains that way,2022-01-12T18:46:59Z
$BEVVF ...Opportunities include pairing BioSafe biologicals with BVT&#39;s bee vectoring system, and using BVT&#39;s Clonostachys rosea CR-7 (CR-7) strain for non-bee-vectoring applications..   
 I hope the use of CR-7 for non bee vectoring aplication will lead to an acceleration of revenue increacment.,2022-01-12T18:38:53Z
$BEVVF so much about this company is perfect for 2020:

Inflation bet - for food and for farm products.
