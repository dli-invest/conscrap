$ZIM This is obviously the news that drove the share price down today.  Although it is aimed at curbing freight costs, it ultimately will have little impact because it ignores the important role of all supply chain participants, including ports, marine terminals, truckers, railroads, and warehouse operators at fixing the supply chain. 
 
This bill will ultimately benefit, and be very bullish, for the more developed, technologically driven, publicly traded, and sophisticated shippers like $ZIM $GOGL $DAC and $SBLK who already comply with the tracking, reporting, and transparency that the bill requires.   
 
However, the bill will be a nightmare for the privately owned &quot;giants&quot; of the shipping industry such as Mediterranean Shipping Company, CMA-CGM, Ocean Network Express, and others (who control more than 40% of the market) and are not bound to the strict reporting and compliance standards as publicly listed companies.

$SBLK I parted ways with this stock today. I closed my options that I have been holding since July last year for a 180% gain. I believe that the risks are starting to out way the positives for this sector. I also think that a lot of the upside has already been priced into the stock. Good luck to all, I wish you guys the best.,2022-04-05T02:24:52Z
$SBLK $GOGL looking at last year&#39;s numbers, this April should be good to us üöÄ. Don&#39;t let the red discourage you, use this time to load up. The charts and financials speak for themselves. These should rebound nicely.,2022-04-05T01:02:26Z
$SBLK 

I think it&#39;s fair to said this was the &quot;deal of the day&quot;.  Wow! 

$GOGL also.  

These guys are cash machines and rates are only going higher.  Still way undervalued, as we all know.,2022-04-05T00:11:41Z

$ZIM I am just baffled and cannot figure out why all of the shipping stocks dropped between 5% - 8% in unison between 9:30 AM and 10:15 AM EST this morning and then just leveled out. 
 
It&#39;s like $25 Billion of market value was erased in 45 minutes, on no news, while the  rest of the market went up.  What the heck is going on here? 
 
Does anyone have any plausible explanation for this?
