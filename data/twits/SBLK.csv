$SBLK ???  This dip is expected for any stock that pays a significant dividend. So.... 
 
Relax 
 
 
Chill 
 
 
Take a deep breath  
 
 
Buy more if you can 
 
 
If you hang around more than a few weeks (who am I kidding) or a few days for another dividend payout you will see this same pattern kids.,2022-03-14T19:35:18Z
$PDI $BIZD $GOGL $SBLK

Added a bit more.   Not a ton of dry powder left.  But you can never have enough dividends coming in when the market is insane like this üëç

I am playing GOGL and SBLK for Cap gains also but if dividends is all I can get while the market sells off I&#39;ll take it for now.,2022-03-14T18:09:00Z
