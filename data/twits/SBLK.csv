The best and most recent article regarding some mild uncertainty of the near and mid term direction of ocean container freight rates.   
 
Personally, I see them raising in the short term and remaining elevated through at least 2025 (long term because of the new environmental standards being imposed on shipping companies starting in January 2023) 
 
I&#39;d be very interested, after reading this article, where everyone else thinks rates are going.  It&#39;s clear from this article that the industry can&#39;t even agree on where spot rates are much less where they are headed!

$SBLK $GRIN $GOGL love these, but I am up so much today, from my buys over the last few trading sessions, I just have to take some profits.

I am selling most of everything I recently bought and banking some nice bucks today. Unfortunaly, I think this is just a bounce and I will look to buy these back next week.
