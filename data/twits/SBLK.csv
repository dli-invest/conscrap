$GOGL Credit Suisse‚Äôs Zoltan Pozsar has uncovered and extremely bullish trend for dry bulk shippers caused by the war in Ukraine that will cause dry bulk shippers like $GOGL $SBLK and $GRIN to skyrocket for the foreseeable future. 
 
As Russian sanctions have caused an opportunity for China to purchase commodities (wheat, grains, iron, oil, etc.) at a steep discount.  China has since run out of land based storage and caused significant backlogs and port congestion.  As a result, these ships have become temporary storage facilities for these commodities, being paid to wait idly near port.  Even so, this is still cost effective for China, but has significantly decreased the supply of these vessels globally therefore creating competition and driving all dry bulk shipping rates higher worldwide.

$GOGL Why the global supply chain will never fully recover (A Wall Street Journal Documentary released on March 23, 2022).  Dry Bulk Shippers like $GOGL $SBLK and $GRIN will see continued demand and enjoy significant pricing control with continued higher rates through at least the end of 2024.
