$SBLK sold my 26Cs for 140% profit. Thinking about selling my shares. 30 is high.,2022-04-14T19:13:54Z
$SBLK was added to IBD LeaderBoard earlier today.  IBD Buy Range: $28.75 - $31.62.  I&#39;m considering/studying to buy it, but still waiting for some team&#39;s private feedback (or public feedback via Stocktwits or Twitter)...

$SBLK is bullishly clearing its 10-week moving average. The stock showed strength during a broad pullback in transport names and the RS line is turning higher again. The relative strength line has been regrouping after a bullish run from mid-January until early March. The fact it found buyers near the 50-day moving average is a good sign.

Star Bulk Carriers is based in Greece and Cyprus. It operates a fleet of around 130 vessels. It taps the market for dry bulk commodities, including iron ore, minerals and grain as well as bauxite, fertilizers and steel products. Management expects the firm to benefit from a reopening global economy.,2022-04-14T18:52:01Z
