&quot;Also, Golden Ocean expects the global net fleet growth to decrease by 230 bps from 3.4% in 2021 to 1.1% in 2023 due to increasing prices, limited availability of financing, and new emissions regulations (see Figure 4). On the other hand, Golden Ocean will receive 6 new Panamax 85 dwt vessels by 2023 and 1 new Panamax 85 dwt vessel by 2024, increasing its Panamax vessel capacity by 22%. Thus, the company expects freight rates to increase in the upcoming quarters as it expects dry bulk fleet demand to outpace dry bulk fleet supply&quot;,2022-05-08T20:16:06Z

$CMRE just released earnings. Earnings about to be 🚀🔥💯 for the dry bulk/container sector!

&quot;Fundamentals and strong charter rates for the container market remain unchanged&quot;

&quot;On the dry bulk side, the market continues to be strong with smaller ships earning a premium to the larger ones, also benefiting from container spillover.&quot;
