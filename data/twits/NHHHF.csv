$NHHHF Finally some press coverage....  Both of the new Electrification and Hydrogen is of course mainstream.... 
Yet this technology is highly underrated.....   https://newatlas.com/energy/fuelpositive-green-ammonia/

I was amazed at the speed record still being held by tha old jet plane from yesteryear....  Governments talk about reducing carbon footprint, but how many current ICE cqrs, have been made to date, that could be easily modified to run on this green ammonia feul.... I can see this getting adopted in the big shipping liners and tankers, plus for the poorer countries it will be ideal for the farmers and the vehicle owners.... Electric or hydrogen powered cars are just too expensive for the masses...,2021-11-19T12:22:12Z
