Ammonia Propulsion in Jet Engines
With carbon emissions increasingly in focus, ammonia propulsion has emerged as a possible solution for the aviation industry -- though the largest ammonia makers are still in the very early stages of exploring how to produce green ammonia at scale. Adopting ammonia propulsion in aviation would be beneficial for existing engine makers including GE, Rolls-Royce and MTU Aero Engines AG, as well as fertilizer producers such as Yara International ASA and CF Industries Holdings Inc., according to analysts Pavan Daswani and Charles Armitage. - Bloomberg,2021-10-28T20:59:44Z

$NHHHF FP in theory could design &amp; provide the best fuel choice based on the function for the intended usage, quantity and tech of the fuel user...so the question is ammonia your solution or hydrogen from cracked ammonia?

Fuel Positive...your green fuel choice. Boom!,2021-10-28T20:51:29Z
$NHHHF At the end of the article it says ammonia is the future, Fuel Positive will be there in weeks, not years.

$NHHHF For you technical nerds who don&#39;t believe anyone is working on commercial ammonia engines out there, both a new 2 stroke engine (2024) and retrofit kits for existing ones.

My prediction is .20&#39;s after good news on Nov. 4th, .30&#39;s + if/when infrastructure bill passes, 1.00 + when prototype is built by the end of this year, then it&#39;s off to the races once they are displayed in the field in q1 2022 and orders start coming in.,2021-10-28T12:43:44Z

$NHHHF The irony of the stock in a nutshell, we are $0.15 because we have a mkt valuation of $40-$60M and don&#39;t produce revenue currently.

If we go up to $50B valuation, we should be in the $80-$90 range, right?
So let&#39;s say we reach this valuation, we would be 20%-25% of Chevron, Exxon or even Royal Dutch Shell, without the overheads, environmental hazards, payroll, permit process, drilling, fracking, etc. Imagine buying any of those for this price...the real question is will it be in the next 12 months or next 9 years (, NOT IF YES OR NO)?

Seek excuses: no revenue, HC Wainwright, machine not ready today,  SC challenges, dilution, Ian didn&#39;t do this or that, going to agriculture/fertilizer first because it&#39;s the path of least resistance, how much a unit will cost, will it be competitive, the layout of the units has not been published, how much carbon credits will generate, etc etc. 

You&#39;ve already waited, FP will soon release press and you would&#39;ve wished you bought. My $0.02 IMO.,2021-10-25T18:12:32Z
$NHHHF Someone did not like the secondary, whether the terms or the small dilution and is dumping and of course market makers short the stock when they see such large sell orders in the name of &quot;making an orderly market&quot; Will straighten out, but the secondary is really necessary to make the units for demonstration.,2021-10-25T14:19:01Z

$NHHHF I want to know if anyone thinks this could get diluted or reverse split in the next year. What do you think? 
I really hope this grows without those adjustments to the stock.,2021-10-22T16:54:56Z
