$NHHHF FuelPositive, Green ammonia can be used cost-efficiently for use in fuel cell technologies that have historically been hindered by storage and infrastructure problems. Green ammonia allows for increases in power and energy densities, charging speed, longevity, useful life and a lower cost per watt hour stored. The energy density of ammonia alone over any chemical battery is dramatic.

Current technologies commercialized as alternatives to fossil fuel transportation are electric battery and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.

The creation of lithium-ion batteries causes emissions, and the batteries have limited use-life and are not particularly recyclable.,2021-12-10T16:35:36Z

$NHHHF Ok so as of yesterday&#39;s announcement, imo we&#39;re a little behind with our pilot program as its getting lunched mid 2022 and not beginning 2022. Now from &quot;their promise&quot; to take pre orders starting mid 22 and commercialization in beginning 2023 i don&#39;t see much movement in the stock til,2021-11-19T20:15:30Z
$NHHHF Finally some press coverage....  Both of the new Electrification and Hydrogen is of course mainstream.... 
Yet this technology is highly underrated.....   https://newatlas.com/energy/fuelpositive-green-ammonia/

I was amazed at the speed record still being held by tha old jet plane from yesteryear....  Governments talk about reducing carbon footprint, but how many current ICE cqrs, have been made to date, that could be easily modified to run on this green ammonia feul.... I can see this getting adopted in the big shipping liners and tankers, plus for the poorer countries it will be ideal for the farmers and the vehicle owners.... Electric or hydrogen powered cars are just too expensive for the masses...,2021-11-19T12:22:12Z
