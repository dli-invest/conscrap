$NHHHF Ok so as of yesterday&#39;s announcement, imo we&#39;re a little behind with our pilot program as its getting lunched mid 2022 and not beginning 2022. Now from &quot;their promise&quot; to take pre orders starting mid 22 and commercialization in beginning 2023 i don&#39;t see much movement in the stock til,2021-11-19T20:15:30Z
$NHHHF Finally some press coverage....  Both of the new Electrification and Hydrogen is of course mainstream.... 
Yet this technology is highly underrated.....   https://newatlas.com/energy/fuelpositive-green-ammonia/

I was amazed at the speed record still being held by tha old jet plane from yesteryear....  Governments talk about reducing carbon footprint, but how many current ICE cqrs, have been made to date, that could be easily modified to run on this green ammonia feul.... I can see this getting adopted in the big shipping liners and tankers, plus for the poorer countries it will be ideal for the farmers and the vehicle owners.... Electric or hydrogen powered cars are just too expensive for the masses...,2021-11-19T12:22:12Z

$NHHHF so they have to buy an electrolysis machine changing electricity into hydrogen ? These are expensive and I’m not sure there is much supply . Anyone got a view on this please,2021-11-18T19:43:08Z

$NHHHF We can snap this short, no way you announced a working model of the modular carbon free ammonia system today and it only went up $0.01. It&#39;s time to bring some attention to this next generation power play.,2021-11-18T16:14:31Z

$NHHHF 1 more day...guess who arrives early?,2021-11-17T14:34:28Z
$NHHHF This is starting to get exciting with 2022 at our Doorstep!!!

Not only will FuelPositive’s modular and scalable carbon-free NH3 technology disrupt the US$70 billion ammonia industry, but our proprietary production system additionally positions our carbon-free NH3 as a cost-effective, clean fertilizer, a non-polluting fuel source for combustion engines and fuel cells, and as a source for hydrogen. Our carbon-free NH3 is the perfect enabler for the hydrogen economy.

Our plan is to manufacture our prototype production systems in 2021 and launch pilot projects to demonstrate capabilities in early 2022. Our first sector will be agriculture, using our carbon-free NH3 as fertilizer and fuel for farm equipment, including generators. Future applications will include fuel, fuel cells and grid storage.,2021-11-17T14:25:12Z

Cheers!,2021-11-15T19:32:11Z
$NHHHF Here&#39;s the thing. Roger Gordon apparently never sold his ipo to eestor and he owns the right to green ammonia synthesis. Ee store is a grid energy storage company, the question is if they dont own Gordon&#39;s ipo then how will they produce the green ammonia???,2021-11-15T17:19:35Z
