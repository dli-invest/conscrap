Ammonia Propulsion in Jet Engines
With carbon emissions increasingly in focus, ammonia propulsion has emerged as a possible solution for the aviation industry -- though the largest ammonia makers are still in the very early stages of exploring how to produce green ammonia at scale. Adopting ammonia propulsion in aviation would be beneficial for existing engine makers including GE, Rolls-Royce and MTU Aero Engines AG, as well as fertilizer producers such as Yara International ASA and CF Industries Holdings Inc., according to analysts Pavan Daswani and Charles Armitage. - Bloomberg,2021-10-28T20:59:44Z
