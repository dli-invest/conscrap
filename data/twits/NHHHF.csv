$NHHHF One of the things that stunned me was when COO Nelson Leite said they had been overwhelmed with inquiries from all over the world. When speaking of ramping up production he said &quot;...demand won&#39;t be an issue.&quot; So imagine a startup company that provides a product people are crazy to get which also combats climate change and generates carbon credits. Again, not investment advice but at some point the investment community is going to have a forehead slapping moment and ask, &quot;Why didn&#39;t I see this before?&quot;,2022-04-19T21:57:43Z
$NHHHF Amazing Zoom AGM today. The few tech hiccups didn&#39;t detract from the overall effect. Many pieces, recorded and live, from various team members, from Dr. Ibrahim Dincer, one of the co-inventors who gave a very positive committed talk, to AndrÃ© Mech on carbon credits, to COO Nelson Leite providing sharp granularity on what they&#39;ve done, where they are and where they are headed. Wrapped up by Curtis Hiebert, the farmer who will host their first demo project in Manitoba. Tied together by Ian Clifford. 
This is a speculative stock, and this isn&#39;t advice, but if you look at their resource rich website and do your own DD you might conclude like I have they are moving like a high speed locomotive at providing a solution at farmers all over the world desperately want and will combat climate change. All the pieces are there to see. Worth checking out.,2022-04-19T21:31:07Z
