$NHHHF The irony of the stock in a nutshell, we are $0.15 because we have a mkt valuation of $40-$60M and don&#39;t produce revenue currently.

If we go up to $50B valuation, we should be in the $80-$90 range, right?
So let&#39;s say we reach this valuation, we would be 20%-25% of Chevron, Exxon or even Royal Dutch Shell, without the overheads, environmental hazards, payroll, permit process, drilling, fracking, etc. Imagine buying any of those for this price...the real question is will it be in the next 12 months or next 9 years (, NOT IF YES OR NO)?

Seek excuses: no revenue, HC Wainwright, machine not ready today,  SC challenges, dilution, Ian didn&#39;t do this or that, going to agriculture/fertilizer first because it&#39;s the path of least resistance, how much a unit will cost, will it be competitive, the layout of the units has not been published, how much carbon credits will generate, etc etc. 

You&#39;ve already waited, FP will soon release press and you would&#39;ve wished you bought. My $0.02 IMO.,2021-10-25T18:12:32Z
$NHHHF can anybody who knows explain how this stock relates to the stock on the TSX NHHH.VN I can&#39;t find that stock on stocktwits however I own some of that stock. The volume on it today is 10 times it&#39;s daily average already at this point in the day although the prices down,2021-10-25T16:31:35Z
$NHHHF Someone did not like the secondary, whether the terms or the small dilution and is dumping and of course market makers short the stock when they see such large sell orders in the name of &quot;making an orderly market&quot; Will straighten out, but the secondary is really necessary to make the units for demonstration.,2021-10-25T14:19:01Z
