$NHHHF 1 more day...guess who arrives early?,2021-11-17T14:34:28Z
$NHHHF This is starting to get exciting with 2022 at our Doorstep!!!

Not only will FuelPositive’s modular and scalable carbon-free NH3 technology disrupt the US$70 billion ammonia industry, but our proprietary production system additionally positions our carbon-free NH3 as a cost-effective, clean fertilizer, a non-polluting fuel source for combustion engines and fuel cells, and as a source for hydrogen. Our carbon-free NH3 is the perfect enabler for the hydrogen economy.

Our plan is to manufacture our prototype production systems in 2021 and launch pilot projects to demonstrate capabilities in early 2022. Our first sector will be agriculture, using our carbon-free NH3 as fertilizer and fuel for farm equipment, including generators. Future applications will include fuel, fuel cells and grid storage.,2021-11-17T14:25:12Z

$NHHHF Here&#39;s the thing. Roger Gordon apparently never sold his ipo to eestor and he owns the right to green ammonia synthesis. Ee store is a grid energy storage company, the question is if they dont own Gordon&#39;s ipo then how will they produce the green ammonia???,2021-11-15T17:19:35Z

Upcoming Operational Milestones
Company Highlights

FuelPositive’s flagship green ammonia technology provides an innovative solution to environmental concerns and the multiple challenges facing the hydrogen economy.
FuelPositive’s platform is capable of in-situ production of NH3 in an entirely environmentally friendly manner, using only water, air and sustainable electricity.
The process enables small, medium or large-scale production of NH3 on location, minimizing or eliminating the volatility, challenges and high costs associated with storage and distribution.,2021-11-12T15:36:10Z

$NHHHF At 4x the cost of jet fuel, now we now why airlines have not moved yet in this direction. Hydrogen can be mixed with CO2 (e-kerosene) and produce a carbon neutral fuel…we just need to focus on bringing the overall cost down (includes emissions, transportation, etc.)

$NHHHF Today&#39;s trivia, guess what 2 fuels have the highest CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) over the next years? 
Hint: It&#39;s NOT...fuel cells, fossil fuel electric power generation, aviation fuel, LNG bunker mkt fuel, ethanol o bio ethanol.
If you said Green Hydrogen and Green Ammonia, you are right!
Now guess who can help you with that? Fuel Positive!!!!,2021-11-08T15:00:25Z
