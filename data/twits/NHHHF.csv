$NHHHF FuelPositive, Green ammonia can be used cost-efficiently for use in fuel cell technologies that have historically been hindered by storage and infrastructure problems. Green ammonia allows for increases in power and energy densities, charging speed, longevity, useful life and a lower cost per watt hour stored. The energy density of ammonia alone over any chemical battery is dramatic.

Current technologies commercialized as alternatives to fossil fuel transportation are electric battery and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.

The creation of lithium-ion batteries causes emissions, and the batteries have limited use-life and are not particularly recyclable.,2021-12-10T16:35:36Z
