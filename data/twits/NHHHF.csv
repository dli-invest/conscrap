$NHHHF Alex Koyfman of Angel Publishing recommended Amm Power today which is strange because he has been recommending NHHHF for the better part of 2 years, and it appears NHHHF will beat AMM Power to market with its green ammonia, but the green ammonia market is so large that any company which can affordably produce green ammonia will do very well over the next several years.,2022-02-17T00:14:01Z

$NHHHF Very positive (pun intended) news release IMHO. Due to supply chain they are slipping a bit with prototype completion but still expect to meet all 2022 deadlines within the year. A number of updates including new facility, oversight group, and selection of farm for first demo unit. It&#39;s happening, but read the PR and do your own DD.,2022-02-01T15:40:47Z

$LLKKF Hi all - I’ve been here over a year, Lake is by far my biggest shareholding (in excess of 200k shares &amp; I’m holding for the long term). I thought as it’s a down day and you guys are interested in future energy you might also be interested in looking at something I’ve just opened up a very small position in ($NHHHF) - very small, much earlier stage than lake but a bit of research I did makes me think ammonia may have a part to play in future green fuel for heavy transport. Anyway if you want something to do a bit of research on and take your mind off a red day by all means take a look.,2022-01-21T16:27:28Z

$NHHHF Green ammonia,to me imo, could not have come in a better timing as now, it needs to come out nationally so that a country like Canada can become self efficient without being hooked on globalist monopoly gurus.,2022-01-10T12:51:21Z
