$NHHHF Very positive (pun intended) news release IMHO. Due to supply chain they are slipping a bit with prototype completion but still expect to meet all 2022 deadlines within the year. A number of updates including new facility, oversight group, and selection of farm for first demo unit. It&#39;s happening, but read the PR and do your own DD.,2022-02-01T15:40:47Z

$LLKKF Hi all - I’ve been here over a year, Lake is by far my biggest shareholding (in excess of 200k shares &amp; I’m holding for the long term). I thought as it’s a down day and you guys are interested in future energy you might also be interested in looking at something I’ve just opened up a very small position in ($NHHHF) - very small, much earlier stage than lake but a bit of research I did makes me think ammonia may have a part to play in future green fuel for heavy transport. Anyway if you want something to do a bit of research on and take your mind off a red day by all means take a look.,2022-01-21T16:27:28Z

$NHHHF Green ammonia,to me imo, could not have come in a better timing as now, it needs to come out nationally so that a country like Canada can become self efficient without being hooked on globalist monopoly gurus.,2022-01-10T12:51:21Z
