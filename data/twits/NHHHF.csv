Ammonia Propulsion in Jet Engines
With carbon emissions increasingly in focus, ammonia propulsion has emerged as a possible solution for the aviation industry -- though the largest ammonia makers are still in the very early stages of exploring how to produce green ammonia at scale. Adopting ammonia propulsion in aviation would be beneficial for existing engine makers including GE, Rolls-Royce and MTU Aero Engines AG, as well as fertilizer producers such as Yara International ASA and CF Industries Holdings Inc., according to analysts Pavan Daswani and Charles Armitage. - Bloomberg,2021-10-28T20:59:44Z

$NHHHF FP in theory could design &amp; provide the best fuel choice based on the function for the intended usage, quantity and tech of the fuel user...so the question is ammonia your solution or hydrogen from cracked ammonia?

Fuel Positive...your green fuel choice. Boom!,2021-10-28T20:51:29Z
$NHHHF At the end of the article it says ammonia is the future, Fuel Positive will be there in weeks, not years.

$NHHHF For you technical nerds who don&#39;t believe anyone is working on commercial ammonia engines out there, both a new 2 stroke engine (2024) and retrofit kits for existing ones.
