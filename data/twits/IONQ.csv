$IONQ The fact that collaborators such as 1Qbit and Multiverse computing have come out to defend IonQ systems and technology is the best rebuttal in my mind to the short report. 

I‚Äôm personally tempted to add shares or warrants in this case and haven‚Äôt sold a single share. My confidence is in the technical expertise of IonQ hasn‚Äôt changed the slightest bit.,2022-05-06T17:33:32Z
$IONQ Dumped both my positions PM this morning after owning since almost inception. I‚Äôve cashed out gains along the way. Almost bought again at $5.80. Waiting to see what happens but I‚Äôll definitely be here again. This CO. is doing big things!!!,2022-05-06T17:25:20Z
$IONQ It&#39;s amazing how so many people are spewing such negative comments and complaining because the executive team at IONQ isn&#39;t stopping progress all day to verbally address these accusations. They would be responding all day. Simply put. You either believe that soon it will be or not at all. You&#39;re not forced to invest. IT&#39;S A PERSONAL CHOICE.,2022-05-06T17:24:16Z

$IONQ IONQ has something that no other company of quantum computing has: an infrastructure that is still alive and that transfers knowledge and talent in two of the best universities in the U.S (especially Duke, but also Maryland). The university and the company have an alliance of mutual collaboration, mutual benefit. Chris Monroe continues to work hard at the university. Universities attract the best talent in the world, and especially in a nerve center of quantum computing. The university offers its students professional opportunities at IONQ, with which it is closely linked. IONQ has invested money in the University of Maryland, creating infrastructures linked to quantum computing. Therefore, we have not only invested in a private company, the company is intimately linked by a powerful umbilical cord with its university origins. This has intangible value, far greater in scope than IONQ&#39;s current 150 employees. They are actually many more employees and resources that we think,2022-05-06T16:05:40Z

$IONQ For my understanding, the calculation algorithms are quite different from traditional computing. How does it calculate 1+1? The result is based on probability. It seems to voting system. 
The error rate is not simply calculated. If you knows what is the adaboost algorithms. You may know how it calculates 1+1,2022-05-06T15:43:36Z
