$IONQ The fact that they‚Äôll be selling whole new systems in addition to compute time on the cloud tells me that the pace of new generations of system release will start to accelerate. It would seem to me the best ROI for each generation of systems would be to sell in bulk rather than spread revenue over a time frame that would get shorter and shorter. Time will tell but that‚Äôs my day impression of the sudden change in their sales strategy. Another thing I‚Äôm almost certain of is that Aria is not by any stretch their most advanced system. They‚Äôre probably finishing up the multi-core barium systems, and it wouldn‚Äôt be a stretch that every 6-12 months they would integrate a new core and start shipping out new generations of multi-core systems. My hope is that they have thought out the pros and cons of shipping away their entire systems as it exposes it to potential replication of the manufacturing processes by other companies or entities.,2022-03-29T04:26:52Z

$IONQ Just want to make sure I heard them correctly on earnings call.  Difficult to say when one of these systems sales could drop in, but it could come in earlier, as early as next quarter, so they wanted to make all aware.  Here&#39;s the thing, did I hear correctly that a system&#39;s sale could generate 9 figures, 100 million + ?  That&#39;s completely not built into the current stock price,2022-03-29T03:53:08Z

$IONQ Several customers &quot;approached&quot; them about complete system sales--before the sales team could get to them.  Sounds like even one system sale would blow away that quarter&#39;s forecast.  Have to think as well that--given that current IONQ system is 1000% times more productive than last year&#39;s,  and given that the system will continue to evolve--the model could include recurring revenue as well (to keep the system up-to-date).,2022-03-28T23:33:15Z

$IONQ Confirming a 100mm system contract is going to be a huge upcoming catalyst. And remember, with each successive system 10,000x+ faster than the last these are going to be long term hardware partnerships like an IBM mainframe of yore. Also of note, IBM peaked at 6% of the entire SP500 off the back of their proprietary, big iron processing power.,2022-03-28T22:45:23Z

$IONQ &quot;Just getting going&quot; with sales team.  Last year, they basically had no sales team.  Just adding to the head count and putting the team together now, including tackling international.  Keeping an eye out for M&amp;A opportunities going forward.  They have an abundance of cash on the sidelines.  New opportunities for more partnerships going forward.  Companies will need quantum strategy.,2022-03-28T22:33:39Z

$IONQ this conference call was phenomenal. Some stupid asses on ST haven‚Äôt really done the DD or actually know or follow what‚Äôs happening here. Chapman is signaling huge contracts and sales publicly and peacocking the demise of some competitors (most obs rigetti) for technical challenges in their approach. Also signaling meaningful engagement in M and A activity and consolidation in next two years. 2024 is the big year for IonQ. This is 24 months. Blast off could be in 23 with 9 figure system sales - ‚Äúlumpy‚Äù. They are not worried about anything bc their tech is outperforming everyone they even welcome third party validation on Anglo testing. Huge call. Buy as much as you can. Don‚Äôt regret later,2022-03-28T22:28:27Z

$IONQ &quot;ahead of schedule&quot; on technology front with rack computers.  What is new that they have been approached by some parties about buying entire systems (systems as a service), and this would make the quarters &quot;lumpy.&quot;  Lumpy = great.  This is incremental.  Is US government as one of the parties?,2022-03-28T22:21:28Z
