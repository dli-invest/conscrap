$IONQ honestly the rates should be hiked to 6-8%. I think that we will see more aggressive increases later, they don‚Äôt want to say it now but they already came in heavier and markets like it.,2022-03-16T19:50:57Z

$IONQ Take some profit to $IMTE small float, moving up steadily. All it needs is Volume,2022-03-16T17:54:26Z
$IONQ With some parts of the market having showed wild volatility swings recents, and given that IONQ has a best-in-class black swan detection program for financial markets, have to think all hedge funds will be plugged into IONQ soon (and if they are not, you don&#39;t want to be with them).,2022-03-16T17:38:35Z
