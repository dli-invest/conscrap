$IONQ Still bearish on IONQ post lock-up. Sold all my shares prior to unlock at end of March -- waiting til sub $10 to start scaling back in. 
 
This news that GV sold has me concerned. Yes, at first it may not seem like a lot given they are a 10%+ shareholder. However, this small amount that they sold actually puts them BELOW 10% shareholder and therefore no longer need to report any purchases or sales as a large shareholder. Therefore, with that, they can now exit their position over time without any additional filings.  
 
I can&#39;t think as to why else they would sell this small lot at an average price of $11? Why would GV want to even sell to begin with so close to $10 strike if they are bullish, and especially just enough to no longer be subjected to 10% filings. 
 
&quot;.. the reporting persons ceased to be members of a 10 percent owner group and will therefore no longer be subject to reporting obligations under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.&quot;

$IONQ so does this mean that the institutions have decided to sell after the lock up?,2022-04-18T01:41:26Z
$IONQ Got a small short position riding here. Clean break below triangle and support. First PT is 9.45 support. If it breaks that, might test ATL. Currently, short term market environment is unfavorable to small/mid cap growths and tech. This one seems to be in both categories.,2022-04-18T00:56:38Z
