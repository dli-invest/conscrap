$IONQ $NVDA $AMD Nvidia stock opened trading on the stock market on Jan. 12, 1999, at $12 per share. At the time, $10,000 would have bought 833 shares. Due to splits, the original 833 shares would have become 39,984 shares priced at $0.25 per share. At its Jan. 25 closing price of $223.24 per share, that investment would hold a value of just over $8.9 million!,2022-03-11T23:18:19Z
$IONQ $NVDA SOUNDS FAMILIAR. “We’ve always said that IonQ is going to be as much a software company as a

$ARKK $TSLA $NVDA $IONQ Early investors in Tesla and Nvidia made millions. IonQ is the most probable next opportunity.

$ARKK $TSLA $NVDA $IONQ Ark is uninvestable. Only good thing she ever did was invest in Tesla early. Many millionaires were created by early investment in Tesla and Nvidia. IonQ is the next opportunity. https://youtu.be/4V2TrQT1BEk,2022-03-11T20:10:03Z

$IONQ 5% @12.65 stop loss 12.2,2022-03-11T14:58:26Z
$IONQ Picking up 5% @ 12.65. Don&#39;t listen to me unless you&#39;re going to sell today. High probability of closing higher. Only thing I&#39;m looking at.,2022-03-11T14:47:35Z
$IONQ Total speculation here, but with IONQ&#39;s relationship with GE, supply chain issues are so very complicated that I have to think IONQ will be used to address some of these going forward.  Seems like the kind of problem that takes huge amount of computing power to address,2022-03-11T14:30:52Z
