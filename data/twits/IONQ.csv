$IONQ this guy Blake Byers who just bought 5 million dollars of IonQ was until recently a partner at ... guess  who... GOOGLE VENTURES. So let me infer that he knows something and is willing to put 5 million of his own money on it. https://www.linkedin.com/in/blbyers,2022-04-23T17:00:05Z

                    This is a Legacy Call! 
 
The FINAL BOTTOM was either reached Friday or will be put in by a flash dump next week! Either way we are entering the Greatest Bull Market In World History. We know this because there has NEVER been a time in financial history when we have had 2 bear mkts in a 2 year period...until now. And that is the COVID Bear mkt of 2020 and the one we are in now in 2022. Two bear mkts this close together creates historically unprecedented Fractal, Kinetic and Hyper-Parabolic energy to fuel a Bull Market the likes of which has never been seen before!
