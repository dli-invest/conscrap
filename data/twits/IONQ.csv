Why I think markets will  reverse in the second half of the year and this current bear market in growth stocks will end soon.
Markets have already priced in high inflation, higher Feds fund rate and higher oil prices ..the correction in the markets have been ongoing for at least 6 months in the broader market, and at least for 12 months for high growth stocks technology stocks.markets factor in stock prices in advance, well before Feds actually raising rates. So, in the next few months, one of the two things will happen that will make Feds stop raising rates as aggressively as market is anticipating . Either inflation numbers will start going down and Feds won&#39;t be needing to raise rates as high as market anticipating, or economy will start slowing down,employment numbers will start weakening, in which case,  will lead to Feds not raising the rates as high, and infact may stop raising rates all together, and resume QE.
Either way, markets will resume climbing in the second half.üëçüëç,2022-05-02T00:43:06Z

$IONQ teaming with $QS seems a good potential fit. For battery component tolerances and charging systems.  Like IONQ‚Äôs partnership with Hyundai for their batteries.   
Does anyone perhaps know who is QS working with to help run their material and assembly quality control scans?,2022-05-01T21:18:50Z

For some reason, we are upset that IONQ and our other high potential,innovative stocks are being destroyed in the last several months due to high inflation and rising Fed funds rate, and that is totally understandable if you are older than 75 and don&#39;t have the investment time horizon or the risk tolerance any more..but if you are a younger person and have 10 years of investment horizon, you should be loving these prices that market and Federal Reserve is providing.
Just do what I am doing, buy 20-30 shares a week for the next 5-10 years...you will end up with tons of shares , worth Millions of Dollars.,2022-05-01T00:37:19Z
$IONQ I came on here a few weeks ago and said something about Maryland and being apart of the university.  Everyone came on here and bit my head off over, how I was never there, and how I didn&#39;t know shit about the company or UMD.  Blah, blah, blah,

We are going to see the exact OPPOSITE of 2021 this year. In 2021 we started doing amazing buy it all fizzled out. In 2022 it has been horrid but as we progress throughout the year we are going to BLAST OFF! And you apes who have been scared out or are too scared to be buying will have made a terrible mistake that you will regret for the rest of your lives.,2022-04-30T17:12:00Z
$IONQ Glad I sold a while ago. What&#39;s the pulse here? All Hype or a real future? Was this just overvalued on day one or the company is underdelivering.  
 
I&#39;m interested in re-investing. Just didn&#39;t follow the latest development in the last 6 months 
 
Thank you for your input,2022-04-30T15:52:33Z
$IONQ  seriously, will this go to 3 something like Velo and genius or stay or more like 5 /6 like rush and planet? If you buy 3k at 3 or at 6 it‚Äôs a huge difference. At least for me.,2022-04-30T13:20:50Z
