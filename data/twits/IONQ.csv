Fed Will Shrink Balance Sheet &#39;Rapidly,&#39; Brainard Says

Fed Governor Lael Brainard indicated in a speech that the Fed is poised to reduce its balance sheet &quot;rapidly&quot; to control inflation.

$IONQ 
Why I think markets will  reverse in the second half of the year and this current bear market in growth stocks will end soon.
Markets have already priced in high inflation, higher Feds fund rate and higher oil prices ..the correction in the markets have been ongoing for at least 6 months in the broader market, and at least for 12 months for high growth stocks technology stocks.markets factor in stock prices in advance, well before Feds actually raising rates. So, in the next few months, one of the two things will happen that will make Feds stop raising rates as aggressively as market is anticipating . Either inflation numbers will start going down and Feds won&#39;t be needing to raise rates as high as market anticipating, or economy will start slowing down,employment numbers will start weakening, in which case,  will lead to Feds not raising the rates as high, and infact may stop raising rates all together, and resume QE.
Either way, markets will resume climbing in the second half.üëçüëç,2022-05-02T00:43:06Z

$IONQ teaming with $QS seems a good potential fit. For battery component tolerances and charging systems.  Like IONQ‚Äôs partnership with Hyundai for their batteries.   
Does anyone perhaps know who is QS working with to help run their material and assembly quality control scans?,2022-05-01T21:18:50Z
