$IONQ - Added on the dip.  Bouncing.,2022-04-22T19:00:16Z
$IONQ I got so much bullshit 5 months ago when I predicted this will go down deep in single digits again when it was at ober 30. On top of not making any money and quantum being still in an pre-alpha state and really big use cases are still not really there, the overall market situation weighs on all stocks. Maybe this baby willmhave potential in 4-5 years but there are still a lot of ifs. A small position as a gamble on a 100x bagger might not hurt if you donâ€™t need the money. But a total is also very likely,2022-04-22T18:54:03Z
