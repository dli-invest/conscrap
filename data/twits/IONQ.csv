im not questioning that quantum could be a game changer WHEN it scales. i rather have my money in companies that have current/ near term projected cash flows. not research projects. ill leave that to DARPA and the VCs. how much money does ionq have left before they have to raise again. serious question. biotech is trading at less than cash balance. in 20ish months theyll have to raise again, likely at lower price they SPACd at.,2022-05-14T15:26:58Z

$IONQ I will frame this picture, and hang it on the center wall of my living room if IONQ exceeds $100. If someone asks me who he is, I will answer with a short: &quot;a true friend&quot;.,2022-05-14T12:25:50Z

$IONQ Kir Kahlon, he is surely the first &#39;&#39;short-seller-long-term&#39;&#39; activist in history. After studying the company thoroughly and not finding anything relevant against it, he created his report full of falsehoods, dropped the price and covered his investment by earning huge amounts of money, with which he has been able to buy a much larger number of shares for his vision as loyal long-term shareholder of IONQ. It&#39;s a personal theory, but I bet it&#39;s true.  
Kir, you have been a bad guy, but still welcome to our investor community of IONQ shareholders.,2022-05-14T11:45:40Z
$IONQ (2/2)  and for example IONQ affirms that the company will end up being a software company (with the enormous advantage of having free hardware and the original design in their hands for the development of their software team). There will be quite a few collaborations. But in summary, in terms of processors (which I insist is linked to software to a greater or lesser extent), we only have 4 leading companies, and in reality there are 3, since two share the same technology (if one succeeds the other too) . Therefore one could make a fund of 3 stocks, and only if one of the three is a multibagger (and without a doubt it will be), it is already impossible to lose money, but the opposite.,2022-05-14T11:29:16Z
$IONQ (1/2) Right now the two most advanced technologies in the world in terms of quantum are superconducting and ion trapped. The consensus on this is huge. Very probably one of the two will be hegemonic in the short and medium term once the market matures, and perhaps other technologies that are lagging behind today will end up being leaders in the long term (especially photonics and technologies similar to that of IONQ as ColdQuanta). Therefore, if one wants to focus on a multibagger, it is obvious that one should invest in a small cap, and the number of leading small cap companies is limited: ionq, riggeti, psiquantum, quantinuum. I am referring above all to hardware, in terms of software it is still difficult to know the leaders, although QC Ware, Zapata, Xanadu, D-Wave are the most specialized companies now, Quantinuum has also merged with Q Cambridge,2022-05-14T11:28:53Z

$IONQ I find the response of the company&#39;s top scientists as elegant, sufficient, and convincing.
The only thing that bothers me is that they took so long to express themselves, allowing the total collapse of the market value of this company, thus harming all the shareholders who believe in the company.,2022-05-13T18:08:33Z
