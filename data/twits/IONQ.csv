$IONQ Stick with ETH &amp; BTC as much as you can guys. If everyone sells when it start to fall, which at one point it will. The dream may be lost because of it being too volatile for companies to get behind. Just remember where its going and don&#39;t put off short time fluctuations and to facilitates this dream to become a nightmare. The coinbase thing will undoubtedly be replaced by another incident bit it will always correct to higher until it mooned naturally. Don&#39;t give up on it and start day trading it. It will take too much time and concentration. Remember, XRP is probably bitcoin Part 2. It is quite unfortunate that the most popular words lately amongst crypto enthusiasts and trader alike is &quot;hodl&quot;... This concept of &quot;Holding on For Dear Life&quot; in itself may not be a bad idea. But why hold on to an investment instrument which could make you some money, or make you very miserable tomorrow? Making a good profit is easy if you can find a right entry&amp;exit point.,2022-05-04T04:15:16Z
$IONQ I highly recommend people read the Scorpion short report. Don&#39;t let bulls here convince you that the report is BS without looking into it yourself and coming to your own conclusion. Most people here have large positions and are very biased in their perspective. I don&#39;t care which way this stock goes as I exited my position a long time ago during the initial pump. But I caution the blind optimism / bullishness on this page. These guys have a good track record of shorting stocks that end up dumping significantly over time. Do your own due diligence, don&#39;t be blinded by giga bulls that call you retarded if you don&#39;t agree with them.,2022-05-04T04:12:09Z

$IONQ I have very limited knowledge of quantum computing, but I am pretty sure that they are incorrectly interpreting fidelity.   
 
Error rate and gate fidelity are on the opposite ends of the same coin.    
 
IonQ has an infographic stating &gt;98% on Two-qubit gates.  This is does not mean 2% error; you don&#39;t simply subtract the fidelity from 100 to get the error. 
 
Example: &quot;An ex-IonQ physicist provided a more technical explanation for why the company‚Äôs 2% error rate is ‚Äúactually a lot more pernicious‚Äù,2022-05-04T04:08:39Z

Quantum computing is based on probabilities.  When an algorithm is used, an output is generated based on the states of the qubits.  This output may or may not be correct due to measurement errors, noise, and environmental interference.  Measuring a qubit is not 100% accurate.   
 
For example, running an algorithm for 1+1 may generate different answers (as seen in the short report).  But the key here is looking at the probabilities and the **expectation value**.  If you&#39;re able to generate the correct answer 2/3 of the time, it&#39;s considered solid in quantum computing.  
 
This is pretty much spot on with the short report (66% rounded from 65.6%).  Their shot count is 1000 with 4 mutually exclusive experiments.  And they generated the correct answer 2/3 of the time across the aggregated data.  Now, even if this was under 66%, the problem can be with the algorithm, not the machine.  The 1000 shot count may also not be sufficient for appropriate probability distributions.,2022-05-04T02:25:53Z
$IONQ So they are hiring a sales executive who will also work to sell on-prem systems. Why would they post this in the job description if they don&#39;t have systems to ready to ship?,2022-05-04T02:11:47Z
