$IONQ Flipping to green soon.  Tech is turning up, confirming bottom,2022-03-10T15:17:44Z

To REPEAT: The CPI numbers were not all that bad and no worse than expected. The red at opening is just pre mkt shorts getting filled and will VAPORIZE later in day and we have a big chance of going GREEN today!

$IONQ Peter also said that in the finance category IONQ-run programs were able to identify potential black swan events that no other program could identify.  This is huge.  He talks about quantum computing being a superpower, it is also, right now, every hedge fund&#39;s best hedge.  Companies in all categories are going to have to plug into IONQ to identify errors and ineffeciencies, and to protect themselves from downside.  It is insurance.  It is improvements.,2022-03-10T13:09:17Z
$IONQ I&#39;d be a little worried about holding crypto after hearing that interview,2022-03-10T12:11:12Z
$IONQ Peter is not only a super high-level thinker, he&#39;s doesn&#39;t pull punches when it comes to the competition.  Talked last night about the giant fridges that competition uses that take up way too much space and are a work-around: you can&#39;t use a computer in absolute zero environment.  Jokingly pointed out Apple ad that shows a 2042 quantum computer, and it seemed like futuristic version is regular computer-sized and operating at room temperature (kind of like IONQ approach).  Why build all the giant fridges, then?  And that approach has less fidelity anyway.  He also said one of the competitors has a building for quantum, making it seem like it is the whole building, when they just have one computer.  Conviction was super high before, and after last night it just got higher.,2022-03-10T10:14:56Z
$IONQ 16$$$ today,2022-03-10T09:24:27Z
$IONQ at 16mins into the MS webcast Peter Chapman discusses research with GE related to financial modelling and suggests that IONQ own the patents to that research. Part Owning or fully owning IP has the potential for incredible value creation. Imagine IONQ partnering with an early stage drug discovery company to cure a disease for which there is no treatment.  That is incredible.,2022-03-10T08:50:25Z
$IONQ Good morning. Is there any recording of the conference? It was held very late here in Europe (01:45 nighttime). I went to sleep and missed it. Any good news?,2022-03-10T08:17:48Z
$IONQ soon,2022-03-10T08:14:58Z
$IONQ Been playing cyberpunk &amp; I feel alil IONQ up in that game,2022-03-10T05:02:01Z
$IONQ That was probably one of the most profound presentations I’ve heard. Not even a heavy position for me personally but it’s hard to not be excited about the future of this company.,2022-03-10T04:27:25Z
$IONQ 100x coming,2022-03-10T03:36:22Z
$IONQ If you listened to the Morgan Stanley call you are a fool to bet against this company.,2022-03-10T03:30:14Z
$IONQ are the fiber lasers optocoupled  to the rest of the circuit? Imagine multiplexing in combo with the ion trap to increase the computing power mega exponentially.,2022-03-10T02:53:42Z
$IONQ Peter: in the next 2-3 years, you will see people moving from classical computers to quantum computers.  They also wrote a paper on how to crack Bitcoin encryption. E-commerce sites and all browsers are also at risk.  It is Y2K all over again, and everyting needs to be upgraded to quantum.  Even nukes are at risk.  Quantum will help protect.,2022-03-10T01:27:05Z
$IONQ End of the decade thinks they will have 1000 qubits of computing power (way more calculating power than the number of atoms in the universe),2022-03-10T01:19:25Z
$IONQ Again from today&#39;s MS presentation: in a few years, we will have quantum computers the size of regular computers,2022-03-10T01:15:14Z
$IONQ Holy shit.  On machine learning, Nvdia speeds up INTC 15 times faster.  IONQ did it and it was 1,000 times faster (and that&#39;s before linking chips),2022-03-10T01:06:37Z
$IONQ LOL.  Peter Chapman / guy is a rock star: &quot;Competition has to create giant dilution refrigerator that is more expensive that our quantum computer&quot;.  Networking chips and quantum racks coming in path to scale, all at room temperature.  All getting smaller and more accurate, and offering an optical solution.  &quot;We are a very practical quantum computing company&quot; . . . &quot;What matters is providing the customer with a solution that is better that they have today.&quot;  He was working at MIT at 16 on quantum.,2022-03-10T01:01:18Z
$IONQ You&#39;ve got to love Peter Chapman.  Listening to MS event tonight.  Guy&#39;s a true visionary.  Creating the best quantum computer in the world not as an end in itself, but to help humanity solve the world&#39;s biggest problems.  IONQ uses nature&#39;s qubits, not man-made.  Less noise in IONQ&#39;s.  &quot;We easily beat everyone else in the market place.&quot;,2022-03-10T00:53:15Z
$IONQ easily 40+ again,2022-03-10T00:34:35Z
$IONQ  
Nice movement today. 6% gains and clean, strong  finish. Hope you are not running tight stops, hate to see you get get left behind. Next few weeks should be quite nice indeed. IONQ is the future.,2022-03-09T22:56:45Z
