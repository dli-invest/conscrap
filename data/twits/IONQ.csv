$IONQ This will go down until reaching 6$ and abruptly go up to 20$,2022-05-01T04:27:49Z
$IONQ $30, 20, 2......it doesn&#39;t matter. You believe in the tech or you don&#39;t. It&#39;s worth 0 or a possibly trillion dollar company. It&#39;s binary. There&#39;s NO in between fellas.,2022-05-01T04:02:40Z

What is the most undervalued?  Time horizon-5yrs to 10yrs

Any others?,2022-05-01T02:36:22Z
$IONQ 
For some reason, we are upset that IONQ and our other high potential,innovative stocks are being destroyed in the last several months due to high inflation and rising Fed funds rate, and that is totally understandable if you are older than 75 and don&#39;t have the investment time horizon or the risk tolerance any more..but if you are a younger person and have 10 years of investment horizon, you should be loving these prices that market and Federal Reserve is providing.
Just do what I am doing, buy 20-30 shares a week for the next 5-10 years...you will end up with tons of shares , worth Millions of Dollars.,2022-05-01T00:37:19Z
$IONQ I came on here a few weeks ago and said something about Maryland and being apart of the university.  Everyone came on here and bit my head off over, how I was never there, and how I didn&#39;t know shit about the company or UMD.  Blah, blah, blah, 
 
Guess what, stocks in the toilet now, and everyone that was a dick can eat crow.  Should of listened to me then.,2022-04-30T22:17:17Z

We are going to see the exact OPPOSITE of 2021 this year. In 2021 we started doing amazing buy it all fizzled out. In 2022 it has been horrid but as we progress throughout the year we are going to BLAST OFF! And you apes who have been scared out or are too scared to be buying will have made a terrible mistake that you will regret for the rest of your lives.,2022-04-30T17:12:00Z
$IONQ Glad I sold a while ago. What&#39;s the pulse here? All Hype or a real future? Was this just overvalued on day one or the company is underdelivering.  
 
I&#39;m interested in re-investing. Just didn&#39;t follow the latest development in the last 6 months 
 
Thank you for your input,2022-04-30T15:52:33Z
$IONQ  seriously, will this go to 3 something like Velo and genius or stay or more like 5 /6 like rush and planet? If you buy 3k at 3 or at 6 it‚Äôs a huge difference. At least for me.,2022-04-30T13:20:50Z
