THIS is HUGE. Russia is basically admitting they r f***ed and having to run to China for help. But China won&#39;t give those losers anything as u will see. Therefore Putin WILL make a deal to end the war in Ukraine and the mkts will fly!

$IONQ I knew about IONQ&#39;s work with Hyundai to improve electric batteries, but I was not aware of the IONQ application in hydrogen storage for hydrogen-powered vehicles.  The Hyundai-IONQ partnership doesn&#39;t say anything about a hydrogen aspect, but Hyundai does also focus on hydrogen fuel cels.  Not sure if IONQ would own the IP, but hydrogen fuel-cel could apply to buses, planes, trains, back-up generators, cars, rockets, warehouse logistics. https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/ionq-to-present-research-at-american-physical-society-annual-meeting-2022/,2022-03-12T15:23:46Z
$IONQ IONQ now has their own quantum chips + the next step will be, as Peter Chapman says in linked article, to link qubits in one chip to qubits in another chip, and this will lead to unlimted / exponential growth in quantum computing power.  HERE&#39;S THE THING. No one gets it yet.  We are seeing piece-by-piece, but haven&#39;t put it all together.  IONQ quantum computers, rack versions and regular versions, will be coming to market much much sooner than was anticipated.  AND they will blow EVERYTHING out of the water in terms of compute power.  Need to see what is happening in front of our eyes, as it is mind-blowing.

$IONQ $NVDA $AMD Nvidia stock opened trading on the stock market on Jan. 12, 1999, at $12 per share. At the time, $10,000 would have bought 833 shares. Due to splits, the original 833 shares would have become 39,984 shares priced at $0.25 per share.
