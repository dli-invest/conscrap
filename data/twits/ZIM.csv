$ZIM Institutional investors have been adding to their positions, shorts have been covering and of the 8 Professional Analysts covering ZIM the average price target over the next 12 months is $43.83/sh.  Low estimate is $20 and high estimate is $80/sh, so we are pretty much at the low right now.  Buy low and sell or hedge when it&#39;s high.  That&#39;s what I like to do!  My position was complete on Friday with the last tranche acquired at $22.68.,2022-11-05T19:22:27Z

$ZIM I moved all in here today after a couple my other plays popped. Even with a complete economic meltdown I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ll get at least $20 in dividends before they go bankrupt and the odds of them going bankrupt are next to nothing since they can reduce charter capacity and are sitting on a fat wad of cash. Shorts will probably continue their games next week but the patient investor will come out on top here.  .,2022-11-05T03:34:29Z
