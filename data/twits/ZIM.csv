Consequences of China Covid shutdown:

The slight easing of eastbound trans-Pacific container spot rates and US truckload spot rates, coupled with weakening economic indicators, is dangling signs of so-called normalization for ocean and surface transport prices. That those record highs may be over will be cold comfort for shippers, however. 
 
Container lines are hedging any comments on the easing of container rates and US port congestion with warnings that the volume pressure isn‚Äôt letting up and port performance gains may slip again. Zim Integrated Shipping told investors it expected some spot rate normalization in the second half of this year. Yet the carrier‚Äôs leadership told JOC.com nothing was guaranteed. 
 
‚ÄúIt is possible there will be actually no [container spot rate] normalization before 2023,‚Äù Xavier Destriau, Zim‚Äôs executiveVP and cfo, said Mar 9. ‚ÄúThere is no significant capacity coming in 2022 and incremental capacity will only start coming in 2023.‚Äù

Rates are unlikely to return where they were before the pandemic, when carriers suffered from overcapacity and low profits for years, said Stephanie Loomis, vice president of international procurement at freight forwarder CargoTrans, Inc.   
 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs settling into the market now that the days of really very low, ridiculously cheap ocean rates are over,‚Äù she said, adding that prices are unlikely to stay at these levels for more than a couple of years and will likely settle a little lower.

$ZIM so who is treating themselves with the winfall on monday... ? What you treating yourself with?,2022-04-02T09:46:34Z
$ZIM  
Who here is drip&#39;n back into the stock monday, also is anybody trading covered calls on this position. It kinda seems like a no brainer right now (which is seldom seen in the market). With covered calls, you still collect the dividend and you collect your premium, with the best balance sheet I have ever seen on a stock, is this not an easy trade. If anybody has any insight or alternative thoughts please let me know. P/E sub 2, with the acquistion of almost 20 vessells in the past 2 months, kinda seems like they are in a good contracted out position,2022-04-02T01:23:44Z
