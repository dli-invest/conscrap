$ZIM American here, how does the Israeli withholding tax impact my personal income tax situation? Do I get a tax credit for foreign taxes paid?,2022-09-11T20:44:52Z
$ZIM  ZIM is very likely sandbagging here with regard to the value-add of it&#39;s new tech... They&#39;re playing this card close to their chest in order to delivery some unanticipated positive surprises going forward...,2022-09-11T13:50:22Z
$ZIM  Actually, ZIM shareholders would very likely benefit if they diverted some of their excess cash flow into buybacks rather than divs and/or debt reduction... Their debt is materially insignificant, and their divs are very generous... Engaging the buyback machine to enhance shareholder value is not without merit, and could have an out-sized positive impact on the shares...,2022-09-11T13:47:36Z
$ZIM If I read one more person suggestion &quot;Buyback Shares&quot;  I&#39;m going to say really bad things about them! LOL,2022-09-11T12:23:12Z
$ZIM  ZIM here is a private equity dream stock... After cash, the business is essentially priced at zero, which is why it&#39;s very likely that private equity is positioning here... PE generally avoids the shipping sector like the plague... But they&#39;re sooooo starved for yield and deep value,  they&#39;re actively positioning to take over shipping sector operators like ZIM... ZIM has no net debt, excellent long-term cash flow generation potential, it&#39;s trading at cash on-hand, and it&#39;s metrics are showing deeply undervalued forward valuations... Their model is flexible and their structure is streamlined and efficient... But the most interesting thing about ZIM is that the market seems to be ignoring the positive impact of its new technological developments with regard to its platform, which will increase its competitiveness and profitability going forward... Leadership probably needs to provide more color to the quantitative value of their new tech advancements...,2022-09-11T11:56:23Z
$ZIM  The reality in the container shipping world is that spot rates continue to follow a well-forecasted, gradual and predictable glide-path lower, while contract rates  move sideways to higher based on the reality that container ship availability will actually contract moving into 2023 (despite the hype of looking only at new builds, and ignoring extensively delayed scrapping due to excess demand)... The convergence of these factors along with inflation will cause rates to stabilize and form a new base run rate much higher than pre-pandemic levels...

$ZIM is reminding me of $PBR, ie. outsized dividend and low PE. I bought PBR a couple years back when it was an annual payer and they&#39;ve since become one of the most generous dividend stocks around, and has become my largest position, mostly through DRIP almost doubling my shares by EOY22.

Even with a PE south of 3, PBR&#39;s PE is 4.7x that of ZIM&#39;s 0.62. If ZIM just commanded the 2.91 PE of PBR, it would imply a 215% dividend yield from here.

I own $SFL from a year ago, mid 7 cost, and like the durability of income, even while cyclical.

Looking to start a 1/2 ZIM position this week. 50$ of earnings annualized on a 32$ stock is unheard of, plus the dividend and I don&#39;t think PBR even got half this nutty. I want to say PBR had a 1.90 PE for a quick minute but it didn&#39;t last. I really think the market hated the 17.50$ dividend and sought to beat it out of them.

Looking also for a $SCHD starter here soon, to add to a mix of growth stocks/dividends and total portfolio yield of 6%.,2022-09-11T10:09:19Z
$ZIM if the stock is as undervalued as it seems, why are they not using some of that dividend money to do a buyback?,2022-09-11T05:13:06Z

$ZIM if i bought stock between 9/1-9/8 will i be able to get the next dividend ?,2022-09-10T23:28:06Z
$ZIM Shareholder Equity = $5.24 Billion, Market Cap = $3.77 Billion.  Do the math.  If ZIM were to close its doors today shareholders would get back over $1.5 Billion dollars (divided by total outstanding shares) on top of the current share price.  Don&#39;t sell for a loss.  Your just giving money away to shorts.,2022-09-10T18:41:10Z
$ZIM Just remember fundamentals eventually win out. Even with an industry slowdown next year, in this high interest rate (which the FED is saying is going to last a while) environment, cash is huge.  And ZIM is loaded with free cash flow that will help them weather any downturn.  We all know these crazy future projections for all these overvalued growth stocks will get revised soon once the reality of sustained high interest rates kicks in.  Best place to be right now is value, which current ZIM is insanely undervalued.,2022-09-10T18:13:23Z
$ZIM Why does it say Zim pays 27.10 per share per year and yet the latest announced quarterly dividend is 4.75?  Does they divide 27.10 by 4 unequally?  New to dividends and am curious how this works?,2022-09-10T16:51:41Z
