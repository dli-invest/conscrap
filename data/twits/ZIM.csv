$ZIM On a lighter note, ZIM has an extremely high &#39;gamma squeeze&#39; score (likelihood of shooting up because of influx of investment).,2022-04-22T00:13:54Z

The umpteenth analyst hammering home the point. Especially read the last paragraph: 
 
The war in Ukraine/Russia, while disruptive, is not as impactful on container prices, according to Ami Daniel, CEO of shipping analytics company Windward (WNWD). ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think the war has a material impact on container rates, neither Ukraine/Russia are big players. The thing impacting them big time though is the lockdown in China‚Äù. 
 
Data from Windward show that the number of container vessels waiting outside port in China on 5 April was 195 per cent higher than in February. It represented 27.7 per cent of all vessels waiting outside ports around the world. 
 
In the short-term this has reduced rates as demand from containers from China has declined. However, Daniel thinks the large backlog of goods in China that will need to be moved when lockdowns end will create a spike in prices. ‚ÄúThe last time there was a lockdown it took 10 weeks to clear it,‚Äù he explained.

$ZIM Worst investment I&#39;ve ever made. Worse than Ford. Worse than Bitcoin. Worse than RIOT. Garbage.,2022-04-21T20:08:44Z
$ZIM what‚Äôs crazy is this thing ripped as the market tanked January-February-March. Now let‚Äôs see if we can get a pre earnings run up with likely another broad market sell off,2022-04-21T19:59:20Z

$ZIM Shipping went down harder than the rest of the market. Why? Is it being targeted?,2022-04-21T19:35:41Z
$ZIM 0K,Ok, added little bit again,2022-04-21T19:12:38Z
$ZIM Feels like such an easy target for shorts. Doesn&#39;t make any logical sense,2022-04-21T19:12:31Z
$ZIM Given ZIM has at least (from last earnings) $1.2 billion cash on hand, the real price right now is $49.  I guarantee they will have at least 2bil net income this quarter (TEU up 25% since Q4 2021), so that money is already in their pocket. $3.2bil cash with TEU at all-time highs and a $6.6bil market cap. This is insanely undervalued.,2022-04-21T19:09:03Z
$ZIM well that enough market for today lol, wtf and have a good night all.,2022-04-21T19:05:51Z
$ZIM low volume sell off, not that high really only 3m shares meaning probably just hitting some stop losses for those that bought at $55 recently - I loaded more and will happily collect over $100,000 in dividends in next 12 months. Therefore in 12 months my shares bought today will be zero net cost (when you factor in my total holdings:).,2022-04-21T18:45:27Z
$ZIM great buying opportunity. Longs will be rewarded.,2022-04-21T18:44:48Z
$ZIM with this downward trend,  next dividend will be higher than its price... feel good,2022-04-21T18:43:28Z
$ZIM low risk entry,2022-04-21T18:42:02Z
