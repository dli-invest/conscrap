@mike325 @matt6g of course he can&#39;t, because it&#39;s not happening.   The OCC posts memos about option strike adjustments within a day or two of the declaration date of a special dividend.   This is an ordinary dividend that is only &quot;special&quot; in that there is an adjustment to the ex-date due to being over 25% of the underlying.  Go look at the dates memos were posted after any other special dividend, like $F in February.  Declaration date 2/2, memo date 2/3.  After the 2021 $ZIM special dividend was declared, the OCC memo was published the next day.  The last memo on $ZIM after the $17 dividend in 2022 stated that no option adjustments would be made for companies that pay large ordinary dividends, regardless of size.

So what&#39;s more likely, that the OCC hasn&#39;t published a memo yet because they can&#39;t figure out what to do, or that there is not going to be any strike price adjustments, just like they said last time.,2023-03-30T02:48:20Z

My alerts for LARGE caps. I have timestamps + buy fills for everything What&#39;s my win rate?

I ONLY buy when Algos are tired of selling. How? I buy when &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; is low.
I don&#39;t make 100s of trades. I only buy when I get a confirmation. Ask me for the receipts. 

Next, I&#39;ll trade $ATVI + $CRWD + $SNOW + $ZIM + $NVAX,2023-03-29T19:26:51Z

$ZIM You can still receive the dividend! 
 
Because all shares now have the dividend attached to them (happened on the record date) and trade along with the dividend, if one purchases shares from now to any time up to close on pay date April 3, they of course receive the dividend.  
 
Since the record date, one may sell or buy shares and the dividend transfers along with the share via the &quot;due bill&quot; process. The last man (or woman) standing who owns the share at close on April 3 before the ex div on the 4th, receives the dividend.

$ZIM I can&#39;t wait until 4/4. No more. What do I have to do to get the divy questions.,2023-03-29T18:26:46Z
@2beeorNot3g  
Huh?  For all intents and purposes, shorts will have already covered (before ex-div).  By DRIP&#39;n $ZIM (financial institutions will be buying market shares on your behalf), pushing the adjusted post ex-div price higher resulting in you buying higher priced shares.  Once that activity is completed, shorts will resume their shorting  efforts and drive the price down off of the DRIP buying high.  Take CASH, and buy your own &quot;reinvest&quot; shares at the lowest price possible.  You&#39;ll have until the latter part of May to do this.,2023-03-29T18:11:39Z
$ZIM can I sell on April 3 and still receive the dividend? Ex dividend date is 4/4,  I‚Äôm just not sure I think it‚Äôs one day before.,2023-03-29T18:10:44Z
$ZIM There is no guidance at this time as to potential options adjustments for ZIM options in the wake of the upcoming dividend. If option strikes are adjusted, it would be to compensate for the anticipated reduction in share price, therefore ITM contracts would remain ITM and OTM contracts would remain OTM. However, until OCC releases guidance, I cannot speculate as to whether or not an adjustment is warranted. When updated guidance is available, it will appear on our public website.‚Äù,2023-03-29T17:57:14Z
$ZIM IF everyone instructs brokers to RE-INVEST DIVIDEND payments to ZIM stock it will give the shorts no place to COVER!! it will increase your longterm investment and LOWER the tax....buy,re-invest, REPEAT,2023-03-29T17:56:04Z
