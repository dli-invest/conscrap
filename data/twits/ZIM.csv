$ZIM   15% of the shorts as of Friday have since closed their positions...  The remaining shorts are getting sucked-in by recency bias...

$ZIM  ZIM represents one of the best investing opportunities available to public investors in decades...

$ZIM The market seems to be ignoring what appears to be a completely glossed-over statement by ZIM in their last release that they were adjusting their focus on long term leases as the market dynamics shift... This small statement has huge implications for ZIM in this environment... It means ZIM is not just standing still as market characteristics change, they&#39;re being flexible and adapting to actual current and forecasted market conditions on the ground... The assumption that ZIM will lean as heavily on spot rates as it has during the previous unprecedented pandemic-fueled period is a simply an erroneous paradigm...,2022-09-27T00:03:25Z

$ZIM We are within 2 months aka 40 trading days until ZIM will announce earnings and dividends. For the past 4 quarters the stock price drifted up $10-$20/sh+ from 60 days out, until the earnings and dividends were actually announced. Might have to do with short covering.
