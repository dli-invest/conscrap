$ZIM  The target price is still $100. Explanation later, a lot of analysis has to be refuted, which underpriced it in an incompetent way. This takes a lot of time and patience.,2022-11-18T19:41:25Z
$ZIM Fear is costly. I bought 1010 shares this morning at 23.74. Admittedly I was lucky to get them. So, by the end of the day I&#39;ll be up on paper $1000. But it doesn&#39;t matter to me. They are for my retirement income, not for trading. It&#39;s not that I had cash sitting around. Seeing the fall on ZIM, I took a ~20% tax loss on another stock and just rotated it into ZIM.,2022-11-18T19:33:43Z

$ZIM Every commentator now expresses fear about this stock, yet the management of the company expresses confidence in the future, and continues to deliver on its guidance and dividend.  
 
EPS last year $40 per share; this year $40 per share. Can it really be that the company will earn $0 per share in 2023 and 2024? What does your brain tell you about this scenario?,2022-11-18T19:26:22Z

$ZIM  just fire Eli as he doesn‚Äôt know how to run a publicly traded company.  His incompetence has hurt every shareholder,2022-11-18T19:01:07Z
$ZIM the market is not a present-value machine. It&#39;s a forward-looking machine. If you don&#39;t understand why this has dropped since ER is because you missed the huge earnings warning for the fiscal year and the fact that the dividend (again, going forward) is predicated on profitability. So the market doesn&#39;t care about cash in hand -- at all. Only cares about 6-9 months out and this company like every one in the shipping business big or small will likely lose money next year. If they cancel the dividend, this stock could be cut in half. I&#39;m currently net-long on this stock so I have no interest on fear mongering. It&#39;s a warning for the dividend-seeking crowd to do their DD and look past the hefty dividends given in the past.,2022-11-18T18:49:05Z
$ZIM management still running Zim like it‚Äôs a private company.  Eli I hope you read the boards sometimes as you have a share liquidity problem which is destroying your shareholders.  Until you buy back shares this is going to be extremely undervalued because of your decisions.  Another year of this and we‚Äôre coming to have your removed .,2022-11-18T18:48:11Z
