$ZIM if i bought stock between 9/1-9/8 will i be able to get the next dividend ?,2022-09-10T23:28:06Z
$ZIM Shareholder Equity = $5.24 Billion, Market Cap = $3.77 Billion.  Do the math.  If ZIM were to close its doors today shareholders would get back over $1.5 Billion dollars (divided by total outstanding shares) on top of the current share price.  Don&#39;t sell for a loss.  Your just giving money away to shorts.,2022-09-10T18:41:10Z
$ZIM Just remember fundamentals eventually win out. Even with an industry slowdown next year, in this high interest rate (which the FED is saying is going to last a while) environment, cash is huge.  And ZIM is loaded with free cash flow that will help them weather any downturn.  We all know these crazy future projections for all these overvalued growth stocks will get revised soon once the reality of sustained high interest rates kicks in.  Best place to be right now is value, which current ZIM is insanely undervalued.,2022-09-10T18:13:23Z
$ZIM Why does it say Zim pays 27.10 per share per year and yet the latest announced quarterly dividend is 4.75?  Does they divide 27.10 by 4 unequally?  New to dividends and am curious how this works?,2022-09-10T16:51:41Z

$ZIM 

The current annual dividend is $19: four quarterly payments of $4.75. This delivers a 59.26% dividend rate using today&#39;s market close price of $32.06. Any other published rate is old and may include special or extra dividend payments.
