$ZIM is 7 weeks into its Darvas Box breakout and just had a nice EPS report. I messed this one up bc you really needed to have extra-patience and sit with this one 
 
For a company making TONS of $$ buyers seem almost reluctant to buy it. Time cures that #patience,2022-03-12T04:11:43Z

$UNFI not the upward movement I wanted but patience is my friend. $DAC and $ZIM bring my other two sizable position making this week a little easier. All high volatility but seem to yo-yo opposite one another.

$ZIM so playing this both ways do we buy puts on the 21st than?,2022-03-11T23:12:35Z
$PXS thesis is simple. If $ZIM goes higher so too will this. We‚Äôve seen the theme play out. When large cap oilers were vertical they came for small cap oilers. When Gold and mining large caps were vertical they came for the small caps. When ZIM keeps going you‚Äôll be glad you listened,2022-03-11T23:01:45Z
