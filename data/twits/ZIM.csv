$ZIM Ex-dividend date is March 13. And yet, if you read the last 200+ posts, several people think they know exactly what the dividend will be; they say things like $6.40, etc.

$ZIM Sorry to spoil the party, but the Q4 dividend will be based on the actual 2022 annual earnings. Since the results will be announced after another week, there seems no point in speculating about the matter now, unless the intention is to mislead. You wouldn&#39;t want to do that now, would you?,2023-03-04T20:49:01Z
$ZIM  
A lot of discussion going on about estimated forward dividend yield after the upcoming payout on FY ‚Äô22 results. 
 
Let‚Äôs be clear. For there to be ANY dividend payouts or ANY yield in 2023 and 2024, ZIM will need to greatly outperform current estimates.  
 
Consensus estimates on earnings for the following 2 years is negative. Meaning that there will be no dividend (since 30%-50% of nothing is still nothing).  
 
More specifically EPS estimates for 2023 is -1.52 [range -3.06 to +0.92] and 2024 is -4.95 [range -9.65 to -0.26]. These are VERY negative. It is quite a bad sign when the high estimate is still negative.  
 
Cheerleaders and bag-holders can hope and pray all they want, but these are likely to be the results. A dividend yield of above 0.0% for ‚Äò23 &amp; ‚Äò24 is only possible with unexpectedly high over performance. 
 
If you are low on funds, or you cannot afford to lose what you bet, then look elsewhere. The is a real possibility of ZIM remaining below $20 until 2025.,2023-03-04T20:31:36Z

$ZIM @Cristi Interesting take for 2023 and speculation only. Posting this will have no bearing for 4th Quarter 2022 and upcoming Dividend. On 3/13 when earning are provided and Dividend is declared, feel free to provide everyone 2023 guidance.  (NFA),2023-03-04T15:57:21Z
Going forward, I believe it is reasonable to assume actual dividends for $ZIM to be about of about 60-70c/quarter after paying the 25% Israeli tax. So you might be able to get a 11-13% dividend yield for a $22 share? 
 
These decreases are probably what is behind the big drop in share price from the last few months. My reasons for assuming a big drop in profits and dividends are: 
1) return to normal container rates. The 2022 were abnormally large and they seem to be coming down. The company even tell you so in the earning reports (&quot;the increase is driven by increased container rates&quot;) 
2) estimates from the company. They only publish the EBIT, but they seem to pay about a 25% income tax, so it is fairly easy to estimate net income from EBIT. 
 
If you look closely at the Q3 earnings report, you see the EBIT for the whole year and subtract the 9M value. I took the middle of the range 
 
And here are some guesses on container rates: https://www.drewry.co.uk/supply-chain-advisors/supply-chain-expertise/world-container-index-assessed-by-drewry,2023-03-04T14:37:39Z
$ZIM Earnings date is March 13, 2023. Would it be likely that the ex-dividend date will be approximately March 22 to 26, 2023? Please forgive the ignorance of my question.,2023-03-04T14:37:07Z

I have done a little bit of research and came up with some guesses regarding $ZIM  Q4 earnings that will be announced on March 13, 2023. 
 
A lot of people will hate my estimates, but I am not here to make people happy by giving them false hopes. Also, you should keep in mind that when I do my research, I plan for the worst and hope for better. If the numbers work with pessimistic estimates, they will work really well if the company does better than I think. 
 
My estimates for Q4 are as follows: 
Net income: $444M (Q4) vs $1.16Bn (Q3 2022) 
EBIT: $600M (Q4) vs $1.5Bn (Q3 2022) 
EPS: $3.7 (Q4) vs 9.69 (Q3 2022) 
Dividend: $1.11 ($0.83 actual for me after paying 25% Israeli tax? Q4) vs $2.95 (Q3 2022) 
 
I am not very confident about the dividend. It is just a guess, but I am sure it will be a lot less than a lot less than people here hope.,2023-03-04T14:29:35Z
