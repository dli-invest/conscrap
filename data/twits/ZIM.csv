$ZIM For those who don&#39;t understand how ZIM can be trading at this PE, its because the PE was temporary. This chart is the container price from China to LA, USA. I think it sums it up nicely.  
 
ZIM is going from huge profits, to potentially losing money next year.,2022-10-10T05:45:03Z

Yes $ZIM is down almost 50% in the last year but zoom out a bit more and you‚Äôll see it‚Äôs still up over 100% in the last 5 years. As long as earnings are good and the dividends are decent I‚Äôll keep buying and hold long term. #passiveincome,2022-10-10T01:05:37Z

The Altman-Z score of $ZIM is much better than the industry average of 2.00. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/ZIM/fundamental-analysis?key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-10-09T11:21:02Z
$ZIM 

I&#39;m confused why people are hating on ZIM. All the metrics are favorable:
- Low P/E (0.60 compared to industrial average of 1.65]
- High EPS ($30+ industry average, 204% vs prior TTM.)
- PEG lower than 1, (near 0)
- Low P/B ratio so it appears undervalued.

Not to mention, it&#39;s near the bottom of the 52 week range, so a discount.

So what is it you all hate?

The unsustainable dividend?
Unrest in the world?
The relatively small cap compared to others shippers?

To me set it and forget it. Enjoy the dividend while you can (if it does drop) and keep reinvesting. Everything sucks right now. This company looks really good to me, and going long is a good decision, but I may be missing something.,2022-10-09T01:06:56Z

$ZIM Don&#39;t just keep throwing money at stocks, wait for a follow-through day. A follow-through day is Day Four or later of a bear market rally and is defined by a gain of at least 1.25% with a larger trading volume than the previous day. Although a follow-through day signifies a recovering stock market, the market can drop again. However, no bear market in history has turned bullish without a follow-through day.,2022-10-08T07:11:39Z
