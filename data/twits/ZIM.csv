$ZIM: The low PEG Ratio, which compensates the PE for growth, indicates a rather cheap valuation of the company. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/analyzer/stock/ZIM?view=fundamental-analysis&amp;key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-05-26T05:08:00Z
$ZIM So again per the SEC website: Once the company sets the record date, the ex-dividend date is set based on stock exchange rules. The ex-dividend date for stocks is usually set one business day before the record date.  
 
‚ÄùNow this is the most important paragraph‚Äù 
 
If you purchase a stock on its ex-dividend date or after, you will not receive the next dividend payment 
 
Instead, the seller gets the dividend. If you purchase before the ex-dividend date, you get the dividend. 
‚ÄúSo you must own $ZIM by close on the 26th to receive it and that I why the day of record is the 31st and follows the T+2 rule.   Trying to buy it the 27th will be too late to receive the dividend.  This is per the SEC.‚Äù

$ZIM someone fill me in‚Ä¶ so if I own shares in $ZIM on 5/31 and sell after 5/31 will I still get the dividend in June?,2022-05-26T02:41:54Z
$ZIM I&#39;m confused.  First question, I thought EX Div  was 5/27 then  I saw reports recently that it is Thur 5/26 with pay out on 5/7.  Which is  the  correct date. I&#39;ve been swinging  Zim but just restablished a position  before the Bell hoping to make the ex  div.  Next I  see there is concern for T+2, I  trade using  margin mainly to  avoid settlement, I never wait  for trade  settlement  on marginable securities just  sell and  reload.  That  said, I  bought today.. I was  told by my broker I can sell anytime on ex-div date or  beyond and  still be eligible  for the div.   You have  me concerned now not  knowing which  ex-div is correct 5/26  or 5/27  and I should I be  concerned on  t+2, not doubting, just never  heard  that  concern before  as a consideration.,2022-05-26T02:33:20Z
$ZIM you are not the owner of the shares till the stock trade settles which currently is T+2. So Thursday Is the day you have to own purchase the stock by to officially be the holder of record on the 31st.   It‚Äôs on the SEC website.,2022-05-26T01:38:20Z
$ZIM Settlement dates vary, according to the type of security. All stocks are currently T+2; however, bonds, mutual funds, and some money market funds will vary between T+1, T+2, and T+3.3 
 
The SEC has recently introduced a proposal to shorten stock and ETF settlement to T+1. If approved, the new rules would be in place by some time in 2024.
