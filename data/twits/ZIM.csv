Falling from on high 
Despite the downward pressure on rates, Sand says the market needs to keep a broader sense of perspective. He notes: 
 
 ‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt lose sight of how historically strong prices are at present. If we look back to January 2021 rates for both spot and long-term agreements for the trans-Atlantic fronthaul averaged around USD 2 000 per FEU, roughly a third of today‚Äôs prices. That demonstrates just how high this trade has been flying‚Ä¶ but also how much room there is for further falls.‚Äù 
 
Interestingly, Xeneta‚Äôs data also illustrates that this trade is one of very few where spot prices are still above long-term rates. An important distinction for shippers that, on competing trades, may be tendering for long-term contracts at or around today‚Äôs spot rates. 
 
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a strategy to utilise here,‚Äù Sand concludes, ‚Äúas you‚Äôll most likely end up paying over the odds in the long-term.‚Äù,2023-01-23T20:17:50Z

Follow the money 
Sand points out that the North Europe to US East Coast trade continued to deliver exceptional profitability for carriers through to the end of last year. At a time when rates were nosediving elsewhere. 
 
He explains: ‚ÄúIn Q4 the average transit time here was just over 20 days, delivering an average revenue per TEU per day of USD 360 per FEU for carriers. In contrast, the revenue per TEU per day from the Far East to the US West Coast was only USD 160 per FEU. So, if you have available capacity where would you look to deploy it? It‚Äôs a no-brainer: You follow the money.‚Äù,2023-01-23T20:17:05Z

$ZIM someone smart please educate me.   Dividend is supposedly five bucks for end of Feb.  March put option for 17 strike is a dollar.  Why not buy puts for insurance?  After dividend, likely drop to 13 at today&#39;s price.  The put will become in the money at 16.,2023-01-23T20:02:10Z
