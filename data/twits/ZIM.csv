$ZIM Sticking my neck out, I&#39;m going to predict $22.5 for close on Friday, based on today&#39;s options open interest. Max pain is a little higher, at $25 (that could change too). Open interest will seldom be this high, so if I am wrong, my faith in the &quot;pain&quot; will be weakened.,2023-04-19T19:42:10Z

Jonathan Stern, a senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies sees Europe restricting Russian LNG as ineffective. 
 
‚ÄúEU countries deciding whether to restrict Russian LNG imports is political posturing because, unlike pipeline gas, if Europeans refuse to import Russian LNG it will simply go elsewhere, other LNG  from the United States, Africa and Qatar will come to Europe, and the big winners will be the shipping companies,‚Äù Stern told NGI.,2023-04-19T16:46:20Z
$ZIM Have to close the gap from last week.,2023-04-19T16:12:03Z
@Bluest $ZIM will report Q1 2023 earnings on May 17th. At that time, we&#39;ll learn if and when and how much for the Q1 dividend. The ex-div date tends to follow within a couple of weeks of the record date. The payment could then be in late June or early July. For NYSE ADR shares, there can be a lag of up to a week as the payments clear the US banking system to brokers. For FY 2022 ZIM paid $34 per share, which amounts to an almost 80% TTM average. There is no guarantee this will continue. Some analysts are very bearish but the company fundamentals are very strong and the business model is designed to smooth the volatility. That hasn&#39;t worked for share price but I believe the Q1 earnings report will much stronger than some of the analysts predict. Morningstar has the shares at 247% undervalued.,2023-04-19T15:37:38Z

@DarvasBoxGuru @SeeminglyOrdinaryPodcast  
Orrrrrr...  The shorts come out at $24 (after your $24 buy) and knock it back down since it seems the shorts love to short $ZIM.   
 
So instead, you buy some now (well below $24), it doesn&#39;t need to be a &quot;load the boat&quot; buy either...  maybe just a 1/3 of a boat.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è   If it drops (on weak demand), load a little more.  If she goes to $24, wait and see what prevails. If it retains solid support at $24, load a little more and average up. 
 
And too, I know the stock is going to do something in that ER is only a month away and ex-div is only 6-weeks away (assuming they stick to schedule) and $ZIM pretty much always beats consensus as well as their own guidance. Puts 1st Qtr dividend between $0.90 to $1.50 max.,2023-04-19T12:57:43Z
