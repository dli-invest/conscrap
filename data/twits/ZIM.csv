$ZIM Ex-div. Date supposed to be in Monday (August 29) so why we opened yesterday (August 26) with 4.75$ less?,2022-08-27T17:48:48Z
$ZIM you see the problem is, zim should be $400 per share.  
 
Then it would have a normal dividend and a normal PE ratio.  
 
And not all the kerfuffle about dividends.

$ZIM only thing that worries me about ZIM, is the fact they lease their ships which is an expense rather than owning the ships, which is an asset. Expenses change, assets depreciate. Over the long term ships leases can go up like rent,2022-08-27T11:54:07Z
