$ZIM Lower fuel prices increase our profit margins. Nice to be sitting in a stock with over 80% profit margins.,2022-06-13T03:47:37Z
$ZIM extremely low P/E and high dividend in this environment should work well for this stock. In addition shipping is about to go into it‚Äôs busy season as companies get ready for the holiday season and compete for container space as the supply chain disruptions persist.,2022-06-13T03:10:11Z
$ZIM more lock downs in China, so where does that leave container shipping.,2022-06-13T02:38:06Z
@NNdiMethyl you mentioned $ZIM when I was offering up TA requests, and I‚Äôm glad you mentioned it! A lot of major dividend producers took a bath last week, and ZIM seems way overdone! From these prices, the yield on dividends this year is 42%! Big opportunity to grab it imo. And the technicals totally agree:

The dip was eaten up by market makers AND large pockets, as evidenced by the rise in accumulationdistribution and relativevolumestdev during the downtrend ‚úÖ
The TTMScalper called the bottom with that green up arrow around 52 ‚úÖ
The TTMTrend isn‚Äôt blue yet, but it‚Äôs working on it. We want two blue arrows in a row to call it bullish we only have 1 right now ‚è±
The MACD is in a strong bullish spread, under 0 but the slope is nice ‚úÖ
The DPO is nice the MOBO, bullish breakout ‚úÖ
The Williams is over -50, bullish momentum ‚úÖ

Big one, rare to see: bollinger bands squeezed and TTMWave over O, suggesting a bullish expansion incoming ‚úÖ

I LOVE it, will add it to my dividend portfolio $IEP, $LPG,2022-06-13T02:27:59Z
$ZIM Imagine blaming &quot;high shipping costs&quot; for inflation, when the oil industry has yet to reach pre-pandemic full production to ease prices. They&#39;re reveling in this shit. Meanwhile, Biden&#39;s embargo and sanctions on Russia are another huge reason why oil is through the roof. And yet he blames shipping costs? What a joke.,2022-06-13T02:27:25Z
$ZIM I‚Äôm starting to get cold feet. Huddle up and talk. Things feel different. I‚Äôm not talking about ZIM. I love ZIM. But what I‚Äôm saying is that the current status quo is about to burn all of us. Go to cash?,2022-06-13T02:15:34Z

$ZIM Technical downtrend. Next support test is 44 dollars.,2022-06-11T22:35:48Z
$ZIM Great stock but i think their profits wont be anywhere near last quarter China was not shut down last quarter, this quarter China has  been shut down most of the quarter so I believe there profits will tank next earnings date and the stock price will suffer but In my opinion I cant see this going below $44.00 to $45.00 that is  my target to get back in.
