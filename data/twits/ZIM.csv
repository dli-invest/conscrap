$ZIM Will the price drop on 2023? Im looking for a good entering price.,2022-11-27T01:14:23Z
$ZIM It looks like it always drops immediately after dividends (as expected), then keeps dropping for a while.  Before the monster dividend, 1st quarter 2022, it bounced back after a week.  It took a little over a month the other times.  Maybe sell first thing Monday, then buy back Mid-February. Thoughts?,2022-11-26T20:57:31Z
