$ZIM short term setup I‚Äôm watching with Zim on the bullish side.  2 day high of 18.85 is my green light to be aggressive, and of course the 50 day at 19.31.   Remember this market is for trading, not buying and holding divvy traps.  Cheers.,2023-01-29T21:40:14Z
$ZIM I‚Äôll buy at 18.90 just for my munchkins,2023-01-29T20:55:06Z

$ZIM What if Global Shipping rates have stabilized at what is a very profitable level for ZIM?  We already have 1 analyst last week who has revised this years revenues and earnings up.  Has the market price for ZIM been discounted to adjust for shipping rates declining by 6%/month throughout this year?,2023-01-29T18:48:15Z

$ZIM  
ZIM E.R. Date is 8 March. ZIM won&#39;t do much until around 1 March.  
They are expected to easily beat last year and....last quarter. 
THEN, this will go back to nearly $ 100.00 per share.  
These people are &quot;Israelis&quot;.  They are &quot;In It For The Money&quot;. And &quot;Israelis&quot; KNOW how to make money. We have faith in them. :),2023-01-28T19:52:27Z

$ZIM Given today&#39;s action I&#39;m more confident than ever about getting thru $18.80 within the next 5 sessions.  I know that being up 15% seem like a stretch since $16.23 less than a month ago. Once we have firmly secured $18.80, we drift up on low volume to $26.50 which will be up an additional 30% by or before 3/8.  That&#39;s what I think!,2023-01-28T00:31:41Z

$ZIM for you divy peeps. Who is trying to accumulate steady income streams.  Here&#39;s the top 3 divy stocks I like. I&#39;m not some guru so take it or leave it.  $ZIM ,$PBR , and $ARR .
Zim solid company. Steady profits. Around 70percent divys yearly. Avg 3 bucks a share. With special divy for first quarter every year per company mandate.
Pbr is a gas company. Around 11 per share. Paying about 50 percent divy. Ok wned half by the brazil govt. So they want to keep divys coming into their spending budgets.  
Finally arr. It&#39;s a reit.  Stays at around 6 bucks per share. Mainly because it pays divys monthly.  Pretty steady at .10 per share. That&#39;s 20 percent per year. Makes compounding build up fast if reinvesting divys. Instead of quarterly. Each month get more and more to increase growth over the 20 percent. 
If your steady day trading and throwing those profits into these.  You&#39;ll be sitting pretty at end of year.   Ideas from a lowly retail trader.,2023-01-27T21:21:21Z
$ZIM There are a number of factors controlling the share price right now.,2023-01-27T21:02:16Z
$ZIM Old news on media. Don&#39;t be fooled. Go directly to ZIM.com for latest news. ZIM likely to take a hit after hours. No worries. Dividend day will be much higher.,2023-01-27T21:01:29Z

$ZIM the WEF is promising multiple crisis this year.  
 
They have shown their hand. They will print money and ease monetary policy every &quot;crisis&quot; to train investors that a crisis is good for the market and we should want more crisis to make money off of.  
 
Tyrrany is the best thing to happen to the stock market, freedom is bad and you will lose your money.  
 
That&#39;s the new macro economics.   
 
So start sinking ships and start WW3. A sunk container ship or oil tanker would be the most bullish thing that could happen to the market. 
 
It&#39;d probably going to be a container ship full of cars and computers sunk by nato, and blamed on Russia,  since this is a war on the American middle class after all.,2023-01-27T20:48:11Z
$ZIM Market flushing. How far in 10 minutes? I don&#39;t know. Bounce back? hmmm.,2023-01-27T20:46:56Z
$ZIM Be careful. Market way up. ZIM up a little. DOW will crash as usual? Then what? It&#39;s early for a ZIM breakaway yet. I could be wrong.,2023-01-27T20:43:15Z
