LAST WEEK UP THIS WEEK FLAT 
 
The composite index remained relatively stable (decreased a marginal 0.1%) this week, but has dropped by 78% when compared with the same week last year. 
 
The latest Drewry WCI composite index of $2,132 per 40-foot container is now 79% below the peak of $10,377 reached in September 2021. It is 21% lower than the 10-year average of $2,695, indicating a return to more normal prices, but remains 50% higher than average 2019 (pre-pandemic) rates of $1,420. 
 
The average composite index for the year-to-date is $2,134 per 40ft container, which is $561 lower than the 10-year average ($2,695 mentioned above).

Good news from the Frieghtos Baltic Index :,2023-01-12T18:34:41Z
$ZIM Sorry, one last post from me. Last night, just to check my sanity in this Alice-in-Wonderland market, I had another look at ZIM&#39;s financial reports over the years. In particular, I was interested to see whether the changes in book value (taking into account equity lost to dividends) were comparable to declared earnings (should be, if earnings reflect an economic reality free of creative accounting). Yes, all seems well, although the company was in trouble before 2018 (the pre-Glickman era). 
 
What interested me was the way in which the yearly change in book value turned around from a negative value in 2018, -131 ($millions), to -28, +526, +4862 through 2019, 2020, 2021, and has already reached +4167 in 2022 (without Q4 earnings). To put in simple terms, a change in book value of 500M means a dividend of about $2 pa. What will happen in 2023? I have no idea.,2023-01-12T18:25:04Z
$ZIM Things like this baffle me. Disney is in the toilet and planes are grounded thanx to Secretary Pete Buttigieg and so we are supposed to swallow this: The Dow Jones Industrial Average is climbing Thursday afternoon with shares of Walt Disney and Boeing delivering the strongest returns for the price-weighted average. Shares of Walt Disney (DIS) and Boeing (BA) are contributing to the index&#39;s intraday rally, as the Dow was most recently trading 296 points higher (0.9%). Walt Disney&#39;s shares have gained $4.05, or 4.2%, while those of Boeing are up $6.53 (3.1%), combining for a roughly 70-point bump for the Dow. Caterpillar (CAT), Salesforce (CRM), and Honeywell (HON) are also contributing significantly to the gain. A $1 move in any one of the 30 components of the index equates to a 6.59-point swing.,2023-01-12T18:24:46Z
$ZIM shorty keep going!! I love it!! Where‚Äôs your seeking my shares news posts???,2023-01-12T18:22:56Z
$ZIM DOW is fake. CPI was flat. Middleman will not feel relief in 2023. Elites have over blown the DOW. My opinion. It will fall.,2023-01-12T18:17:51Z
$ZIM If you went up to strangers in New York and offered to give them a $50 bill in exchange for $20 I guess most of them would decline the offer. So it is with ZIM at the moment. The pundits on SA try to sow fear by playing on the ignorance of retail investors. Debt. Freight rates. Reneging on dividend policy. War. Oil prices. Finally, the terrified retail investor sells - but who is this willing buyer that seems to have an infinite appetite for shares at $17 (a level that has not been seen since IPO days, well before ZIM became one of Israel&#39;s most profitable companies)?,2023-01-12T18:04:46Z
$ZIM Bought another 1263 shares below 17.1. I can&#39;t help myself. Book value at end of Q3 was $48.5 per share.,2023-01-12T17:05:35Z

$ZIM am I a fuggen idiot or is this undervalued as fuck. The dividend was 12.00 on a 17.00 now share even if this stock halves it‚Äôs insane value unless I‚Äôm retarded of course.
