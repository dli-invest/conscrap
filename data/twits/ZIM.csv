Zim has contracted for a ten year LNG fuel supply with Shell. Ten ships owned by Zim will be duel fueled allowing more flexibility during war and supply chain issues. LNG costs more, but it gives an added nimbleness in corporate logistics. Overall a big competitive advantage. It takes the place of business interruption insurance: self insuring companies should look at this option.,2023-03-10T02:58:31Z

Still some debate about what to expect for the expected dividend announcement on Monday. There shouldn‚Äôt be.  
 
Estimates are easily available so sticking your head in the sand is just irresponsible. You can be disappointed sure, but these are reasonable expectations given the current challenging business of shipping.  
 
The math is very straightforward. An EPS of $2.21 will result in a final dividend -- again, depending on the rate of a potential top-up of between 0%-20% ‚Äî in a pretax dividend of $0.66-$8.14 (including the Q4 2022 at 30% &amp; the full year 20% top-up). See below for the figures.  
 
They would need to more than triple current estimates to achieve EPS of $8.00 in order to have an $11.00 dividend at full 50%.  
 
 Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Total 
30% Q Base Rate: 2.85 | 4.75 | 2.95 | 0.66 | 11.21 
Top-up low 0%: 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 
Top-up high 20%: 1.90 | 3.17 | 1.97 | 0.44 | 7.48 
Final Range: 0.66 - (0.66+7.48) =  [0.66-8.14],2023-03-10T00:43:58Z
@Armani69 @Armani69 $zim
30%-50% of 2022 net income to be distributed as dividend.  

EPS Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + estimated Q4 =
14.19 + 11.07 + 9.66 + 2.2 = 37.12

 40% of 37.12 = 14.85 &lt;-- total divi per share for 2022

Already paid out = 2.85 + 4.75 + 2.95 = 10.55

So expected 4Q divi at % of net income is:

At 30%:  11.14 - 10.55 = 0.59

At 40%:  14.85 - 10.55 = 4.30

At 50%:  18.56 - 10.55 = $8.01.
