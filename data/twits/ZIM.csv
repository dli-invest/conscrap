$ZIM once they start the combo of dividend + buybacks then the stock will go up.  If they only do dividends and no buyback, then it‚Äôs lopsided and the stock goes no where.,2022-12-03T03:11:11Z

$ZIM WTF...it really goes to 19. Not buying anymore until I see it&#39;s turning around,2022-12-02T21:33:04Z
$ZIM A pretty interesting day. Last month I sold off 2000 shares of another stock, for tax loss, and got 1010 ZIM in return. Today I sold off another 2000 shares of the same stock at 11% lower, but got 1185 ZIM. So, 17% more ZIM and 11% more tax write-off. How do I sleep at night? Very well, thanks.,2022-12-02T21:11:10Z

$ZIM something is going on behind the scenes with a he big institutions.  In two months this will make sense.  What it is management and citadel and GS know.  The rest of us are in a need to know basis. Don‚Äôt forget ELi has had over 53 million in stock, dividend and salary so far this year.  It blows my mind how corrupt ELi and management are acting,2022-12-02T20:32:59Z
$ZIM Wow, when are these shorts going to get off the bid!,2022-12-02T20:28:22Z
$ZIM We get our divvy next week.   I already got mine spent on more shares.  I am hoping for $8-10 div next quarter, that would again pay for all the shares I have bought over the last week.   Good times.,2022-12-02T20:27:03Z
$ZIM  in my opinion this company will surprise with higher then expected earnings next year and beyond.  
 
I used to work for suncor energy. Remember when oil went negative? They were locked in long term contracts they were getting $55 a barrel the entire time.  Suncor made a profit even while oil prices were $20 per barrel on the spot market. Zim is also locked in with contracts. They don&#39;t ship much at spot rates guys. They set rates where it&#39;s profitable and tge customer wants dependability not the lowest price on the spot market today.,2022-12-02T20:19:09Z
$ZIM This falling because of deal with Shell, but it&#39;s the best deal going forward given Russian oil price cap.,2022-12-02T20:14:30Z
