$ZIM All the analysts who said ocean rates will go down at the end of 2021 and beginning of 2022 did not know that war is coming in Ukraine and China will go to major lockdown. Both event are massive and will create huge increase in prices globally which had direct correlation to ocean rates which move majority of food in the world. 2022 will be a new breaking records year and I believe same for 2023. Imo buying companies like ZIM is one of the best investments in 2022. Truly believe will see new all time high by end of Q2 results. $SPY $QQQ,2022-05-01T23:46:15Z
$ZIM If you look for safety and great buy these days.. imo it is the shipping industry and ZIM is leading the way.,2022-05-01T23:39:51Z
