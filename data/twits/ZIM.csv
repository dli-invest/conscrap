$ZIM waiting for Monday news!,2023-03-11T22:28:05Z
$ZIM so many bagholders here just desperate to get any dividend(which is almost cetainly going to be under $2.75) in order to jump ship.  
  
No loyalty or confidence. Just pathetic meme-idiots circling a carcass for the last few scraps of a meat when all that is left are sun bleached bones, blood stains, and broken dreams.  
  
So funny to watch.,2023-03-11T21:23:56Z
My alerts for LARGE caps. I have timestamps + buy fills for everything What&#39;s my win rate?

I ONLY buy when Algos are tired of selling. How? I buy when &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; is low.
I don&#39;t make 100s of trades. I only buy when I get a confirmation. Ask me for the receipts. 

Next, I&#39;ll trade $ATVI + $CRWD + $SNOW + $ZIM + $NVAX,2023-03-11T20:26:50Z
$ZIM has a good Piotroski-F score of 7.00.

I sold $20 calls on this about two months ago and was mad when it went up to $24‚Ä¶ Now I‚Äôm wondering if I should take my position back‚Ä¶ If this thing is just going to dump to $12 after $88-$10 dividend‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt see the point.,2023-03-11T20:03:25Z

My hunch-

CEO knows that less dividends will crash the stock and confidence of shareholders.

a)He has 3.2 Bn$ in cash
b) Analyst base line profits of 360 Mn$ in Dec Qtr
c) 38$ EPS out of which ~11$ is already distributed, with 30-50% guidance annual dividend
It ranges 11$-19$ out of which 11$ is already paid.

It requires them to pay  from 0-900 Mn$ in dividend.

I think they will close to naive middle and pay 600 Mn$ to keep a round no of 4 Bn in cash reserves-$5 Per share annual dividend.

However dividend not will sustain the spike , it will be commentary on out look and if nos./outlook are better than street- Special dividend &amp;SP can be higher .

Maersk CEO-11 days back is very positive on outlook

https://finance.yahoo.com/m/be4b9a61-83ea-3c5f-9bb8-faa64ae3d82c/logistic-giant-maersk‚Äôs-ceo.html

If they surprise on better outlook and nos, then coupled with Special dividend and shorts interest, it can increase confidence of investors with stock going much higher .

Fed saving SIVB can be a tailwind as well on Monday morning.,2023-03-11T19:01:55Z
