The Piotroski-F score of $ZIM is 7.00. This indicates good health for $ZIM. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/ZIM/fundamental-analysis?key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2023-01-13T20:28:00Z
$ZIM hahaha. They got 20 mins to cover.. it&#39;ll finish over 17.20.  never short with too little time left.,2023-01-13T20:19:55Z
$ZIM Max pain today is $17 (moderate interest), rising to $20 next week (very high interest). Pressure on price will be upwards next week. But max pain hasn&#39;t proven to be as reliable a guide for this stock as one might expect, so don&#39;t hold your breath.,2023-01-13T20:19:30Z

$ZIM going in with 5k shares.   Happy I got them under 17.   Saved me a couple grand.,2023-01-13T19:44:54Z
$ZIM DOWN HARD could be happening in the power hour as the indices $SPY $QQQ $DIA could push lower as well.  Looking $AAPL for a final move into the close.,2023-01-13T19:29:23Z
$ZIM Seems like a good place to be moving sideways at these levels, picked up some more.  For me again, long term multi-year dividend hold.  After several years, hopefully getting a pretty good payout each quarter.,2023-01-13T19:20:18Z
$ZIM just tacked on some $16.90,2023-01-13T18:40:50Z
$ZIM so bets on the close today.....I say 16.99,2023-01-13T18:07:30Z
The Forward Price/Earnings Ratio of 5.79 indicates a rather cheap valuation of $ZIM. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/ZIM/fundamental-analysis?key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2023-01-13T17:47:00Z
$ZIM Rejected and went back down. $SPY $QQQ $AMD $META on the watchlist for the end of day move.,2023-01-13T17:34:44Z
$ZIM downside is limited with shipping rates bottoming out and lots of shorted shares needing to be covered,2023-01-13T17:28:48Z
$ZIM DOWN on the larger timeframes and looks like it is making lower lows. $SPY $QQQ $AMZN $MSFT taking a breather... after the long run.,2023-01-13T17:21:22Z
