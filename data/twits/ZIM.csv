HC Batman!   Have to revise my calc for 2022.  I kept saying &quot;if ZIM does the same or slightly better than 2021&quot; a $19.50 divvi (annual) less the 25% foreign tax makes for a 19.5% yield (assuming $75 /sh). 
 
Per Qtrly EPS chart:  Q1 - $5.17 plus Q2 - $7.39 plus Q3 - $12.16 plus Q4 - $14.16 = EPS of $38.88 /year at 50% (divvi) = $19.44 /sh.  ZIM is paying $19.50 /sh for 2021...  They also had a special dividend of $2.00 over-and-above the $19.50. 
 
Fast-forward to Q1 2022...  It&#39;s not gonna be anywhere near 2021 Q1 - $5.17, right?  It&#39;s gonna be closer to Q4 of $14.16 (maybe higher), right? 
 
So, assuming a flat $14 per Qtr for 2022 &amp; ZIM paying 50% of EPS like they&#39;re doing for 2021 &amp; is their stated dividend strategy going forward...  The 2022 annual dividend looks to be more like $14 x 4 Qtrs = $56 x 50% or $28 /sh...  less 25% foreign tax puts it at $21 /sh (after tax) or a 28% yield.  Or...  2022 Q1, Q2, Q3 at $2.80 (20% EPS) and Q4 at $19.60 (trued up at 50%).  üí∞üí∞üí∞,2022-03-10T20:43:57Z
