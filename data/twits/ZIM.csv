$ZIM the global food shortage will require more ocean containers to be shipped to many countries. The demand is not going anywhere and with inflation everyone will want to protect themselves. Thus, rates are not going down while everything around is expensive. Ocean rate will go down when other rates will go down which means never!,2022-03-26T02:47:01Z
$ZIM It appear that, providing that they meet their guidance (which they have always been conservative with) that the dividend payouts for next year will be as follows: 
 
Q1 2022:  $2.50 - $3.00 (20% of quarterly net income) 
Q2 2022:  $2.50 - $3.00 (20% of quarterly net income) 
Q3 2022:  $2.50 - $3.00 (20% of quarterly net income) 
Q4 2022:  $2.50 - $14.00 (30% - %50 of annual net income less previous dividends paid) 
 
Their guidance is to generate between $7.1 and $7.5 Billion of EBITDA next year.  At the current price level of $68, the $23 of dividend payments give the stock a yield of 34%.  That is absolutely insane!,2022-03-26T02:20:30Z

$ZIM  
Synthetic Long Option position. 
 
I have noticed that last few days this type of position is on discount.  Buying a long call and selling a put at strike at the money is yielding a net credit.  For example, the 65 strike for Jan 2024 leaps yields a $6 credit!   Any speculators as to why the puts have so much premium as compared to calls?  Why are the makers charging more for puts?  Is this related to the spike in short borrow cost?   
 
It makes me nervous thar MMâ€™s are pricing in a drop even as we trade at super low PEâ€™s.,2022-03-25T22:36:58Z
$ZIM Technological Reasons to be Long on ZIM 
 
$ZIM gets Zero credit for this, but they are the first shipping company that has really embraced artificial intelligence and significant technological investments to improve and enhance customer experience and loyalty. Just go to their website and browse their services. I&#39;m an importer in the US of wholesale goods and we use them for a good portion of our containers. They are BY FAR the easiest, most efficient, and best service to work with for the routes that they have available. 
 
$ZIM is being proactive about embracing the growing &quot;direct from Asia&quot; ecommerce channel as evidenced by their latest Baltimore eXpress (ZXB) offering the industry&#39;s fastest weekly bi-directional direct from Asia transport system. 
 
This company has so much innovative technologies and is literally leveraging technology to reinvent the antiquated and inefficient shipping industry. Yet, it trades at a 1.7 P/E!,2022-03-25T22:10:31Z
Financial Reasons to be Long on $ZIM 
 
HOLY SH!T, the are currently generating $40 of free cash flow per share. In theory, you get a 60% return on your money in one year. The company has no debt and an incredibly generous distribution policy (20% net earnings per quarter, 30% - 50% per year). 
 
The company has no debt! They are literally printing money and have zero leverage on their balance sheet while distributing 50% of their net income to their shareholders. Show me another company that has ever done that. There is not even a historical public comparison. 
 
Light asset approach is genius. $ZIM doesn&#39;t own many of their ships, they lease them. But, their leases are covered by corresponding customer agreements where they have already locked in the spread. This is a genius strategy and allowed $ZIM to leverage and prioritize who&#39;s goods get shipped in this tight market to the customers that have long term agreements.,2022-03-25T22:08:31Z
$ZIM  Geopolitical reasons to be long on $ZIM 
 
16 Liquid Natural Gas tankers with the US promising to backstop Europe&#39;s demand for LNG that they currently get from Russia. There will be high demand for $ZIM tankers and rates will skyrocket. 
 
Russia is destroying Ukraine and the country will need to be rebuilt. Ukraine has vast natural resources, but will need to import machinery and materials at a massive rate. This will increase shipping demand far beyond the 2024 time period that most analysts are predicting peak shipping rates.,2022-03-25T22:07:45Z
