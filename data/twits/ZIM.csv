$ZIM for those worried about the stock price going down.  I think you misunderstand the div.   The company is valued based on vaious factors, cash on hand being one of them.   The reduction is stock value is a reflection of the value of the cash leaving the company.   Cash reserves get rebuilt and the stock value should follow and go up.  The stock doesn&#39;t automatically get reduced in value based on a div distribution and the market determines the value.  if the company has good prospects the stock price may not go down (if often does but not always) but should come back.  Happens with almost every div issuing company.  If you buy dip after a div and then rebuilds itself as the company continues normal operations and cash gets built up and dollar-cost avg down.  Long term (as long as the company is solid) is a good plan.   Warren Buffett 101,2023-04-04T01:23:54Z
$ZIM biggest worry right now is.....if this doesn&#39;t drop in morning and people panic, causing buying and the stock to climb.
I&#39;ll end up over paying for more shares with my dividend payment. I really want to grab more shares at sub $20.,2023-04-04T01:11:03Z

$ZIM ok, so riddle me this. Stock opens tomorrow at $16.65 (trades less the 6.80)&#39; so we lose 6.80 if I have 1000 shares I lose $6800. However, I get money from the dividend back but I&#39;m only getting paid $4.80 backdueto tax they take out, so what&#39;s the point of holding for dividend if it&#39;s a net loss? Or am I not understanding?,2023-04-03T23:02:54Z
$ZIM Opportunities to buy cheap from tomorrow. I don&#39;t know how long it will last. Short sellers will cover it.,2023-04-03T22:33:25Z

$ZIM this is very simple: you have to be &quot;on record&quot; ( with the company &quot; by RECORD DATE .

That&#39;s the only thing which matters.

$ZIM ok so the confusion is that shareholders who held the stock on March 24 received a payout on April 3...and the rest had to have to own before Aril 4th to qualify. 
 
I held 6000 sh from March 24 thru today. I sold 3000 today but bought back 3000 in the AH. did I miss the divy?,2023-04-03T21:16:30Z
$ZIM yay divi. If I sell now AH, I will owe it to whoever bought it correct?,2023-04-03T21:08:51Z
