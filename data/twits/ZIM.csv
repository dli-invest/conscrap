@tctranfo @Stocktwits a suggestion for &#39;noisy&#39; ticker streams; how about a mute button for the stream, which can be overrriden by clicking on the ticker. For example, $ZIM is quite cluttered and &#39;noisy&#39;. when i look at my watchlist stream it is mostly all ZIM, and the majority is just noise. Rather than muting all the morons it would mute the whole stream, so I can get all my other tickers news and commentary.,2022-11-10T19:43:53Z
