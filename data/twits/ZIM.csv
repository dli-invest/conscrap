$ZIM if you think about it both numbers are accurate.  
 
If the price is $15 after the next dividend it had to be worth around $25 before EX day which means it would go up more from here then down to $15 only because of dividend price adjusting.,2023-02-13T22:40:08Z
$ZIM I‚Äôm fine with adding this  morning at 20.56   Thx!!!,2023-02-13T22:14:37Z
$ZIM the panic selling on some nobodies downgrade is hilarious. 

Why would a ton of different funds and companies buy 10‚Äôs of thousands of shares in the last couple of weeks if they thought it was going to 15.00? 

They don‚Äôt. They have the same information available to them that quackadoodle has. She is just driving it down for somebody. 

This stock is going to pay way more than 20% dividends for the year so I‚Äôm not going anywhere. I‚Äôll just keep accumulating.,2023-02-13T21:56:56Z
$ZIM Was that the former flight attendant that downgraded?,2023-02-13T21:30:22Z
$ZIM Go back to November and you can see major support at the $21 level that should hold and move up off after this consolidation is done.,2023-02-13T20:42:10Z

$ZIM gap filling from the jump on 2/2.  There is another gap down at $19 so likely lower short term.,2023-02-13T20:18:55Z
$ZIM I could be wrong but that new price target of 15.00 doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s going to happen. lol. Analysts paid for by Elites maybe?,2023-02-13T20:15:55Z
