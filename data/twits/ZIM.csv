$ZIM am i understanding correctly that Israel withholds income tax on dividends?  
 
So I am canadian and I use a tax free savings account which means my tax rate is 0% on unlimited gains in that account.  
 
So I have no other tax to claim against the Israel tax.  
 
Except I assume Israel also has a lower tax bracket and I would be technically in the Israeli 0% bracket too if I only made a few thousand dollars in their country also.  
 
Very confusing.  I would of sold 100% of the dividend if I knew this.,2022-05-27T00:49:13Z

Trimmed about half my gold and silver holdings yesterday, making room for more useful commodity-type stocks in shipping and oil sectors. Of course bottom line reasoning is simple: looking for better performance.
