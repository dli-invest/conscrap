$ZIM This has gotten It‚Äôs fair share of a beating, I think it will be a bumpy ride, but next week I see a positive trend - imho. NFA. 

Hopefully Tuesday opens red. Call at $35 and let It ride. Easy 10-20%,2022-09-04T23:45:29Z
$ZIM on Friday I added 5,000 additional shares. At $35 I figure we getting another $20 in dividend payments this year. So I‚Äôll be in for $15 a share.,2022-09-04T20:29:39Z
$ZIM   Too Much Fear Priced Into ZIM ...  &quot;Trading for around 4.1x the low end of next year‚Äôs EPS estimates, uncertainty has been priced into shares, and then some. Recession or no recession... negative sentiment [is] overly priced in&quot;...

$ZIM  Lashing out at others is the most reliable indicator of desperation... It&#39;s easier to dump on others, rather than offering facts, analysis, and research to support an actual idea or strategy... Anyone can sit on the sidelines and run their mouth... So in the end, the most laughable person in the room is the empty-minded fool lacking anything real to offer...,2022-09-04T20:03:59Z
$ZIM People here desperately trying to convince others to buy this pig. Almost laughable. No proof of tutions loading up. GL anyway..,2022-09-04T19:06:09Z
$ZIM I purchased a small amount into this because it was the right thing to do. I wanted to get to 1k shares but I will have to settle for 186.,2022-09-04T17:33:42Z
$ZIM  What&#39;s clear right now is that ZIM is suuuuuper cheeeeeap.... For 2023 is still very cheap, and for 2024 it&#39;s slightly undervalued... But a lot can happen between now and 2024 that could very well shift in ZIM&#39;s favor... If it&#39;s not taken private before then...,2022-09-04T17:04:23Z
$ZIM  There is an 85% chance that bottom feeders are going to get crushed like cockroaches here on Monday... : ),2022-09-04T17:03:53Z
$ZIM   After cash, the business is essentially priced at zero, which is why it&#39;s very likely that private equity is positioning here... They generally avoid the shipping sector like the plague... But they&#39;re sooooo starved for yield and deep value,  they&#39;re actively positioning to take over shipping sector operators like ZIM... ZIM has no net debt, excellent long-term cash flow generation potential, it&#39;s trading at cash on-hand, and it&#39;s metrics are showing deeply undervalued forward valuations... Their model is flexible and their structure is streamlined and efficient... ZIM is going to be rebounding here beginning on Monday...,2022-09-04T17:03:00Z

$ZIM Shorts are contributing to 1,800,000 and possibly millions more jews becoming jobless or poor good job shorting the stock üëç,2022-09-04T16:43:01Z
$ZIM With all the cash ZIM has and now trading at an undervalued price, seriously look for them to start a very aggressive share buyback program. It would be negligence of the Board if they ignore this opportunity.,2022-09-04T16:42:13Z
