$ZIM 800,000/sh were sold short today starting at 10:30 when ZIM breached $25. Now there are only 100,000/sh available to borrow at 3% fee.  Short selling is future buying and not much ammo left to push ZIM down.,2022-11-08T22:23:28Z

$ZIM despite all the recent movement, we haven&#39;t broken over a 50 RSI on the session level view since Aug 22. To put that in perspective, $ZIM closed at $51.75 on that day. We are &gt; 50% down since then with no change in annual guidance from the company. Let that sink in. A ton of people have priced in the apocalypse for this stock for it to be sitting in the mid/low 20s. You&#39;ve got 6 sessions to go until some cold reality sets in that this is a well run company worth a multiple of the .5 price to book value that is being put on it...,2022-11-08T18:21:23Z

$ZIM allergic to $25,2022-11-08T16:33:48Z
$ZIM ok. So 6 trading session to go before ER on the 16th. Expect it to find a way back into the 30s after that report and the dividend announcement of $3+ 

Only question is- how close do we get to that on the way to the ER? $27,$28, or $29?

If forward guidance is decent, this can easily head back into the 40s also. The current pricing at ~.55 P/E and book value should give way to something over 1 (maybe 2) for forward looking (which will be lower than this year for sure) and then price to book closer to 1 also.,2022-11-08T16:17:15Z

$EJH Adding big when if price stays depressed around the time $ZIM and $GSL dividends come through. Management has sold around 3 million shares in total, but seems like none of the equity transfer agreements have actually happened according to their 20-F . Seems very sus,2022-11-08T15:59:30Z
