My alerts for LARGE caps. I have timestamps + buy fills for everything What&#39;s my win rate?

I ONLY buy when Algos are tired of selling. How? I buy when &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; is low.

It&#39;s a simple strategy. Learn what &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; by Algos.

I don&#39;t make 100s of trades. I only buy when I get a confirmation. Ask me for the receipts. 

Next, I&#39;ll trade $ATVI + $CRWD + $SNOW + $ZIM + $NVAX,2022-12-22T00:20:13Z

$ZIM if you thinking about shorting look at fintel and the buyers list ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ only place they finding shares at this price is from shorty.. I thank you for your contribution‚Ä¶ you can buyback your shares at $275 or a buyout what ever comes first..,2022-12-21T18:45:14Z
$ZIM eps is $50!!! $50 earnings per share.. the dividend is $12 a year.. even if magically they lose 50% profits and making $25 eps a year dividend is well above margins!!! Unless shorty opening up a shipping company and operating at a loss to under cut $zim you a moron!!! Thank you for the opportunity of a life time!!,2022-12-21T18:30:27Z

$ZIM Global shipping rates have stabilized and in the next 60 days will begin a very long and sustainable uptrend. ZIM is now, at this price, an opportunity of a lifetime. UPSIDE 108.4% Price target $34.16.  All the global shippers are up sharply today because of the stabilizing freight rates.
