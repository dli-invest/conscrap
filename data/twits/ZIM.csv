$ZIM  How much is ZIM worth to a private equity shop right now... At least $60 per share...,2022-09-21T01:16:58Z
$ZIM   ZIM here represents one of the best investing opportunities available to public investors in decades... Yes, that&#39;s right...  There has been outright capitulation in these shares (without regard for fundamentals) over the last several weeks to the point where ZIM has become one of the best take-private candidates in the market right now...,2022-09-21T01:12:17Z
$ZIM  Looks like Goldman Sachs is trying to create an extended buying opportunity for themselves with that ridiculous price target... Good thing their price target forecasts are way off 67% of the time...,2022-09-21T01:11:19Z
$ZIM  The reality in the container shipping world is that spot rates continue to follow a well-forecasted, gradual and predictable glide-path lower, while contract rates  move sideways to higher based on the reality that container ship availability will actually contract moving into 2023 because of unprecedented levels of delayed scrapping that occurred during 2021... I&#39;d say about 2% to 4% of the fleet is over-due for scrapping when factoring ESG factors... While that doesn&#39;t sound like much it only takes a 1% shortage to send rates skyrocketing higher... That&#39;s how sensitive shipping rates are to supply/demand imbalances due mainly to the long lead times for new ship supply... ... The convergence of these factors along with inflation will cause rates to stabilize and form a new base run rate much higher than pre-pandemic levels...  Deeeeeeeeeply undervalued... Very bullish...,2022-09-21T01:09:05Z

$ZIM   A concerted stream of 200K shares of market buy orders sent ZIM off its lows to current levels... That means the shorts are very weak and getting weaker... And sellers are exhausted...
