The best and most recent article regarding some mild uncertainty of the near and mid term direction of ocean container freight rates.   
 
Personally, I see them raising in the short term and remaining elevated through at least 2025 (long term because of the new environmental standards being imposed on shipping companies starting in January 2023) 
 
I&#39;d be very interested, after reading this article, where everyone else thinks rates are going.  It&#39;s clear from this article that the industry can&#39;t even agree on where spot rates are much less where they are headed!

$ZIM I think an analysis we should all conduct is how the dividend position offsets the recent pullback.  I was assigned over 2,000 shares today, at an average basis of $74.  Even if stock price remains where it is won&#39;t I recover this in the form of dividends?,2022-04-09T01:21:54Z
$ZIM There should only be one single explanation to this shitty situation; one of these hedge funds manipulating this stock to lower the price to whoop it up entirely. Then we will see the triple digits!,2022-04-09T00:38:28Z
$ZIM is valued rather cheaply when comparing the Enterprise Value to EBITDA ratio to the industry average of 4.73. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/ZIM/fundamental-analysis?key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-04-09T00:17:05Z

$ZIM   Great buying opp this week.  This sunk from sector sympathy but these guys ship rates are going to remain elevated for quite some time. The news did not apply to ZIM.,2022-04-08T22:53:24Z

$ZIM is the dividend real!?????,2022-04-08T21:42:03Z
$ZIM IMHO ZIM is a good  bet at this price...coming off a huge artificial discount  due  to a  recent  high yield  $19PPS div) and there is also a gap down $67(closed)-$60 open next day, should make things interesting when this heats up and gap starts to  fill and it  will!,2022-04-08T21:39:13Z
$ZIM I agree with @TheAlphaInvestor comments, shipping sector got lumped in with decline in transport. Next earnings will reveal the truth,2022-04-08T20:32:54Z
$ZIM wow down ~35% from its all time high in less than a month...,2022-04-08T20:20:30Z
$ZIM Iâ€™m primarily focused on divs not capital gains. The beauty of Zim is that the yield is so high it takes the place of other div stocks of mostly 6-8%(and some higher) which I would need so much more of for the same return. This enables me to diversify and get on some growth stocks without yield too. And while Zim is my second largest position and is down over 2% today and my third largest in an unrelated industry is down also 2%, my largest position is up 5% for the day and keeps me green, showing the value of some diversity. Zimâ€™s return to former glory will come and while we wait itâ€™s fat cheques along the way.,2022-04-08T19:42:45Z

$ZIM $DAC This explains a ton.  Investors confusing trucking rates collapse with ocean shipping rates collapse.
