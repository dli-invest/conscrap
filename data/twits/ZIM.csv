$ZIM MOST gaps are USUALLY filled over time ( am I correct?) If we look at a 6 month price chart, there are gaps @ around 31, 47,58, and 85.,2022-09-18T00:31:36Z

$ZIM @ these prices the probability is 80% (gut calculation) you will get all your investment back within two years.   Even after  the 25% Israeli tax rate.   Dividends are taxed in US much lower than my cap gains rate so that‚Äôs favorable also.   I have 1925 shares bought last year at these prices and will have all my investment back and then some after the dividends this year and that‚Äôs after Israel‚Äôs 25% take.   Think about it: the cash flow from investing in this company is better than buying a small business or short term stock trading (after taxes).  Shipping is a boring ( a plus) business that will never go away (another plus)  and this one is old and well established (another plus)‚Ä¶. And well run (giant plus).,2022-09-17T17:53:18Z

$ZIM rates are dropping and dropping. Bulls are munching dips,2022-09-17T11:08:37Z
$ZIM  The reality in the container shipping world is that spot rates continue to follow a well-forecasted, gradual and predictable glide-path lower, while contract rates  move sideways to higher based on the reality that container ship availability will actually contract moving into 2023 (despite the hype of looking only at new builds, and ignoring extensively delayed scrapping due to excess demand)... The convergence of these factors along with inflation will cause rates to stabilize and form a new base run rate much higher than pre-pandemic levels...  Deeeeeeeeeply undervalued... Very bullish...

$ZIM  The last hour of trading yesterday was a harbinger for the end of the short narrative here... I would be surprised to see further significant downside even if the sector, or overall market continues lower... It&#39;s just stupidly cheap here...

$ZIM container going back to 2k,2022-09-16T22:46:01Z
$ZIM  so fed ex announces record low deliveries.  
 
I see this as a repeat of the pandemic which drove up container rates. Same effect different cause.  
 
So you have ports in the USA jammed full of containers because the port is full, warehouses full, stores full. Backs up everything right out to sea.  Ships waiting to unload.  
 
Yes, shippers will stop loading more containers and wait for inventory to clear.  But the whole thing will get backed up right to Asia again first.  And asian ports will be jammed waiting for everything else to clear. Same effect, different cause.,2022-09-16T22:34:42Z
