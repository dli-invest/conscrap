$ZIM they should buy back shares instead of dividends next time.,2022-04-12T02:38:05Z
$ZIM It&#39;s a shipping company.  It&#39;s not much else,2022-04-12T00:20:02Z
$ZIM $42 by Friday,2022-04-12T00:16:33Z
$ZIM IMO Putin&#39;s war on Ukraine is not about him wanting the assets in Ukraine, its about controlling the shipping routes on the black sea... How do ships get into the Black Sea? The Black Sea drains into the Mediterranean Sea, via the Aegean Sea and various straits, and is navigable to the Atlantic Ocean. The Bosphorus Strait connects it to the Sea of Marmara, and the Strait of the Dardanelles connects that sea to the Aegean Sea region of the Mediterranean. If he controls the the Black Sea he controls a lot of shipping to the European countries that border the Black Sea, Putin deosn&#39;t care about the assets or businesses in Ukraine, he has already destroyed and devastated most of that!!,2022-04-12T00:08:56Z
$ZIM  Rule No.1 
You never invest to a company with Dividend ratio over 7.
This is 30.,2022-04-12T00:04:01Z
$ZIM At the very least this can be thought of a solid dividend play.  Even if it stays undervalued, assuming they still pay out generous dividends.,2022-04-12T00:00:06Z
$ZIM If you want to know why everything, including ZIM, is tanking, watch this video (about 2 minutes in). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tkhvbg0ZbeI,2022-04-11T23:24:46Z

Shipping rates going down due to China shut downs for last 4 weeks,2022-04-11T23:12:33Z
$ZIM 
Thinking of starting a position here.
What is the actual dividend payout and how often?,2022-04-11T23:04:44Z
$ZIM For the life of me, I don&#39;t understand why this stock isn&#39;t ripping upward.  Financials are great.  CEO confirmed on last quarter&#39;s conference call that Q1 2022 would show as much growth as Q4 did (they were almost done with the quarter), supply chain congestion continued, high contracted rates with customers solid, spot rate holding up nicely, war drive more container demand (no more freight from Asia to Europe through Russia). 
 
I really don&#39;t know why there hasn&#39;t been an absolute capitulation at this point and a rip upwards.  What am I missing?,2022-04-11T23:03:12Z
$ZIM any know what&#39;s going on here?  Just seasonal rotation?  Some larger geopolitical factor?  Just a ton of profit taking post-divi?  This stock&#39;s PE is like 1 and some change.  Their metrics are flawless.  I don&#39;t get why it isn&#39;t trading at least 4x current price.  Any insight?,2022-04-11T22:46:04Z
$ZIM Ok â€¦ Iâ€™m down to a $59 avg.  Time ta fuqâ€™n move the other way.,2022-04-11T22:34:03Z
$ZIM I will tell you guys I have been watching zim for a while whenever it drops I am happy ðŸ˜Š so cheap shares for me,2022-04-11T22:31:00Z
$ZIM Please Elon Musk tweet about ZIM.,2022-04-11T21:19:43Z
$ZIM just need some positive news...even positive new adjacent would suffice.,2022-04-11T20:49:29Z
$ZIM been a week or so since itâ€™s been green. Hopefully tomorrow,2022-04-11T20:48:25Z
$ZIM Declines -4.0%. The 14-Apr-22 Option Straddle is Implying a Â±3.9% Move in the Next 3 days https://tinyurl.com/yea8ddss,2022-04-11T19:32:16Z
$ZIM Still bullish at these levels - this is a solid LT play,2022-04-11T19:32:02Z
$ZIM When do they start buying  back their own shares ?,2022-04-11T19:29:00Z
$ZIM Lowest oversold RSI since October &#39;21,2022-04-11T19:28:03Z
$ZIM Zacks is really pumping this stock. I wonder if its because they are so under valued or if they are holding bags,2022-04-11T19:23:51Z
$ZIM I have never been so far into the red and so chill. Iâ€™m a div investor mostly and I have full confidence that Zim is going to be making money over fist for a while yet. In the meantime the price action allows us to load the boat, pun intended, on the cheap before the mood changes. Somebody here is the last guy to sell before the price jumps up. It wonâ€™t be me, Iâ€™m here for the long haul and happy as a clam.,2022-04-11T19:08:36Z
$ZIM People wants to buy it cheaper so they talking shit !
The fact is that nothing changed in the shipping industry 
China just finished the lockdown and we are going to see the effect next month (higher rates) again.

Strong ER next month due to strong contracts the company already signed for the rest of the year (prices of 8000$ per container)
And this beast on the way to +80$ again!!,2022-04-11T18:41:34Z
