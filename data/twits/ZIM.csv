Analyzing ZIM Twitter and Stocktwits Sentiment Trends

$ZIM So assuming future quarters are at the $2.50 minimum( could very well higher), 70% of my position is not in Zim but in other stock none which pay a current dividend. But because of Zim I nett (after Israeli taxes) 10% div return on my whole portfolio. If not for Zim I would have to buy a considerable amount more of other stocks to get the same return or switch back to my previous 70-30 div stock to non div stock allocation and miss out on potential growth. That‚Äôs the power of Zim, bang for your buck.,2022-04-09T18:06:39Z

it looks like the giant Divvy called a top of sorts in $ZIM. Based on its performance now I&#39;d say investors are forecasting &quot;Less&quot; rather then more. Tells me that the economy is indeed slowing in some way,2022-04-09T15:36:20Z
$ZIM ZIM ended the week solidly below the long trend line on the weekly chart.  Manipulation of course.  Large put buys = someone&#39;s going on a stop loss hunt this upcoming week.,2022-04-09T15:19:51Z
$ZIM I supplement my DD with Scott.  Really excellent explaining business performance and valuations.  $ZIM is way undervalued!  BUY!

$ZIM not really concern about transport down but just concern y ZIM down 3% GNK and SBLK EAGLE are back to their ATH but ZIM still having downward trend. Therefore i wondering if there some news that is only impact on ZIM but no others. Or all others Shipping line that held onto ZIM are dumping their shares together after dividend is paid.,2022-04-09T08:49:58Z

$ZIM  
 
I know the broader transportation market correction has been frustrating for anyone that owns ZIM.  Please keep in mind that you&#39;re holding shares that paid out $21.50 per share in 2021 and will likely payout close to $24 in 2022.  That means you may be getting $2 per month per share on each share. 
 
I know it&#39;s frustrating that they don&#39;t do a share buyback.  But, the price fluctuations caused by the dividend adjustments artificially jacks up the implied volatility every quarter.  So sell covered calls against your shares and try to squeeze an extra $0.50 per share in premium out of your shares.  So, that&#39;s $30 per share per year in options premiums and dividends. 
 
I know it&#39;s frustrating that Israel has a 25% withholding tax on $ZIM dividends, but you&#39;ll be able to use that dollar for dollar foreign tax credit to offset the dividend and options premium income.  So, it won&#39;t cost you a dime. 
 
Hold on to the stock and end eventually up with $120 stock that costs you $0.,2022-04-09T07:15:14Z
$ZIM has a good Piotroski-F score of 7.00. This indicates a good health and profitability. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/analyzer/stock/ZIM?view=fundamental-analysis&amp;key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-04-09T05:39:00Z

The best and most recent article regarding some mild uncertainty of the near and mid term direction of ocean container freight rates.   
 
Personally, I see them raising in the short term and remaining elevated through at least 2025 (long term because of the new environmental standards being imposed on shipping companies starting in January 2023) 
 
I&#39;d be very interested, after reading this article, where everyone else thinks rates are going.  It&#39;s clear from this article that the industry can&#39;t even agree on where spot rates are much less where they are headed!

$ZIM I think an analysis we should all conduct is how the dividend position offsets the recent pullback.  I was assigned over 2,000 shares today, at an average basis of $74.  Even if stock price remains where it is won&#39;t I recover this in the form of dividends?,2022-04-09T01:21:54Z
$ZIM There should only be one single explanation to this shitty situation; one of these hedge funds manipulating this stock to lower the price to whoop it up entirely. Then we will see the triple digits!,2022-04-09T00:38:28Z
$ZIM is valued rather cheaply when comparing the Enterprise Value to EBITDA ratio to the industry average of 4.73. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/ZIM/fundamental-analysis?key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-04-09T00:17:05Z
$ZIM back to 70 next week ?,2022-04-08T23:15:04Z
$ZIM   Great buying opp this week.  This sunk from sector sympathy but these guys ship rates are going to remain elevated for quite some time. The news did not apply to ZIM.,2022-04-08T22:53:24Z
