$ZIM what to expect.  Qtr 2 low. Baltics have recovered a lot and stabilizing. So qtr is looking good. I&#39;ll post it. But can&#39;t predict past that. Depends on how govt and fed handles it from here. Or do they crash more banks and businesses on purpose.,2023-04-26T00:55:12Z

$ZIM I&#39;m new to share trading and unfortunately bought 40 ZIM when they were nearly $24 to get the $6.40 dividend. :( Then the price fell on the ex date to about $17 and I was trapped,  I held my shares because I have read across countless websites ZIM is in good shape, even taking into consideration the falling container shipping prices. Last night I bought  more shares at a much cheaper price because on May 16/17 they are expected to announceme earnings for the quarter and the next dividend. What do you guys think, as a newbie did I do the right thing?  I own 76 shares now, so I really hope I havent bought shares in a sinking ship.,2023-04-25T22:55:13Z
$ZIM whats your thoughts on the afterhours  up 35. cents?,2023-04-25T22:48:38Z
$ZIM took them FRC gains today and bought zim on this dip. Double win 

FYI - if you have any bank stocks cover yourself with some long calls or lighten your positions - it’s far from over. That’s my in depth technical analysis. You’re welcome,2023-04-25T22:27:22Z
$ZIM people stressing way too much 

A good number of people including my son are green on this. More traders than investors here. They continue to smash earnings and pay a nice dividend. Even at .80-$1 a share that’s still a fat dividend,2023-04-25T22:05:28Z
@kirkulr Kirk! I figured I’d wait to message until you checked in. 

All the signs are there, you called it; business layoffs, deliveries slowing down, retail has less $ to spend. I got out of $ZIM pretty quickly but it seems to be holding up for the moment.

I trimmed $TSLY on $TSLA weakness but I’ll add when I think it’s time. 

You sold gold?? That’s crazy, lol. Well if you bought trees that’s a good investment.

Yeildmax etfs came out with $APLY while you’ve been gone and $NVDY is set to launch. I might nibble NVDY because $NVDA is a beast, I have a Nvidia tv box myself 😉,2023-04-25T22:00:59Z
$ZIM Even if the company does only earn $100-$500 million in EBIT, that&#39;s still pretty impressive for a company with the market cap size of ZIM. Then you consider they have $1 billion in cash, net debt is negative.  
 
One of the only issues I have is there use of their excess capital. I don&#39;t understand why they wouldn&#39;t have allocated more to pay off the debt they do have. Sure, a boat load of dividends is nice, but they had a great opportunity to wipe out their debt and they didn&#39;t.  
 
They probably feel the debt is manageable, which it is, but still, no debt is better than manageable debt.,2023-04-25T21:43:48Z
