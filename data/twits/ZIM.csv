$ZIM  A railway workers strike would drive the value of all marine container shippers higher because the back-ups at every bottleneck would only get worse, increasing the need for ships as more and more sit at ports waiting to unload...,2022-09-15T01:33:01Z

$ZIM Hi guys, why companies like ZIM going down so much? What is going on?,2022-09-14T21:29:36Z
$ZIM with the impending railroad strike and west coast dock strike, will shipping rates explode again?,2022-09-14T20:38:22Z
$ZIM why is WallStreetBets not talking about this?,2022-09-14T20:29:30Z
$ZIM Price is 31.5$ but cash is almost 28$ ‚Ä¶ insane. Another 12% drop and you get the business for FREE ! 
Crazy even considering the drop in the TEU,2022-09-14T20:27:53Z
$ZIM looks like gap filled at 31.40. Hopefully some solid retail spending tomorrow and we get the real reversal.,2022-09-14T20:18:42Z

$ZIM On the next dividend my investment is free. I have no crystal ball for the future other than I&#39;ll fucking hold this forever now.,2022-09-14T19:24:20Z
$ZIM ZIM is very likely sandbagging here with regard to the value-add of it&#39;s new tech... They&#39;re playing this card close to their chest in order to deliver some unanticipated positive surprises going forward...,2022-09-14T19:03:46Z
$ZIM  Zombie sellers and desperate shorts trying to get some traction here today... Sideliners or accumulators should be buying any weakness because ZIM is going higher...,2022-09-14T19:03:29Z
$ZIM  The reality in the container shipping world is that spot rates continue to follow a well-forecasted, gradual and predictable glide-path lower, while contract rates  move sideways to higher based on the reality that container ship availability will actually contract moving into 2023 (despite the hype of looking only at new builds, and ignoring extensively delayed scrapping due to excess demand)... The convergence of these factors along with inflation will cause rates to stabilize and form a new base run rate much higher than pre-pandemic levels...  Deeeeeeeeeply undervalued... Very bullish...

$ZIM I will keep buying at this price. This will turn around in next two months. Check out Baltic Dry Index this week. This is the busiest time for shipping.,2022-09-14T18:55:54Z
$ZIM ZIM will rebound no doubt. But, everyone will feel the heat come October as the DEMs and REPUBLICANS battle it out for November. Remember the change does not take effect till December. ZIM and most others will follow the DOW if it tanks. Pumpers will scam you with lies. Be careful. That&#39;s what I think anyway.,2022-09-14T18:51:03Z
