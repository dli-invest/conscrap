$ZIM don&#39;t be blindsighted.

Assume we are back in time at 62
Do u think it always good to construct a negative delta position.

I want to find an answer.
Most investors buy stocks for the dividend income n price appreciation.

This ticker is a unique situation. Large dividend income but share price depreciation.

Anyone has a win win strategy. I want to learn. 

If share price go up or down 1 dollar, the account will reflect that. Options can construct a delta neutral or directional negative bearish position. It seems difficult to have a long position n bet on bearishness trend. Thanks,2022-11-01T05:29:03Z
$ZIM you tell me, does it worth the investment to get the dividend twice, but you see the share price cut from 62 to 26

Unless you have some protection, like a collar . How about sell deep ITM call at 62 and buy put. Please let me know

After a stock goes ex-dividend, the share price typically drops by the amount of the dividend paid to reflect the fact that new shareholders are not entitled to that payment,2022-11-01T05:22:44Z
$ZIM Another attempt to value ZIM, assuming various cash flow scenarios. Looking at the worst, it seems a bit optimistic for the next year or two, but perhaps too pessimistic thereafter. The valuations fall in the range $46 to $119.

For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 3.32, which means ZIM Integrated Shipping Services is trading at a large discount to the group.,2022-11-01T03:28:42Z
$ZIM Fantastic results for ONE (Ocean Network Express) in July-Sept. quarter ($5B earnings, same as prior quarter) suggests big trouble for ZIM shorts.

But ONE is forecasting an earnings drop of 61% for the next two quarters. That kind of drop would take ZIM down to about $4 EPS per quarter, total annual dividend next year $8, this year around $20.,2022-11-01T02:28:50Z

$ZIM ZIM sellers will be on strike thru Ex-div date.  Volume drying up on a small float makes things difficult if your trying to accumulate.  If ZIM gets hit hard in the morning, I will be the high bid by a penny until I&#39;m doubled up.,2022-10-31T21:33:29Z

$ZIM Nice pump this morning. But looking wobbly on the 15 minute chart. If we stay above the EMA 4  it is bullish, but below we will test $22.91 the middle Bollinger Band.  
 
I am still expecting a pull back.,2022-10-31T13:58:33Z
$ZIM What happened to the tech and chips corps. driving the market? Ya, what a scam. Don&#39;t trust the analysts. Can ZIM hold above .23 with a down trending market? See that and you know the dividend pressure is taking hold. Still a couple of weeks out.,2022-10-31T13:53:40Z
$ZIM I don&#39;t know exactly when the share price will begin to soar but I can see volume moving quickly. I also see price fluctuation of 4 cents in one hit. Dividend pressure beginning to build. Maybe.,2022-10-31T13:41:24Z
