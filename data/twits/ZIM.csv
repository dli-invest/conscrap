$ZIM have a great weekend, some natural pull-back given market conditions and the run from 48 to 58, long and strong, fully invested here with ZIM (as you can see from my posts) and I also mentioned a week ago to not only buy ZIM, to buy RECONAFRICA (RECAF/ RECO.VN) IT WAS ALL GREEN this WEEK.

$ZIM The ironic thing is that these companies reporting reduced profits (AMZN, AAPL, etc.) are bringing down the market. Take a wild guess why their profit is reduced and where it&#39;s going.,2022-04-29T19:39:34Z
$ZIM snagged 100 more shares today. This is a no brainer. Earnings will be great, rates should remain high, and the dividends will be magical.  
 
This might turn into a great short after Q4 dividend date is past, but until then bullish as hell.,2022-04-29T19:30:56Z

Subsequently, we think average annual freight rates are likely to decrease by around 44 percent in 2023. As this follows two years of very high increases, the dollar values will still be MUCH HIGHER higher than they were pre-pandemic.,2022-04-29T19:12:10Z

When will the freight rate go back to normal in 2023?  
 
SH: Unfortunately, that is impossible to answer as it is linked to the timing of the liner supply chain recovery that is highly unpredictable. The quicker it happens, the sooner rates will recede.  
 
Our working position is that port congestion will be fixed around the midpoint of next year. Subsequently, we think average annual freight rates are likely to decrease by around 44 percent in 2023. As this follows two years of very high increases, the dollar values will still be much higher than they were pre-pandemic.

‚ÄúUnder these circumstances it is highly likely that the economic environment will continue to change dynamically in FY2022, it is therefore extremely difficult to announce a reasonable business forecast for the coming financial year and as such ONE‚Äôs forecasts for FY2022 are yet to be finalised,‚Äù the shipping line said.,2022-04-29T18:01:00Z

Ocean carriers can expect container system inefficiencies to continue through the first half of 2023 as more medium-sized and even lower-volume ports become congested, according to Simon Heaney, senior manager at maritime consultancy Drewry. 
 
Heaney, during a Drewry webinar Tuesday, cited the worrisome trickle-down effects of widespread port congestion, echoing points made by the consultancy in its first-quarter report published at the end of March. 
 
Throughout last year, ports saw unrelenting heavy congestion, and the lack of improvement could mean at least another 12 months of lengthy delays and high freight rates, Drewry‚Äôs first-quarter report said. It identified the Russia-Ukraine war and mainland China‚Äôs zero-COVID strategy as double threats to the global economy that could worsen existing supply chain bottlenecks. Other potential hindrances include regulatory scrutiny, rising bunker fuel costs, decarbonization, and inflation.

According to analytics company Xeneta, shipping costs have rocketed by 11.1 per cent globally to stand 109.9 per cent up year-on-year. 
 
Supply chain demand, successful carrier strategies, and continued COVID-19 disruption in China has impacted shippers worldwide. 
 
Newly released data by Xeneta Shipping Index (XSI) Public Indices has shown near universal long-term hikes across key trading corridors.

It&#39;s a comin.... 
 
Xeneta said contract rates on the Asia-Europe route had increased by 25% since the beginning of the year. CEO Patrik Berglund said: ‚ÄúYet again we see the carrier community sitting pretty when it comes to long-term contract rate negotiation. 
 
‚ÄúThey are, quite frankly, reaping huge rewards from a red-hot market. It‚Äôs a position of power the carriers have no desire to relinquish.‚Äù 
 
Another factor in the recent rush to procure contracts with carriers, as suggested by some of The Loadstar‚Äôs forwarding community contacts, is the rush of cargo that will follow the eventual easing of the strict lockdowns in China. 
 
‚ÄúWe saw what happened two years ago after the lockdowns in China ended and demand surged, we couldn‚Äôt buy a slot at any price for weeks,‚Äù said the UK-based contact.
