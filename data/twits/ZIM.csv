$ZIM futures green (for now) and this thing massively oversold. Hoping for a well deserved bounce tomorrow (but never holding my breath with Biden and his crew of lefty morons running things).,2022-06-14T05:13:15Z
$ZIM Market cap currently $5.7 Billion, Shareholder Equity $4.2 Billion, Free Cash Flow $1.5 Billion.  This is a cash cow that is making money hand over fist.  This dip is simply an opportunity to buy low.,2022-06-14T04:39:49Z

Ended the day holding nothing short, but a few ill-advised longs in $FB, $GOOG and $ZIM. Praying for a relief rally tomorrow, unload the longs and reload the shorts. What do you think?,2022-06-14T00:08:21Z

$ZIM 
House cleaning going on. Profits taken by old farts with no time to wait. I bought 1000 more today. If you got capital to spare take a shot at $CCL. Just about at Covid lows. A bargain,2022-06-13T23:08:28Z
$ZIM ZIM is offering a 20%+ yield, zero leverage, and a strong management team. That makes the stock a hard-to-lose proposition.

$ZIM Fed government china oil price... All the bearish sentiment has no bearing on this stock. What you guys should be looking at is the massive flood of containerships coming online and lack of stimulus. Containerships were a bubble just like everything else covid related.,2022-06-13T20:04:51Z
$ZIM it&#39;s funny people here talking about inflation fears and oil prices rising when we have both for some months already and this was trading over 65 literally 4 days ago. It&#39;s all about narrative, which always follow the price  and not the other way around. Obviously macro situation and the whole market doesn&#39;t help, but it&#39;s not like the macro picture had worsened terribly last week. PE 1 and insane amount of cash. OK. Not enjoying but these prices are a buy objectively.,2022-06-13T19:43:34Z

$ZIM amazing. Down almost 30% in last few days on no company specific news, following dividend and upbeat ER. Ok, with an average of 65, guess I gotta just lube up and take it until market stops being totally irrational with this stock.,2022-06-13T18:58:24Z
