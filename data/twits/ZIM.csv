$ZIM seems like a lot of people on here don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about in regards to the dividend. And that goes both ways(like your mom). Guess we&#39;ll all find out for sure in 2 weeks,2023-03-22T05:37:58Z

$ZIM ZIM&#39;s dividend dates have me confused.  Usually ZIM has an ex-div, record date and payable date in that order.  In this instance ZIM lists Payable April 3; for shareholders of record March 24; ex-div April 4.  I&#39;m looking to avoid the dividend and the hefty Israeli tax, when do I need to get out to miss eligibility,  March23rd??,2023-03-22T02:20:08Z

$ZIM I typed this into ChatGPA: &quot;Suppose I am shorting a stock that costs $23.56. I am shorting 100 shares. Soon, the price of the stock goes to $24, and then $27, and then $30, and then $35. Please characterize what my expenses will be.&quot; 
 
A. When shorting a stock, your goal is to sell the stock at a high price and buy it back at a lower price to make a profit. However, when the stock price goes up, you will experience losses. 
 
In this scenario, you shorted 100 shares of the stock at $23.56, so you received $2,356. As the stock price rose to $24, $27, $30, and $35, your losses increased because you have to buy back the shares at a higher price than you sold them for. 
 
At $24, the loss per share is $0.44 ($24 - $23.56), so the total loss is $44 ($0.44 x 100 shares). At $27, the loss per share is $3.44 ($27 - $23.56), so the total loss is $344 ($3.44 x 100 shares). At $30, the loss per share is $6.44 ($30 - $23.56), so the total loss is...,2023-03-21T18:37:43Z

$ZIM I am not a shorter, so please forgive my ignorant question. It appears we don&#39;t have a short squeeze, yet, although the stock is up $1.16, now. 
 
Q. Suppose the shorts just keep paying interest. Suppose they pay the whole dividend on April 4. And suppose they pay more interest from April 5 to April 30.  
 
What happens to the stock price during all of that time? Do they continue to press downward on the price?  
 
Or does the expense become so high that no shorter in his or her right mind would do this?,2023-03-21T17:16:55Z
