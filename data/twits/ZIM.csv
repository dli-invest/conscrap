$ZIM lol all of a sudden sudden sentiment for Zim is green,2022-03-20T03:44:04Z
$ZIM I see everyone promoting this strategy of selling shares before ex-div date and then buying them back for less on or after ex-div date to &quot;avoid receiving the dividend&quot;.  Why wouldn&#39;t all investors hate dividends then?  If dividends are so bad, why do companies pay them?  Why don&#39;t all investors use this strategy to avoid all dividends? 
 
If I am not mistaken, $ZIM largest shareholders - $KEN and $DAC are in the same boat we are but with a lot more shares.  How pissed are they that $ZIM declared this large dividend?  Their dividends are subject to Israel dividend taxes too.  They don&#39;t get the foreign tax credit refund.  The dividends are also taxable income to these companies.  Their shares in ZIM will experience the same price fluctuations as ours post ex-div date?  Shouldn&#39;t they be absolutely pissed off at ZIM?!?!? 
 
Instead, $KEN and $DAC seem to be thrilled with $ZIM&#39;s dividends and enthusiastic about receiving them.  So, why do so many investors seem to be avoiding them?,2022-03-20T02:00:49Z

$ZIM  
ZIM recently declared a dividend of $17 per share, effective March 22nd, and payable to shareholders of record on April 4th.  The company‚Äôs annual dividend yield is currently 11.5%, much higher than the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs 1.35% yield, with a dividend payout ratio of roughly 26%. There have been two dividend increases in the last five years. https://www.zacks.com/commentary/1884176/like-dividends-these-3-stocks-have-yields-greater-than-10,2022-03-19T08:55:20Z

$ZIM what are some other good divi plays this year?,2022-03-19T02:49:38Z
$ZIM looking forward to collecting a 17 $ dividend. And also looking forward to the company up loading the next 3 quarters divis to maybe 3. Or 3.50 per quarter. And also looking forward to a plus 20$ next April. I like ZACKS price target of 120$. I think that is about 50$ low but what ever.,2022-03-19T02:17:40Z
