$ZIM sounds great but with the market manipulation and theft of Democrats watch and see if you don&#39;t have to take a loss by the div date and you have to pay taxes on the divy while you&#39;re still under water.,2023-03-14T03:01:34Z

$ZIM DUE BILL rules &gt;25% dividend. EX Dividend after Pay Date. Be aware. 
 
2022 Dividends 
In accordance with the Company&#39;s dividend policy, ZIM&#39;s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of approximately $769 million, or $6.40 per ordinary share. Together with prior dividend distributions made on account of 2022, dividend distributions for the year totaled approximately 44% of the year&#39;s net income. The dividend will be paid on April 3, 2023, to holders of ZIM ordinary shares as of March 24, 2023. Since the foregoing declared dividend amount per share constitutes more than 25% of the Company&#39;s ordinary share price on the declaration date (March 13, 2023), per the instructions of the NYSE, the ex-dividend date with respect to this dividend distribution will be April 4, 2023. Shareholders who wish to receive the dividend must hold their ZIM shares until the ex-dividend date.,2023-03-14T01:49:22Z

$FRC *Starting today, the United States enters Daylight Saving Time. My class sharing time will also be 40 minutes earlier. 8:00am-8:30am EST, my class will start.*

$ZIM is not the best time to buy today. Because according to the historical trend, before the dividend is paid, ZIM will generally start to fall back. After all, the dividend per share is as high as $6.

The best time to buy is to wait for ZIM to fall. not now.
