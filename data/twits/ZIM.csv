$ZIM best long term stock period!ðŸ¥°,2022-11-03T22:22:34Z
$ZIM Personally, I see this stock valued in the $30-40 region after they announce the HUGE dividend payments in the upcoming PR that will also show our income way above the general shipping sector expectations due to their superior fleet and rates that blow the competition out of the water. Buy this NOW and youâ€™ll not only see a 50%+ upside on your investment but also dividends so generous you would not believe. The CEO is paid 75% of his income in shares so he HAS to pay out big in dividends to pay HIMSELF. Itâ€™s a no brainer, you wanna get rich like a CEO? Then buy some shares!,2022-11-03T21:40:38Z

$ZIM not gonna sugar coat it.  it was a yucky close.,2022-11-03T20:07:06Z
$ZIM Every day the same two questions - when will the dividend be paid; how much will it be? I worry about the financial futures of the people who invest their hard earned savings without knowing how to find the answers to such questions. No wonder the shorts and MMs are having so much fun with the stock, at our expense.,2022-11-03T20:06:22Z
