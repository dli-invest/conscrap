$ZIM I am back to interpreting the drop in price from early June to early July as hedge funds creating liquidity to get shares.  They did this by aggressively shorting (as high as ~14%, possibly higher as I didn&#39;t check daily).  Since then, the share price has had a controlled ascent with aggressive down mornings to keep momentum from igniting as they attempt to close out their short positions.  If the share price rises too far too fast before they are out of their short positions (still at ~11%), they will likely try to manufacture some more aggressive down days, though it will be difficult with all the higher earnings revisions and guidances.  

TLDR: buy on any dips (or just buy at regular intervals to dollar cost average) because if the big drop was to create liquidity to get shares, you can bet they will be running the share price toward testing ir surpassing all time highs!,2022-07-31T05:00:35Z

$ZIM Hedgies are trying their darndest to create panic amongst zim investors by dropping the stock with momentum (yesterday and this morning) hoping to deter investors.  But it ain&#39;t working obviously.  Question is when do they give up?  Do they think people who are investing in zim are unawares of how the ocean freight companies are doing?  They are going to have to let the shares run and cover while doing so.  Next week should be a blast...off!,2022-07-29T23:39:02Z

LONDON ‚Äì Ocean container rates fell a modest 0.9% this week to $6,761 per 40-foot container. 
 
According to the World Container Index tracking indicator from shipping analytics watchdog Drewry, this marks the 22nd consecutive weekly decrease. Rates are down 28% from the same week in 2021. 
 
Drewry says the index is now down 35% from the peak of $10,377 reached in September 2021. 
 
Year-do-date, the average price for a 40-foot container is $8,219, still 89% higher than the five-year average of $3,574. Rates from Shanghai to Los Angeles fell 1% to $7,199. Shanghai to New York saw no change over last week.,2022-07-29T23:07:32Z

THERE has been a huge jump in the cost of long-term ocean freight rates into Australasia over the past year, according to recent data from benchmarking platform and market intelligence company Xeneta. 
 
According to the company‚Äôs chief analyst Peter Sand, increases since July 2019 threaten to ‚Äúrewrite industry record books‚Äù. 
 
Mr Sand said the global market for container shipping is in overdrive, much to the pain of shippers and adding to the huge profits of our leading carriers. 
 
‚ÄúNowhere is this more obvious that with the chief trades ‚Äì from China, South East Asia and Northern Europe ‚Äì into Australia and New Zealand,‚Äù he said.

Over 8 million shares sold short in ZIM.  Using a conservative $2.5 quarterly dividend next month, shorts will be paying $20 Million.   
 
The company should be making $40/share (conservatively, probably much higher) in income in 2022, and they will pay out 50% of income in dividends-$20/share.  That means shorts will be paying at least $160 MILLION in 2022!! 
 
How about a nice short squeeze before ex-dividend day next month??,2022-07-29T15:36:06Z
