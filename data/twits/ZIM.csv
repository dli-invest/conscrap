$ZIM Due to cyclical nature of shipping Zim earnings are projected to drop over 90% to around $2/share.
There is also a risk of Zim reporting negative earnings in 2024

Yes Zim has tons of cash but if the company does not generate any new in 2023-2024 all it can do is give few enormous dividends and become a penny stock 

Why not wait and buy Zim for around $1 in a little over a year and wait patiently for an upcycle.

If you look carefully you’ll notice that the recommendation of analysts is always ”Buy” regardles of sharply declining stock price and price target is always sharp increase regardles of declining stock price.,2022-12-25T04:50:37Z
$ZIM i am thinking to invest 70k in this stock. do you think reach the bottom? i did little digging and is valued around $25 a share,2022-12-24T23:15:41Z
$ZIM Friday trading was the lowest volume day in 4 months and Sellers will remain absent until at least March 8th.  Global Shipping rates finally stopped the precipitous decline and flattened out last week.  Some of ZIM&#39;s more popular routes were actually up.  An uptick in Shipping rates over the next few weeks coupled with the Sellers&#39; Strike would/will be very nice!  In the meantime the battle of $17.50 rages on.,2022-12-24T19:04:41Z
