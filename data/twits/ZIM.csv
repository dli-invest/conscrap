$ZIM Drop my order on M1 to buy more shares for tomorrow.   $$$ Up or down Im positioned to ROI in less than 2 years.,2022-09-16T04:13:04Z
Over the past 6 months, insider ownership changed 0.00% leaving total ownership at 33.98% for $ZIM. Do you think the employees believe in the company&#39;s future?,2022-09-16T02:14:33Z

$ZIM September is going to be rough throughout. We probably won&#39;t see the market make a comeback until the Oct. CPI readout.,2022-09-16T01:00:34Z
$FDX $UPS $ZIM $XPO 

Fedex  did revenues of 24 Bn+ which is in line with their other quarters

Core issues is their cost management and Under leverage of Truck route capacity 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a sector wide issue but more of a FedEx and truckers issue given cost impact from labor, fuel and under leverage of truck capacities,2022-09-16T00:04:50Z
$ZIM damn,2022-09-15T23:39:47Z
$RBLX $CLF $ZIM Can you believe a garbage company with 2022 revenue of 220 million dollars has a market cap of 26 billion? Can we ship steel to this alternate universe?,2022-09-15T23:10:47Z
$ZIM am I wrong in thinking Fedex news is not positive for ZIM,2022-09-15T22:54:52Z
$ZIM like a lamb to the slaughter , yet they thought they are buying dips,2022-09-15T22:03:18Z
$ZIM Oct calls are cheap as a MF right now,2022-09-15T21:51:35Z
$ZIM  
 
Ridiculous oversold technical readings. 
 
26 on the RSI 
19 on the MFI 
 
Course, it can always get MORE oversold. Remember Peter Lynch: 
 
NEVER THINK A STOCK CANNOT GO LOWER, CAUSE IT CAN.,2022-09-15T21:33:19Z
$ZIM Loading up!,2022-09-15T21:11:50Z
$ZIM Market Cap $3.85 Billion, Shareholder Equity = $5.24 Billion, Free Cash Flow = $1.5 Billion.  2023 Forward P/E = 2.53.  Not to mentioned massive dividend.  Most undervalued stock out there.  Cash &amp; Value is going to be huge with the now guaranteed higher interest rates.,2022-09-15T21:11:30Z
$ZIM thinking about using my dividend to buy more shares.  
 
This stock is just incredible.  
 
It can&#39;t do that again very many more times at some point we will be doubling our money every quarter.  
 
By the way when warehouses are full and inventory is jammed what do you think happens to all the containers on ships? It gets all backed up. Again.,2022-09-15T21:08:19Z
$ZIM Just for You‚Ä¶ 
Even if your average will be $50, even if they will start to pay $2.50 per quarter (not like now $4, $17, $10 crazy), You still will get 20%!!!  per year in Dividends. 
 
I see how people just don&#39;t trust what they see here, and prefer NFLX, AMC, ARK, etc...,2022-09-15T21:04:20Z
$GNK vs. $ZIM: what is the best stock to add to your portfolio?

$ZIM 30 USD key support level,2022-09-15T20:13:24Z
$ZIM crazy if they announce $26 dividends for q4 that would mean this could go as low as $4 if the price is still around the same by that time.,2022-09-15T19:56:08Z
$ZIM Patient watching how low they will get the value of this company.,2022-09-15T19:31:14Z
$ZIM bizarre --December divy likely $4, April 2023 will be around $10 or more, June let&#39;s say $3 and September $3 ---so $20 for holding 12 months on a $30 stock - priceless. idk, not selling my load of shares...my cost is already down to $30 from divys and going to be free in 2023-2024 by holding 12-18 more months.,2022-09-15T19:09:30Z
$ZIM Is there any other stock as volatile as this one?,2022-09-15T19:00:00Z
$ZIM hope that was the double bottom,2022-09-15T18:37:54Z
$ZIM or comparable size company to us is Peleton.  Both have 3.7 billion market cap..  last years income for peleton was a loss of 1.7 billion on 3.5 billion revenue.  Seems very comparable.  Or AMC with a market cap of 10 billion and lost 5 dollars a share and has revenue of 3. 5 billion.,2022-09-15T18:36:32Z
$ZIM 0.60 PE ratio, 87.5% dividend yield. Is this too good to be true?,2022-09-15T18:29:38Z
$ZIM We already hit resistance the impatient will sell the buyers will hold until we get a gain of 5-20$ per share.,2022-09-15T18:26:01Z
$ZIM thing I don‚Äôt understand is that with next to no investment by the market into shipping why investors think that shipping costs are going to go down substantially?  It was like oil and gas Over the last 8 years, nothing was invested and now we have an energy crisis.  Well American investors rather buy ARKK, shopify peleton at 50 PE and terrible balance sheets still,2022-09-15T18:20:12Z
$ZIM we already know they are predicting about $17 - $19 in more dividends THIS year. So buy today and have a cost avg of $12 a share to start next year ‚Ä¶. Easy money,2022-09-15T18:19:05Z
$ZIM Still watching, adding on any weakness like today.,2022-09-15T18:17:54Z
$ZIM big if but We didn‚Äôt break 30.15 so maybe if we get above 34.10 we make a higher low and higher high which is always the first step to a significant bottom,2022-09-15T18:01:23Z
