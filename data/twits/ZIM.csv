$ZIM https://www.investopedia.com here‚Ä¶ since I made the softies cry for not educating. Today we have another round of, idk what I‚Äôm talking about but I‚Äôm talking anyways‚Ä¶ this is a website you can go to and read up on the things you do not understand. Several have asked innocent questions to the board this morning just to have multiple people tell them the wrong answers. This is why I say stop posing questions here. This is not an educational site. 

If you sell ex div day- you DO get the dividend.,2022-11-27T15:20:10Z
$ZIM No one will get the dividend unless you hold your shares till the end of the day of Nov 29th. It will be paid out 12/7. This has what they stated over and over.,2022-11-27T13:21:06Z

$ZIM anyone guess what will be share price at open?,2022-11-27T01:21:12Z
$ZIM Will the price drop on 2023? Im looking for a good entering price.,2022-11-27T01:14:23Z
$ZIM It looks like it always drops immediately after dividends (as expected), then keeps dropping for a while.  Before the monster dividend, 1st quarter 2022, it bounced back after a week.  It took a little over a month the other times.  Maybe sell first thing Monday, then buy back Mid-February. Thoughts?,2022-11-26T20:57:31Z

$ZIM If you don&#39;t buy a Company when it&#39;s down, when would you?  Sometime in the next few trading sessions I&#39;ll be selling the Jan $20 Puts and the Aril $30 Calls.  Any thoughts on that?,2022-11-26T19:42:09Z
$ZIM it‚Äôs funny how the bears appear on this board every day with different accounts üòÇ‚Ä¶..desperate to talk this company down.  
I could understand that course of action if the sp was above $40 heading into a recession but look at the bargain on offer.,2022-11-26T19:27:18Z
$ZIM  A dividend emperor is born.This will be an investment for several years, you just have to collect it, it will always have a place in my strong dividend portfolio.   $$$,2022-11-26T18:24:19Z
