$ZIM  After cash, the business is essentially priced at zero, which is why it&#39;s very likely that private equity is positioning here... They generally avoid the shipping sector like the plague... But they&#39;re sooooo starved for yield and deep value,  they&#39;re actively positioning to take over shipping sector operators like ZIM... ZIM has no net debt, excellent long-term cash flow generation potential, it&#39;s trading at cash on-hand, and it&#39;s metrics are showing deeply undervalued forward valuations... Their model is flexible and their structure is streamlined and efficient... ZIM is going to be rebounding here beginning on Monday...,2022-09-03T19:44:19Z
$ZIM  What&#39;s clear right now is that ZIM is suuuuuper cheeeeeap.... For 2023 is still very cheap, and for 2024 it&#39;s slightly undervalued... But a lot can happen between now and 2024 that could very well shift in ZIM&#39;s favor... If it&#39;s not taken private before then...,2022-09-03T19:43:17Z

$ZIM 

The Loadstar has seen firm rates offered this week on sailings from China, valid through to November, now below $6,000 per 40ft, with unlimited space availability. A year ago, rates from China to North Europe were around $14,000 for Antwerp and Rotterdam and $16,000 for the UK, with cargo being rolled from week to week.

However, back in September 2020, you could ship a 40ft from Shanghai to Rotterdam for about $2,000.

Carriers will be desperate to ensure rates do not fall to these levels again, and will endeavour to slow, if not halt

I mean, what the hell???

The shipping industry expects container prices at major Indian ports to rise another 15-20 percent in the next few weeks, due to global disruptions in shipping routes and high demand from European countries and the US.

&quot;India is witnessing a nearly 200 percent rise in oneway pickup in August from July because of shipments for Christmas,&quot; ContainerX, an operating platform for container logistic companies, said in its latest report.

 Makes you wonder what is happening to the stock price here doesn&#39;t it????

Long-term ocean freight rates climbed yet again in August, edging up 4.1% month-on-month to stand 121.2% higher than this time last year. The latest global data, crowd-sourced by Oslo-based Xeneta for its Xeneta Shipping Index (XSI¬Æ), demonstrates that, despite softening spot rates, uneven demand and ongoing supply chain issues, the world‚Äôs leading carriers remain on course for another bumper year of profits.

$ZIM  The delusional shorts are really stretching reality here... Everyone on earth has known for at least the last 6 months that shipping rates had to fall from thier recent all-time sky-high levels... The reality with all shippers is that divs will decline with rates... But their descent will be a realtively predictable glide-path... So anyone asserting otherwise is just pumping short hype...,2022-09-03T15:50:31Z
$ZIM Based in haifa Israel üáÆüá± is close to where Jesus grew up so in essence your fucking up Jesus hometown indirectly when shorting this stock and you call yourself Cristians?,2022-09-03T15:09:39Z
$ZIM Conservatively, what is estimate of annual dividends (total $/share) for 2023 and 2024?,2022-09-03T14:37:21Z

$ZIM I hope the year end dividend is more  then the stock price at the time its announced.  
 
Dividends like this  are going to be  what reveals the stock market manipulation.  
 
Inflation makes the stock market go up long term not down. The fed has induced a counter cyclical recession that has to reverse eventually and will snap even harder then the covid boom.,2022-09-03T13:52:00Z

$ZIM Lol, too many bag holders on this board, this company is based in Israel which means they love stealing.  
Rates are falling, import and exports are falling and dividends will be completely gone, only direction is just down from here.,2022-09-03T05:57:18Z
With a price book ratio of 0.79, $ZIM is valued rather cheaply. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/ZIM/fundamental-analysis?key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-09-03T03:33:00Z
$ZIM Posted this on a gentleman&#39;s post below, but thought it could help some people understand the bear case. It&#39;s not that complicated; Supply is ridiculous. Can play all these games like global recession, goods spending, imports, China, congestion, whatever, but if you have an abundance of supply most shipping companies will end up losing money. The stocks do not price past earnings, they price future earnings. It&#39;s probable that future earnings will be bad until enough scrapping takes place to balance the fleet. This process usually takes a minimum of a few years, often much much longer. The cash on the balance sheet might be enough to last until the next bull cycle, it might not.  GL.  
 
&quot;I&#39;m sure the fleet will completely absorb a record orderbook with no problems. The economy will grow by over 30% in a few years, these guys will suddenly stop ordering ships for some reason, and all the environmental regulations will do more than even the most bullish shipping CEO claims. GL.&quot;,2022-09-03T03:00:44Z
