- Earnings, dividend and forward guidance to be announced within in 34 trading days. 
- Short interest is at all time high above 20% of float (Shares sold Short are future buying). 
- Book value $48.04/sh, more than double current stock price. 
- Cash on hand now approx $30/sh increases LBO possibility. 
- Current stock price is down 80% from the high so Risk/Reward strongly favors ZIM.

$ZIM I think it&#39;s about to get entertaining here. I&#39;m just going to sit here, holding my shares and collecting cash while I watch the house of cards fall as everyone realizes this company has a boatload of cash and is still making money despite the headwinds. What will they do with all that money? Give it to the shareholders of course.,2023-01-20T21:57:02Z
$ZIM month over month inflation in Canada just went negative. Lots of talk about lowering rates. Lots of talk about over doing it with interest rates.  
 
If I was a short seller I would be covering everything right now.  
 
These people are insane. Go short tesla or something instead jeez.  
 
If the FED pivots it won&#39;t be a gradual comeback. It&#39;s going to be a face ripper as everyone who is sitting on cash will be qued to go back in again at the same time short sellers get pants&#39;d  and can&#39;t get out.  
 
There is a lot of cash sitting in peoples accounts right now. Everyone is waiting for the right time, whatever that means.,2023-01-20T21:43:03Z
