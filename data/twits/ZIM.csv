$ZIM  The smart money is buying here... Look at they key institutions that were loading in Q2... BLK, RT, SS, Citadel, MM, MS, and GS... You can bet that if they thought it was a buy in Q2, that they&#39;re loading up down here in make-believe land...,2022-09-01T01:37:26Z

$ZIM  Q3 is a seasonally strong quarter for marine shipping... Especially for container shipping... Path of least resistance is higher...,2022-09-01T01:14:07Z
$ZIM GSL surged about 11% yesterday because the market is undervaluing container shipping names... Like ZIM... Only ZIM is much more deeply undervalued than GSL was yesterday before it broke-out... ZIM is deeeeeeeeeelply undervalued here...,2022-09-01T01:13:26Z
$ZIM  Buying here gets you long established, world class operator for essentially nothing... That&#39;s why it&#39;s very likely that private equity is positioning here... They generally avoid the shipping sector like the plague... But they&#39;re sooooo starved for yield and deep value,  they&#39;re actively positioning to take over shipping sector operators like ZIM... ZIM is probably the most buyable shipping sector name with staying power... They have no net debt, it&#39;s trading at cash on-hand, and it&#39;s metrics are showing deeply undervalued forward valuations... Their model is flexible and their structure is streamlined and efficient...,2022-09-01T01:12:59Z
$ZIM Bottom feeders are going to get squeezed soon... I thought today might be the day, but it looks like the market is going to give them just a bit more rope before it crushes them like a bug.... : ),2022-09-01T01:12:25Z

$ZIM I buy this fomo-induced pig if it reache  $21,50. Otherwise what&#39;s the point..,2022-08-31T22:47:51Z
$ZIM  A week ago the story was it&#39;s going lower only  because of the dividend. 
 
This does not look like that.  
 
More importantly, stick to you plan. Opinions will always be around. Don’t worry about being right. Have a plan, understanding the risk you’re willing to take. It’s your money.

But does Shell sell  ships ? Haha, say that sentence loud 10 times rapidly :-) ..Or do they have these vessels and buy LNG bunkering... Or will they convert existing vessels..??,2022-08-31T20:15:12Z
