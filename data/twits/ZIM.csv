$ZIM haha. Well I was really close on the prediction. Ended right where I thought it would.,2023-01-26T02:45:34Z
$ZIM great play today bought 5k @ 17.70 sold @ 18.20  . still need to close first gap at 24 then around 40,2023-01-26T01:10:25Z
$ZIM Nice action is right! Love how they hit hard in the morning pounding the bid with 500,000 shrs in the first 30 minutes to scare the Cit out of everyone. Then the rest of the day buying back 3 Million + shares right into the close at a discount, a few hundred or a few thousand at a time. Love watching them work! 
I wonder what the play book will be tomorrow?  I got plenty of dry powder ready, locked and loaded.  We were victorious in the prolonged epic battle of 17.50 and the assault of 18.80 promises to be even more thrilling!  We will win this battle as well!

$ZIM what‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs opinion on the dividend? I think this company has reached the bottom and will eventually leg up towards the mid 20‚Äôs, but everyone knows this is a jewel for the dividend payout.

Thoughts?,2023-01-25T23:57:56Z
$ZIM Well I just bought a big bag. I fundamentally believe this is the bottom for this stock and the chart says it. I am not a fan of this company&#39;s past and moral ambiguity from before 2000, but that was a long time ago so I will give them the benefit of the doubt. Shipping rates are stabilizing and as soon as Inflation begins to cool we are going to see some crazy stuff happen here. 
Low might be $14 (unlikely), but should turn around to $20+ soon, excluding the massive dividend (will likely not be as big as previous temporarily, but it will still be large).,2023-01-25T23:34:03Z
$ZIM I want to buy but MAN if you know about the shit they pulled before 9/11 it makes me unsure if I can do it morally.

$ZIM One day analysts claim the market is great the next day it&#39;s doom and gloom while they take your money: 10:34 ET - The Bank of Canada&#39;s forecast has final domestic demand--or a measure of consumption by households, businesses and governments--decelerating sharply in 2023, as the effect of higher rates weighs on activity. BOC lifted its main rate by a quarter point today to 4.50%, or 4.25 percentage points higher than a year ago. BOC expects data will show annualized growth stalling starting in 4Q22 and expects that to last until 3Q23. Its forecast has final domestic demand climbing a meager 0.6%, versus a 2.9% increase in 2022 and 6% jump in 2021. BOC says household spending will remain subdued in 2023, with interest payments on mortgages, as a share of after-tax income, climbing. (paul.vieira@wsj.com; @paulvieira),2023-01-25T15:52:08Z

NYSE Says &#39;Manual Error&#39; Caused Tuesday&#39;s Glitch -- WSJ 
Today 10:30 AM ET (Dow Jones)Print 
By Alexander Osipovich 
The New York Stock Exchange said a manual error caused Tuesday morning&#39;s glitch that led to wild prices and temporary trading halts in dozens of stocks such as McDonald&#39;s and Walmart. 
In an update] posted Wednesday morning, the exchange said the glitch--a failure to conduct the standard opening auction that determines official start-of-day prices for NYSE-listed stocks--affected 2,824 securities. That number, more than the NYSE had [previously disclosed  comprises the majority of securities listed on the Big Board. 
   -- About 84 of the impacted securities experienced trading halts under a  
      market mechanism that temporarily freezes trading in stocks facing  extreme volatility, the NYSE said.,2023-01-25T15:48:53Z
