Carriers pivot on the fly as Asia‚ÄìUS spot rates plummet 
Bill Mongelluzzo, Senior Editor | Sep 30, 2022 4:34PM EDT 
Spot rates in the eastbound trans-Pacific are dropping so quickly ‚Äî and by such large amounts ‚Äî that industry analysts warn carriers could soon be carrying containers at a loss.

Time for trust 
That said, the industry has to bear in mind that this month‚Äôs, and upcoming, rates falls should be seen in a context of a market that‚Äôs been in overdrive for a sustained period of time, Berglund stressed. 
 
Despite the decline, the XSI is currently 112% higher than it was in September 2021. 
 
‚ÄúSo much of the focus has been on profits and performance,‚Äù Berglund said, ‚Äúbut it might be helpful to move to an atmosphere of establishing trust and building solid relationships between stakeholders. That attitude would certainly help around the negotiating table.‚Äù 
 
Alongside painting a global picture of the latest rates developments, the XSI also delivers detailed insights into regional markets. And, in a stark contrast to recent months, almost all key benchmarks point down for September.
