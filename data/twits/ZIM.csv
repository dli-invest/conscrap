@Outlaw15 @MuffinMantheMan @BigBalla01 
Depends on your broker.  I got paid the same day on my $ZIM dividends (via Fidelity) which was comprised of dividends paid direct via the company and those paid by the seller (via ‚Äúdue bills‚Äù).  IF you‚Äôre with E*Trade - Good Luck! Maybe you get paid by next week. ü§£ü§£,2023-04-17T13:05:48Z
$ZIM guys do you entitled dividend for shares closed on 31 March 2023?,2023-04-17T12:25:40Z
$ZIM If you hold this stock for the next 5 to 10 years it will feel like you have a kind, rich uncle who sends you a large sum of money each quarter. At some stage over the next few years we will see a cyclical upturn in seafreight rates and Zim will return to the days of paying $30 per share in annual dividends.,2023-04-17T12:21:26Z
