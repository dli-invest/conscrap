$ZIM   Plan &quot;A&quot; got em 1M+ short shares covered last week. Short interest is currently 13.5M shares to cover in 13 trading days because they know, and we know it too. that earnings will be &gt;$9/sh and div will be &gt;$3/sh.  Any news of freight rates showing signs of stabilizing would be a very powerful catalyst, doubling ZIM PPS or more.,2022-10-29T23:04:41Z
$ZIM The play book that worked last week of hitting the bid hard in the morning and then accumulating on the bid at lower prices will NOT work come Monday thru Nov 16th. When that gets figured out, plan B for shorts covering will be panic buying. That usually leads to MoMo (Momentum traders) buyers coming in, which ends up as my favorite thing of all, being short squeeze.,2022-10-29T22:40:16Z

$ZIM This is from the Seeking Alpha article below: 
 
These are quotes from the article: &quot;We are of the opinion that current levels offer investors with an extremely attractive risk/ reward ratio, given the potentially rich dividend payout of $10.81 by FQ4&#39;22.&quot;  
  
&quot;Nonetheless, consensus estimates remain bullish about ZIM&#39;s prospects, given their price target of $55.00 and a 90.97% upside from current prices.&quot;
