$ZIM The Israeli owners are likely short selling their own company back to IPO level ($15), and making a ton of money on the way down. Maybe they take it private at that level, or they change their position and go long on the way back up; of course, they are doing this in cohort with their favorite investment bankers. Fairly common practice in certain corners.  Zip your pockets folks.,2022-09-08T00:59:19Z

$ZIM wish we could have the same shareholders as GME.  They lose 35 cents a share and people drive the price up 12 percent.  We make 11 dollars a share and go down 39 percent and have half the market cap as GameStop.  If this stuff continues the markets going to crash.
