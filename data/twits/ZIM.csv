$ZIM  Only 3 more trading four more trading days until dividend payout day.  What do you think that day (or the day after) will look like with over $2 Billion of dividends reinvested in this stock over a two day period. 
 
Most people want to DRIP and most newbies don&#39;t even know what that means.  The stock trades about $420 million per day.  What happens when an additional 5X of that gets poured into this stock at market on dividend payout day. 
 
That is precisely why you will see a big run up in this stock over the next four days.  Everyone knows that next Tuesday and Wednesday are about the surest opportunity any of us will ever get to see a stock triple in a two day period.

$ZIM where do we see this by end of year? My average is around 71.50 area. Also, I see no reference in my brokerage account as to any impending dividend payout. I had 10k shares as of ex dividend. Will dividend just show up in few days minus Israel taxes?,2022-03-29T00:49:42Z

Oh, looky here. Guess who&#39;s coming to dinner? Why, it&#39;s none other than King Coal. And, just to think, 3 months ago it was so unloved. How fickle lovers can be.

Coal will help solve the European Union‚Äôs current energy price squeeze, even while the Russia-Ukraine crisis is expected overall to speed up actions towards the energy transition, participants in a shipping panel at the FT Commodities Global Summit said. 
 
‚ÄúThe only commodity that can help solve the energy crisis in Europe in the short term is coal,‚Äù said Sveinung Stohle, deputy CEO of Greek-based shipping company Angelicoussis Group. ‚ÄúLike it or not, coal will play a very important role.‚Äù

$ZIM Riddle me this? On 3/21, the day before ex-div, over $30MM in calls were traded mostly after the market closed. These calls would theoretically be worth $17/call less on the market open and there is no indication of them being traded the next day or any day after. What do you think happened?

$ZIM Last Thursday and Friday were obviously a difficult pullback but today&#39;s performance was very revealing.  We are now back to a level that is positive post-dividend.  Next week is a huge cash infusion for many of us, and I project a good % of that $ is going right back into this equity.  Let&#39;s continue to hold strong, this company is massively undervalued.,2022-03-28T22:44:55Z

$ZIM I was a little upset with myself for buying at 72.25$ after it dropped later that day to 68$. But nice bounce on indicators and off of midline support of channel. Feeling better about my entry right now. Hoped it holds.,2022-03-28T19:21:27Z

$ZIM how long can these elevated shipping prices last? Once they end of get cut this stock will drop hard. Thoughts?,2022-03-28T18:22:32Z
$ZIM i like this. I bailed at 70.90 on the way down and cut my losses and it seemed the right call when it was 68. But I knew it would recover, I just had to do something and couldn‚Äôt wait. But these lessons in even small patience will make me better in the future. So stick it to me Zim and soar, don‚Äôt just show me I was wrong but show me how wrong!,2022-03-28T18:15:26Z
