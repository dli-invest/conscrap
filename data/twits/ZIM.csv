$ZIM FBX Overview
Asia-US West Coast prices (FBX01 Daily) increased 14% to $13,935/FEU. This rate is 97% higher than the same time last year.

Asia-US East Coast prices (FBX03 Daily) were unchanged at $15,963/FEU, and are 113% than rates for this week last year.

Despite efforts to restart manufacturing, the seven-week lockdown in Shanghai has sent export volumes plummeting. In response to dropping demand for freight, ocean carriers have continued to cancel a significant number of sailings out of Asia.

This additional reduction in capacity may have contributed to Asia - US West Coast rates climbing this week, though prices remain 16% lower than before the lockdown in early March, and Asia - North Europe rates remain 21% lower, both at levels not seen since last summer.

But authorities in Shanghai have just announced that the city will begin reopening in the coming days with aims for a gradual return to normal by late June.,2022-05-18T21:16:04Z
