When is dividend and how much?,2022-05-20T21:25:37Z
$ZIM Next week the market is due for a correction (the good kind.)  With all the positivity around this company, fast approaching ex-div, we should be in for an excellent week.  Two weeks ago today I was extremely bullish and got burned, followed by some moments of redemption.  We&#39;re basically even over the past two weeks, which is an impressive feat.  Every time we get burned we keep coming back, amidst the firestorm of this market!  As soon as that storm subsides we are destined to seriously push up.  If fundamentals matter, and I still believe and trust they do!,2022-05-20T21:04:27Z
$ZIM what‚Äôs the EPS Ttm for this stock I can‚Äôt find any updated information since their earnings?,2022-05-20T20:58:42Z
The top 10 largest ocean carriers in 2000 commanded 51% of the market; today, a whopping 80% &amp; all are based outside the US.  
 
In effort to control (inflate) prices, mega-shippers have organized into 3 major container shipping alliances: 2M, The Alliance &amp; Ocean Alliance. Deep in the fine print of cargo shipping contracts, these alliances can cancel ‚Äî or have ‚Äúblank sailings‚Äù ‚Äî if demand has slumped. More canceled sailings mean less capacity for cargo, and likely higher rates. 
 
Further, ship sizes continue to grow - the largest ship class of a given year has increased by 50% from 2012 to today, or nearly sixfold from 1981 to today. The largest container ships to be delivered this year have a max capacity of 24,000 TEUs &amp; named &quot;Ever Alot&quot; (the same shipping company that blocked the Suez Canal&quot;. Larger ships simply squeezed out smaller ships/companies. 
 
Lastly, these mega-ships are too large for most ports leading to congestion!!
