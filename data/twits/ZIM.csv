$ZIM You will find a link here to submit a complaint about your broker to the NYSE: https://www.nyse.com/regulation/complaints-and-inquiries 
 
According to the NYSE due-bills only apply to shares that were sold before the ex-div date. They exist so that the dividend may be passed to the new buyer. If your broker uses due-bills as an excuse for not paying you, they are being dishonest and probably don&#39;t want to give the true explanation (which might be that they loaned your shares out and have to wait for a short seller to pony up the dividend. 
 
If you write to NYSE, I suggest you also post a copy to your broker.,2023-04-07T03:39:58Z

$ZIM I know some others are looking for a few divy stocks to build their long side. Here&#39;s an idea for ulya. Hope it helps.. ec. Ecopetrol. It&#39;s an oil company. Pays good divys. Has been beat down with oil prices. And oil will do nothing but go up from here out as Saudi and world politics play the oil battle game.  Unlike pbr is not tied to Brazil govt. Entry on dips below 10. It&#39;s good to be spread around a bit. And long term looks good. Hope this helps.,2023-04-07T01:51:06Z

$ZIM For &quot;investors&quot; looking for a long-term growth company that is a market disruptor, this could be the company. $ZIM has solid operating metrics.  Once their transition happens expect the numbers to grow with solid divs.  To be realistic the stock in 2023 will probably be in the $12-14 range at the current P/E but if they are valued fairly $ZIM would grow to $20-$30 range at a typical P/E of 2-3 like other shipping companies.  This company has better metrics than most other shippers but without the heavy burden of debt and assets.  They can react quicker and since they don&#39;t have heavy ownership in vessels &amp; they can limit losses on shipping and can more easily take advantage of more profitable routes and markets.  For me, this is a long-term play.  I am personally upsidedown on the stock price because I initially jumped at the div last year, however I see value long terms.  Go read $ZIM guidance reports and be realistic.   2/2,2023-04-06T22:33:59Z
$ZIM my 401k auto drop hit at $19.13

$ZIM Market (including shorts) are reacting to the guidance given by $ZIM.   $ZIM says they are going from $6.1Bn Adj EBIT to $100-$500 Mn in Adj-EBIT for 2023.  Huge drop.  Even with the increased shipping rates, that is an increase from a lower rate but nowhere close to all-time highs that drove 2021 and 2022 results. The shorts see a big juicy profit to be made off a stock that will have lower near-term prospects.  $ZIM is clearly changing its business model from an asset-heavy model to an asset-light, technology-based, and nimble organization.  They will be able to react better to market changes through their ability to stop, limit or add leases according to the market.  This, for all purposes, is a new/young company.  They have been around since 1945 but this business model is less than 4 years old.  This shift will take a few years to entrench but then will continually improve over time.  For those that are in it just for the div it will be a tough year in 2023.  1/2,2023-04-06T22:30:59Z
$ZIM I don&#39;t have DRIP on because I can always just buy the stocks at a lower price myself. Keep that in mind when wanting to reinvest dividends.,2023-04-06T22:23:18Z

I ONLY buy when Algos are tired of selling. How? I buy when &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; is low.
I don&#39;t make 100s of trades. I only buy when I get a confirmation. Ask me for the receipts. 

Next, I&#39;ll trade $ATVI + $CRWD + $SNOW + $ZIM + $NVAX,2023-04-06T19:27:05Z

$ZIM 

Are you seeking a global value and income stock? 

The shipping industry has business risk: if a country and it&#39;s Docks and ship channels go into lock down. This creates a short collapse period followed by a spike. It occurred with COVID 19. Container prices jumped due to this event. There is currently a price contraction period for dry ship containers. It explains much of the Zim price swing from $71.40 to $16.

Zim has a PE ratio of .45. This is an extreme value stock. The market cap is $2.317 billion. Zim has weekly options. These frequently are not worth selling around the ex-dividend date. The stock is great without option income during those times.

ZIM Shipping is an Israeli transportation sector stock paying 72% annual dividends. 25% of the dividend is paid to Israel. It results in a net dividend of 54%, excluding your sovereign annual income tax. The resulting income is attractive and will hold up for the upcoming year. The Israeli tax is paid on Roth or 401K.,2023-04-06T19:21:47Z

$ZIM QT at its finestüôÑ

‚ÄúThank you for raising your concerns!

After inquiring further with my internal teams regarding this, they have shared that the dividends have been paid out to Questrade, and we are in the midst of organizing the allocations to each client that was eligible for the dividend. 

They have confirmed that you will see this reflected in your account by April 11th, 2023 due to the Holiday this weekend.‚Äù,2023-04-06T18:30:34Z
