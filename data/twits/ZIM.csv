My alerts for LARGE caps. I have timestamps + buy fills for everything What&#39;s my win rate?

I ONLY buy when Algos are tired of selling. How? I buy when &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; is low.
I don&#39;t make 100s of trades. I only buy when I get a confirmation. Ask me for the receipts. 

Next, I&#39;ll trade $ATVI + $CRWD + $SNOW + $ZIM + $NVAX,2023-04-12T19:26:50Z
$ZIM Anyone else sell their position after dividend post on 4/3 then have their dividend revoked? They took their taxes though. 🤔,2023-04-12T19:11:22Z
$ZIM Net asset value is $43 per share. Any price under $43 is a steal, kindly facilitated by the short sale manipulators who have no regard for strong fundamentals.,2023-04-12T18:59:05Z
Compared to an average industry PE Ratio of 2.80, $ZIM is valued rather cheaply. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/ZIM/fundamental-analysis?key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2023-04-12T18:51:00Z

$ZIM the level for today currently is an MM false move down from highs of the day because all the money managers and such are on the GOLF COURSE,2023-04-12T18:06:54Z
$ZIM on DIVIDEND expectation...Considering the FACT: that all shipping indexes are up 270% since the EPS guidance was issued I&#39;m seeing another div around the $2.70-$3.20 mark my words...also there is a buzz the board is exploring a stock BUY BACK to the tune of 10million total!!!! that will send this too the MOON alice!!! anyone heard of the true-up dividend to occur shortly, this is thge money SHORTS had to PAY holding it short....because the board issued $6.40 per share, this is 19mill shares X&#39;s $6.40 that shorts had to payout...maybe they will tack it on to the $3.20 this june,2023-04-12T18:05:20Z

$SPY bottom dropped out, attempting some recovery. Sold half those puts for a little over 50%, holding the rest in hopes that the Fed minutes carry the same sentiment as CPI. Not expecting any fireworks though. 70% chance of a 25 point hike is already priced in.
