$ZIM Someone please explain to me. 
If most of the declines in the prices of many stocks that are taking place in the markets, it is due to the excessive valuation (PER) that many companies were having that have lowered their PER from 100 times to less than half in many cases How is it that the market does not reward ZIM that currently has a PER of 1.70 and a strong revenue forecast with even better results for 2022?,2022-05-11T21:44:20Z

Container lines remain on track for their best year ever in 2022, given much higher contract rates and still strong (albeit moderating) spot rates. Lessors of container ships are also on track for a banner year, locking in virtually all of their vessels on charters at historically high rates. 
 
On Monday, shares of container line operator Zim (NYSE: ZIM) sank 10%. Zim‚Äôs share price is now back to where it started the year. Across the container sector, much of 2022‚Äôs gains have been lost. 
 
Global Ship Lease (NYSE: GSL), one of the companies that rent container ships to liners, reported Monday that its Q1 2021 net income was up 1,571% year on year. It now has $1.67 billion in revenue locked in through charters. And yet, following Monday‚Äôs decline, GSL‚Äôs stock is down 7% year to date.,2022-05-11T19:03:29Z

$ZIM any thoughts here for next ER.  China was pretty much lock down.  Not much to ship.   
 
Earnings for Asia Pacific routes should decrease.

$ZIM I DON‚ÄôT want to buy more Zim, I want to diversify and even pick up other shipping stocks in dry bulk as well as lessors and other stocks unrelated to shipping. But, honestly, nothing is producing the cash of Zim and on such a low multiples. The dry bulkers have rallied to their all time highs while Zim is a still cheap. So I have been trading the others on their down days but keep coming back to Zim. As an income investor it just makes sense, I would have to buy a whole lot more of other stuff for anywhere near the income of Zim. If Zim continues to be on sale, I guess I will have to keep accumulating.,2022-05-11T13:00:21Z
