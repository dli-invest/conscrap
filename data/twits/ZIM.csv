$ZIM I donâ€™t have the biggest of positions but since Zim is trading at basically cash on hand, I grabbed 65 more shares at $36.79. Now 258 shares average $45.88. Very content to sit on that.,2022-08-31T04:53:51Z

$ZIM Itâ€™s tempting in these uncertain times to think thereâ€™s a particular investment or asset that will shield your portfolio from losses. Good luck with that. Gold, supposedly a rock of stability, has fallen from its March peak to not much higher than it was a year ago. Bitcoin has lost about one-third of its value since the beginning of the year, with most of the damage happening in the past six weeks.,2022-08-31T02:54:21Z
$ZIM LOTS of puts sold recently.  Looks like the bottom is close if not already here.  Question is where will they bounce this to?  Gap fill at $47?,2022-08-31T02:49:48Z

$ZIM ZIM ain&#39;t going up until the S &amp; P 500 starts going up. Until then, about $30 it will drop to.  Very simple folks!,2022-08-31T02:17:32Z
$ZIM Just doing some research on this, I&#39;ve done contracting work for ZIM in Canada and know the company well. What I&#39;m trying to understand are the dividends, they look outstanding. Also why the retrace over the past few days. I can&#39;t seem to find any news???,2022-08-31T01:53:23Z

$ZIM fuck this stock. Cut my losses on this one today. Wished I cut it at 40 instead of 37.9. Might re enter later but this horrible price action the last 3 days really pissed me off.,2022-08-31T00:36:11Z
$ZIM Israeli Bank Increased their Interest rate 75 basis points. That could be one reason this is in the tank. Anyway I sold 300 shares, no more for me. I Lost a total of 12,000 on this stock. I had this and kept averaging down @ $68.00. get a tax refund next year anyway. lol.,2022-08-31T00:07:57Z
$ZIM when my projected 33.50 hits, I guess I&#39;ll move the view to 29.50.,2022-08-30T23:33:50Z

$ZIM Bought more - they have a ton of cash flow. This is trading low because of China hick-ups. Obviously China economy will impact shipping. But it trades too low.,2022-08-30T21:37:30Z

$ZIM this stock is a money pit. Will never climb out of this shit hole. Sure it makes sense for the executives with big stakes to pay out a massive dividend each quarter when they have a shit ton of shares and arenâ€™t planning on selling them anytime soon cuz they make oh idk a couple million in salary ever year anyway so this lines their pocket quarterly and the shares they hold were free to get anyway. Fuck this company and this stock. Iâ€™m suing them tomorrow.,2022-08-30T20:36:44Z
$ZIM Don&#39;t get suck in just yet. Wait for it... $32 and possible high $20&#39;s looking very likely,2022-08-30T20:31:30Z

$ZIM Valuations are never good chart timing tools, but they do correlate highly with future returns. This thing is basically priced for bankruptcy while bankruptcy is also virtually impossible. No debt, just lease obligations that they could likely break with some sort of fee if the world was ending and shipping wasn&#39;t needed. 
 
Even projecting for pre-covid clusterfuck revenues from 9/19 to 6/20, they averaged around 820M (ie, a 76% decline), and when taking average percentage COGS for fuel, handling of containers, and slots, they would average ~560M per quarter in earnings, or yearly estimate of ~18.8 EPS.  
 
That puts this thing at a 1.95 &quot;forward&quot; PE with absolutely catastrophic revenue projections. It literally doesn&#39;t get cheaper than this. 
 
Shorts, and capitulating retail will learn a lesson on this one. 
 
Leveraging up now. Candle action doesn&#39;t indicate a reversal, but 28.2 RSI(14) says we are getting really close. Even if we aren&#39;t it is certifiably cheap at these levels,2022-08-30T20:12:50Z
$ZIM so if it&#39;s trading at 10 dollars and they announce a 10 dollar dividend does it go to zero on the ex dividend date just preparing for the worst lol,2022-08-30T20:12:49Z
