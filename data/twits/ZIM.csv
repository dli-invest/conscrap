$ZIM Posted this on a gentleman&#39;s post below, but thought it could help some people understand the bear case. It&#39;s not that complicated; Supply is ridiculous. Can play all these games like global recession, goods spending, imports, China, congestion, whatever, but if you have an abundance of supply most shipping companies will end up losing money. The stocks do not price past earnings, they price future earnings. It&#39;s probable that future earnings will be bad until enough scrapping takes place to balance the fleet. This process usually takes a minimum of a few years, often much much longer. The cash on the balance sheet might be enough to last until the next bull cycle, it might not.  GL.  
 
&quot;I&#39;m sure the fleet will completely absorb a record orderbook with no problems. The economy will grow by over 30% in a few years, these guys will suddenly stop ordering ships for some reason, and all the environmental regulations will do more than even the most bullish shipping CEO claims.

$ZIM  Nice aftermarket price action... : ),2022-09-03T02:28:03Z
$ZIM  Ignore the shorters... They have no facts, no analysis, and no cognitive reasoning to support their hype... I was going to say thesis, but hype isn&#39;t really a thesis... Not to mention they&#39;re essentially done here... And they know it... Monday&#39;s coming... : ),2022-09-03T02:26:35Z
$ZIM  Shipping rates on most (not all) routes are moving lower, as projected by everyone on earth 6 months ago... This is not some kind of revelation here... Again, what&#39;s important, is accurately forecasting the glide path...,2022-09-03T02:23:58Z
$ZIM  ZIM does not have a fixed div, it&#39;s variable, and everyone knows it will not be anywhere near current levels going forward...  The glide path is what&#39;s important...,2022-09-03T02:21:59Z
$ZIM Hmm what is the advantage of a high dividend stock if they take it out of the stock price? I mean, I can sell the stock and get cash at any time, and not pay taxes to a foreign country. what am I missing here? Is it the hype until the ex-divi date? This is an honest question; I really cannot figure it out. Can someone please explain it to me ü§î,2022-09-03T02:04:22Z
$ZIM  
 
Shipping rates are moving lower. After peaking in 2021 rates have fallen considerably in 2022. 
 
Plus, that large dividend is doomed.,2022-09-03T00:13:23Z
$ZIM going back to ipo price,2022-09-03T00:07:15Z
$ZIM the short analysis is that this management is just going to lease ships that can‚Äôt make them money. That they‚Äôll squander billions. That they‚Äôre incompetent buffoons. Even if this is the case, they still need global shipping to implode and stay that way for years until Zim runs out of cash. Wayyyy too many ifs,2022-09-03T00:04:58Z

$ZIM  What&#39;s clear right now is that ZIM is suuuuuper cheeeeeap.... For 2023 is still very cheap, and for 2024 it&#39;s slightly undervalued... But a lot can happen between now and 2024 that could very well shift in ZIM&#39;s favor... If it&#39;s not taken private before then...,2022-09-02T22:44:16Z
$ZIM  $GSL  I just read an independent analyst report on the container shipping sector which outlines a very probable scenario where a group of private equity firms buy-up ZIM, GSL , and several other privately held players to build another heavyweight...,2022-09-02T22:41:02Z
$ZIM   After cash, the business is essentially priced at zero here, which is why it&#39;s very likely that private equity is positioning here... They generally avoid the shipping sector like the plague... But they&#39;re sooooo starved for yield and deep value,  they&#39;re actively positioning to take over shipping sector operators like ZIM... ZIM is probably the most buyable shipping sector name with staying power... They have no net debt, it&#39;s trading at cash on-hand, and it&#39;s metrics are showing deeply undervalued forward valuations... Their model is flexible and their structure is streamlined and efficient...,2022-09-02T22:37:40Z
