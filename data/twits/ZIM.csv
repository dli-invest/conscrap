$ZIM New to this stock; just wondering the reason for the massive drop back in Mar 2022. Also, why such a high short interest in this dividend paying stock? Cramer back in January 2023 said that he does not trust this company. Not that I give much stock to what Cramer says, but I wanted to know more from those who are here in this stock for long.,2023-02-06T19:19:13Z
