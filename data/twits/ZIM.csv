I just see lower expenses and higher profits. ZIM LNG fleet!,2023-04-14T01:20:00Z
@Dads_IRA $ZIM Sorry for the typo,2023-04-14T01:10:55Z
$ZIM   Some comforting math n stuff..

- ZIM pays just under 75% of its profits out in dividends. 
-  If ZIM earns 250M per Q (1B per year), divvy payout will be 750M
- 750M divided by 120M total shares = a bit over $6 per share in annual divvy income
- $20 investment pays $6 annually is 30% return in just dividends. 😂😂

** all prev Q’s net income:  451M, 1.1B, 1.3B. 1.7B, 1.4B, 886M, 587M, 365M, 144M, 25M, -13M, -400K for 12/31/19

I forgive the early on GAAP losses given they were near the time of their IPO. Everything I’ve read and observed tells me these guys know what they’re doing.  Insiders own 22%, a very nice alignment of interest where the divvy is concerned.  

I think this stock suffers from the appearance of a value trap but I don’t believe it is and I’m building this to 5% of The IRA and I’ll bet this pick kicks ass over the next 3-4 yrs (if I can avoid the temptation to trade).,2023-04-14T00:40:25Z

&quot;While it is true that Zim is likely to experience a hefty drop-off from both a top- and bottom-line standpoint this year, the stock is arguably being valued as if the company is in deep financial trouble. Nothing could be further from the truth.  
 
In its latest earnings report, Zim&#39;s management highlighted the fact that the company ought to generate an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of between $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion in 2023. That amount definitely qualifies as a fairly healthy and robust business even if it does represent a sharp drop-off from the company&#39;s pandemic highs over the course of 2021 to 2022. Turning to the specifics, Zim posted adjusted EBITDA of $7.54 billion in 2022 and $6.60 billion in 2021.&quot;,2023-04-13T18:41:33Z
