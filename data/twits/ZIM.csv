$ZIM I bought a whole bunch more at 62.45. I keep my principle shares. Then I just sell off of margin the shares that I buy at the lower price when it goes back up over 64 or so. Seems to work ok the P/E is at 1.33 I just can&#39;t imagine the P/E being at 1.00. Is there a stock with such a low P/E???,2022-06-01T22:40:03Z

$ZIM this stock has been at the ICU and recovering nicely. All will be alright. Re-invest on your dividends because you will never see 64 again.,2022-06-01T19:50:28Z
$ZIM I have to admit; I thought the share price could go down to $50/share. I held on based on ZIM&#39;s business model. Buying new LPG ships was big for me. They smartly grabbed leases when others turned down ship lease renewals base on the economy. ZIM made me think of Warren Buffet during the banking crisis. Buffet bought up multiple financial institutions dirt cheap while everyone else bailed out.,2022-06-01T19:43:46Z
$ZIM&#39;s PE Ratio is rather cheap when compared to the industry average which is at 4.77. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/analyzer/stock/ZIM?view=fundamental-analysis&amp;key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-06-01T19:35:00Z

Zim to hand back transpacific workhorse as carriers review expensive charters  
By Mike Wackett 30/05/2022 
 
Shipbroker Braemar ACM reports that the 8,814 teu Northern Jasper, which, according to eeSea data, is one of 10 vessels deployed on Zim’s ZCP, Maersk’s TP10 and MSC’s Amberjack Asia to US east coast Panama loop, has been extended for just one more round-trip at a huge $175,000 a day. 
 
However, Zim has denied that it arranged the charter extension at this rate: “We have extended its charter contract for a price which is completely different, and cheaper, than the one stated,” a spokesman told The Loadstar. 
 
“When we renew a charter, when we fix a vessel, the average charter duration is between three and five years,” said Zim CFO Xavier Destriau, adding that he did not consider Zim too exposed to the spot charter market, and that the carrier must “leave room” for the arrival of the 46 long-term chartered newbuilds being delivered in 2023 and 2024.
