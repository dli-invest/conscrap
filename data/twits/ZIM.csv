$ZIM I‚Äôm new to dividend paying stocks. Noticed that ZIM will be paying 17$ per share on April 4. If I buy shares on April 3rd can I still get the dividend ? Please assist. Thanks.,2022-03-17T04:46:17Z

$ZIM is this one the best stock across the whole fucking market? It should have 100 out of 100 in relative strength rating,2022-03-16T21:17:58Z
$ZIM so this only goes up or what?,2022-03-16T21:17:22Z
$ZIM this will double in the next 6 months. They‚Äôre literally projecting $7bn in net income this year, and the company is only valued at $10bn?

Throwing out 17-20% dividends?

Wildly undervalued. They will pay out like 50% dividends in the next year, which is fucking insane.,2022-03-16T20:43:50Z
$ZIM the one that got away! This stock is killing me! üòÇCongrats to all $ZIM longs! üéâüçæ,2022-03-16T20:41:18Z
$ZIM bought more today during Powell dip,2022-03-16T20:41:00Z
$ZIM  
 
Correct me if I am wrong. When they went ex div on August 24 the stock closed the previous day, Aug 23, at 47.30. 
 
On Aug 24 then the stock closed at 46.75. 
 
Two weeks later the stock was at 60. 
 
All signs say, BUY THE DIP.
