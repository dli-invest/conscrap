$ZIM I gambled and sold before the dividend but I never expected this big of a collapse over a $2 dividend. I&#39;m back in now with a bigger position because I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll pump this next week so people don&#39;t get a good deal on their drip. This market is insanely rigged...,2022-12-02T04:25:25Z
$ZIM my boomer dad told me to buy this for the insane DIV. When will it bottom?,2022-12-02T02:23:41Z
$ZIM expect this to be shit until they prove that eps wont go negative with declining prices. I strongly believe they&#39;ll be ok, than sp should start to correct,2022-12-02T02:06:23Z
$ZIM if you do the math. They are sitting on a cash pile that could pay out up to half of the current price of the stock in dividends after next quarter.

A good addition to the trading plan for the week! $ZIM in Downtrend: its price may drop because broke its higher Bollinger Band on November 11, 2022. View odds for this and other indicators: https://srnk.us/go/4198529,2022-12-01T22:25:22Z

$ZIM guys, last year and 1st half of 2022 when container ship rates went up and ZIM has started with dividends..., everyone wanted to have bigger and bigger divi, just now you say here, that this company is shit and pays too high divi.... this company is still the same, only container ship rates go down. Just now is time to buy tanker copmanies, where the trend is opposite since february 2022 and rates will ho still higher in 2023. The time for containers will come again in 2024/2025,2022-12-01T19:49:05Z
$ZIM all the retarders celebrating lower share prices.  It‚Äôs like losing money is good for them.  We‚Äôre down 5.65 since Friday‚Äôs close and these guys telling us we should be happy campers BECAUSE ITS GOOD WE GET A DIVIDEND.   I like rather have a price of 25 dollars then I would get 2.25.  Did America fail math?  Is that why people think America‚Äôs 32 trillion deficit is manageable with 5 percent interest rates?,2022-12-01T19:43:01Z
$ZIM bankruptcy she is coming for this one hehe,2022-12-01T19:41:35Z
$ZIM learn how to deal with psychological warfare. Collect your dividend, add on dips, and wait for the next dividend, rinse wash and repeat. Fundamentals are great so it&#39;s an easy chill.,2022-12-01T19:15:30Z
$ZIM anyone knows if US taxpayers get reduced rates mentioned in the new tax update ?

$ZIM Management won&#39;t buy back shares. Why? 21% of company owned by Kenon holdings which only pays ~5% taxes on dividends. So you can expect this company to destroy US shareholder value in the future thru divvies as well. At least this is a good sign for Q4 step-up divvies, they&#39;ll be loath to cut it off....,2022-12-01T18:25:03Z
