$ZIM *MUSK SAYS HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH CHINA GOVT. OFFICIALS RECENTLY, SHANGHAI LOCKDOWNS ARE BEING LIFTED RAPIDLY

What&#39;s holding this stock back? You know China won&#39;t be in lockdown forever... 
 
During Drewry‚Äôs most recent outlook for the global container market, Heaney pointed out that high rates for containerized cargo will be dictated by supply chain bottlenecks, ‚Äúwhich, sadly, remain highly unpredictable.‚Äù 
 
Key 2022 contributors to that unpredictability are the Russian invasion of Ukraine and China‚Äôs zero-tolerance COVID-19 strategy that has disrupted cargo movement through such main ports as Shanghai and Shenzhen. 
  
Meanwhile, the overall profit set to be reaped by the global container fleet in 2022 could be as high as US$300 billion. That would be on top of the US$214 billion profit generated by the sector in 2021. 
 
Considering that the 2021 profit for ocean carriers was more than the US$109 billion they generated in all of the previous 20 years, the 2022 total is massive.
