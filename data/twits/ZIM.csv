$ZIM is a good stock - I have owned it in the past.  .  You kids have to learn the difference  between scams like $CTRM and real shipping stocks like $ZIM (and then you can get on to advanced concepts like the difference between bulk carriers and container liners, etc.). 
 
Start with the capital structure.  Whenever the management‚Äôs incentives are not aligned with the common shareholders and/or the management refuses to buy the common shares, you probably have a problem.,2022-10-21T05:54:27Z

$ZIM Keeping an eye on this one. Juicy price here although I see a little down trend. 

Looking for entry around 21-21.5,2022-10-21T00:07:08Z
$ZIM I know everyone is freaking out right now because of current slowdown in entire shipping sector, but facts are still facts.  Market Cap $2.82 Billion, Shareholder Equity = $5.24 Billion, Operating Cash Flow = $3.31 Billion.  Intrinsic value of this company is really around $45.00/Share.,2022-10-20T23:59:34Z

Last divy Sept 8, so next one Dec 8??,2022-10-20T19:34:41Z
$ZIM If profits are projected to go down in 2023 onwards to pre pandemic levels Zim won&#39;t be profitable which could collapse the  future divy payouts.  Im sure if their dividend falls below 5% people will forget about this tock,2022-10-20T19:26:09Z
