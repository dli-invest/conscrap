$ZIM So we get dividend of 6,4$ per share and stock could even drop to 15$ after divvy, sounds like good way to reinvest divs. Even if next div is only 1-2 bucks.,2023-04-02T03:23:07Z

$ZIM - I made a mistake stating that you must own the stock shares by the record date in order to receive the dividend. I was going by the standard rule of dividends which does not apply to this special dividend.
So if you bought after the record date you will receive the dividend. See the rules below that show that you are entitled to the dividend even if you bought after the record date.
Sorry for the mistake.,2023-04-02T01:03:44Z

Last time with a $2.95 div, it dropped from a high of about $26 down to a low of $16.23. 

Wondering if this time with a $6.40 div, it finds a new low between $10-15?,2023-04-02T00:28:27Z

$ZIM Anyone thinking about merger or company buyout? Please check their latest annual report.,2023-04-01T17:38:42Z
$ZIM people trying too hard to overcomplicate what&#39;s going on here . It&#39;s simple...buy and hold. Get the dividend, buy more when it drops after divi, sell(if you want) when the price goes back up for a nice profit or hold long term. Too easy,2023-04-01T17:32:45Z
$ZIM I would only sell if SP goes to 27 and above which i doubt. I think SP will go to 18 after ex and quickly go up to around 21. The unknow ids the 16% shorts. Who knows if they are succesful in driving it down to 15 or so. If they do they will start covering and push up the price again as what happened wh price went from 17 to 25. Just my thoughts, Any views,2023-04-01T16:13:20Z
$ZIM if  your average was $17-19 would you sell before the dividends? Because after paying the 25% tax on the dividend selling the stock at $23-$24 would be more money than what I&#39;d receive with the dividend. Then I could buy back when the stock drops due to dividend payout. Thoughts?,2023-04-01T16:07:11Z
$ZIM : Sold yesterday premarket and will go back long after the div.

Unfortunately, the best way to play ZIM is to play the div hunters.,2023-04-01T15:44:53Z

Based on above i will not sell and i am quite bullish,2023-04-01T15:01:07Z
$ZIM I think the stock will go down to 18 and quickly come to 20 to 21 and stay there more like the other shippers in the mormal course. The only unknown are the 16% of shorter. Why have they not covered as they will have to pay the 6.4 dividend if they don&#39;t. Maybe they had shorted at 40 or 50 and therefore don&#39;t have a problem paying the dividend and getting a few bucks extra by pushing it down hard. This means if 15 is the floor there will be massive short covering at the level, same as what happened when SP went from 17 to 25. Any comments .,2023-04-01T14:52:38Z
$ZIM Phoned Zim&#39;s investor relations. Confirmed, you do NOT get the dividend if you sell Monday and fail to hold through the days completed trading session.,2023-04-01T14:04:40Z
$ZIM  yup üëç,2023-04-01T14:00:04Z
$ZIM Morning, Most Accurate Estimate for the 1Q 2023 Earnings was about 14 days ago -0.93 dollars per share, it has changed to +2.26  dollars per share . So i mean they know something. I think i definitelly  would not sell, because next divi is coming (about +0.70 dollars per share). Very nice.

$ZIM grow up and hold your shares until the company stops issuing dividends, which is not likely on the near future.,2023-04-01T12:49:49Z
