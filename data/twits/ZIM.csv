$ZIM From last conference call in May: &quot;The Company increased its previously provided guidance for the full-year 2022 and now expects to generate Adjusted EBITDA of between $7.8 billion and $8.2 billion and Adjusted EBIT of between $6.3 billion and $6.7 billion.&quot; 
 
&quot;The number of outstanding shares as of March 31, 2022, was 119,810,688.&quot; 
 
So, the lower end of EBIT projection for 2022 is $52.58/share.  The current share price is $48.30. 
 
Cash generated from operations in Q1 2022  was $13.85/share, or about 28% of market cap (in ONE quarter!!), and they have no debt. 
 
I am officially living in bizarro world.,2022-07-28T20:16:30Z

$ZIM once quarter is released I think this trades at p/e of 7. Legit question- are there geopolitical (Israeli) reasons for why this stock is held down compared to peers?,2022-07-28T17:16:47Z
$ZIM $ZIM both bulls and bears have it wrong. Those expecting a home run to $150 bucks are just wrong, on the other hand bears are in my opinion getting ahead by discounting that 2023 is going to be the annus horribilis for these companies. Its not going to be a smooth sailing going back to normal, with rates at $7000 Asia to West coast at the weakest point of the year, to pretend that the stock is going to halve from here is just wishful thinking for shorts. Cramer has no idea how the industry works, he is basically implying that if $ZIM pays $17  when priced at $50, that the stock will go to $25, he has probably seen the price action of the stock and tried to put two and two together. Cramer burnt half of his viewers when recommending $NAT at $8, he even had the audacity to invite the CEO and pounded the table like he only can when the stock was at $7!! I don&#39;t know why people follow him . The way things are $ZIM can easily double from here. Too much negativity on the stock,2022-07-28T16:58:31Z

$ZIM other shipping companies reporting blowout earnings. $NMM that has large containership exposure is flying due to huge share buyback and insanely high rates contracted. I don&#39;t expect anything much different from $ZIM soon.,2022-07-28T13:55:34Z
