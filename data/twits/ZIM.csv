$ZIM Can someone please enlighten me about taxes on Z.I.M. dividends? I hold shares of Z.I.M. in a U.S. Rollover IRA account with Fidelity. I understand that Z.I.M. withholds income taxes on dividends paid and I would like to know if these withheld taxes paid to the U.S. or Israeli governments? Am I going to have to pay taxes to both governments because I must pay U.S. taxes when I withdraw money from my IRA,2022-05-22T15:11:13Z

High container freight rates likely to last well into 2023 
Congestion and supply shortages will continue to drive rates environment 
19 May 2022 
ANALYSIS 
 
James Baker 
@JamesBakerCI james.baker@informa.com 
A normalisation of the box shipping freight environment continues to fade further into the future. Even with inflation slowing demand, a decline in rates is unlikely this year or next,2022-05-21T16:06:43Z
$ZIM  
 
But even if second-half spot-rate declines are extreme, contract rates should come to the rescue. In the trans-Pacific trade, annual contracts often run from May 1 to April 30. Contract rates during the first half of 2022 (signed last year) are much higher than the previous annual rates. And the new contracts that started May 1 are up sharply yet again, which should buoy average rates (including both contract and spot) in the second half of 2022.

According to the latest crowd-sourced data from Xeneta, long-term rates for reefer containers on the key US West Coast to Far East route soared almost 60% in April. 
 
The Oslo-based ocean and air freight benchmarking specialist today reveals a surge in rates of around $2000 per 40‚Äô unit after the latest 12-mo contracts came to a close. The average contracted rate recorded on 5/15 stood at $5850 per container, while the average for new agreements running from Q2 &#39;22 to the end of Q1 2023 was even higher, at $5945 per 40‚Äô reefer. 
 
‚ÄúThis is an almighty increase, pushing prices to an all-time high‚Äù comments Patrik Berglund, Xeneta CEO. ‚ÄúContracts on this trade tend to be for year-long durations, running from the start of April to the end of the following March. With the escalating cost of energy prices, and the recent strength of the market for ocean freight in general, shippers would have expected some pain at the negotiating table.
