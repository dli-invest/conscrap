$ZIM look at the open interest on the Jan 35 and 45 Puts.... what do you make of that,2022-10-24T19:15:56Z
$ZIM Company revenue is roughly TEUs transported x TEU RATE. 
 
From the 2021 annual report: 
 
Revenue                   TEUs     RATE   [TEUs x RATE] 
 
9.7B [2021]               3.5B      2.8k      [9.8B] 
3.5B [2020]               2.8B       1.2k     [3.4B] 
 
Most analysts are predicting disaster due to fall of the RATE parameter, which is actually quite high even now (similar to last year&#39;s average). This depends on the route, but is still nearer $3K than $2K [https://www.drewry.co.uk/supply-chain-advisors/supply-chain-expertise/world-container-index-assessed-by-drewry] 
 
As for TEUs carried, perhaps it will drop below last year&#39;s value, I can&#39;t say. The general trend to Jan 2022 was upwards. https://www.statista.com/statistics/1290630/global-container-ship-teu-capacity-by-trade-route/ 
 
However, I conclude that the 2022 dividends are going to be comparable to last year, and that the analyst focus on the TEU rate at present is misplaced.,2022-10-24T19:05:03Z

$ZIM This is so easy. Watch the DOW. If you feel the DOW is going down then wait; ZIM will follow (for now that is). If the DOW is going up ZIM will follow. As dividend time gets closer ZIM will go up.,2022-10-24T14:27:42Z
