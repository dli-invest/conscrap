$ZIM I just changed my investment company over not getting any reason why they have not paid this dividend.,2023-04-08T20:22:05Z

My alerts for LARGE caps. I have timestamps + buy fills for everything What&#39;s my win rate?

I ONLY buy when Algos are tired of selling. How? I buy when &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; is low.
I don&#39;t make 100s of trades. I only buy when I get a confirmation. Ask me for the receipts. 

Next, I&#39;ll trade $ATVI + $CRWD + $SNOW + $ZIM + $NVAX,2023-04-08T19:26:47Z
$ZIM I need to make a clarification...Earlier I stated that I received the full $6.40/share divi on e-Trade and only $4.80/share on RH. However, as someone on here pointed out, when I clicked on the transaction tab on e-Trade, I was able to see where the 25% had been deducted. What was confusing me was that e-Trade sent me an alert notification that showed the full amount ($6.40/share), making me think the tax had not been withheld, while RH only showed me an alert of the after-tax amount of $4.80/share. Hope this post helps others that may encounter the same thing I did.,2023-04-08T19:14:16Z
$ZIM Enough of this, I didn’t get my dividend shit etc. Let’s focus on the next ER in May and what the next dividend will be, it’s only a two month span not four like this divvy!,2023-04-08T18:15:53Z
