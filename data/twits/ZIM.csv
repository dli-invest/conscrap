$OCCI $ORC $IEP $ZIM $USOI  anyone here that trades on Webull noticed that their charts are reduced by the dividend amounts? So each time a dividend is paid the chart history keeps going lower and lower. Seems like an unnecessary duplicate since they always trade ex-dividend anyway. Just curious if anyone else noticed and / or asked them about it. Thanks!,2023-02-04T03:52:25Z

$ZIM  going to be vulnerable here and ask a dividend question

Wife is pregnant, don‚Äôt make enough to cover one of us working. Have about $40k to figure out what to do with. Can anyone state this pays its dividends and worth the investment?

Cover my $20 calls or let them get called away and hopefully by cheaper next week?,2023-02-03T20:39:07Z
$ZIM this dividend is crazy. Should I assume I&#39;m wrong because it&#39;s showing me 136.59% Divi. That can&#39;t be sustainable. Regardless I think I might stick around and park some money here this year.,2023-02-03T20:35:46Z
$ZIM I could be full of sh*t but today&#39;s move seems like it could be some shorts taking advantage of a blood red day and returning shares.

Eirher way, $25 next week,2023-02-03T20:18:56Z
