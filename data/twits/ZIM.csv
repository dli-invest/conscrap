$ZIM Average analyst estimate for ZIM stock price is $43.34/sh and book value is $43.67/sh. A company being worth its book value is absolutely true by definition of the terms. ZIM is a great company and it&#39;s stock market valuation is badly broken. I like to buy low and sell when it eventually gets overpriced.,2022-11-17T22:25:30Z

$ZIM well, after some research, I have to say, I really like the company.  I bought more today. 400 shares and plan on buying more. Solid company.  25.63 average now. Not too bad.  I feel company is undervalued , should be a much higher per share stock in my opinion.,2022-11-17T21:17:43Z

$ZIM I bought more today. Q3 ER looked solid. YTD the company has generated over $4.2BN in net income and yet has a market cap of $3.2BN. I know freight is normalizing and they won&#39;t be able to charge the exorbitant fees they collected in 2021, but at the same time this company has a PE ratio that&#39;s less than half of shipping industry peers. I guess I&#39;ll keep adding and collecting dividends until the panic sellers are finished.  https://investors.zim.com/news/news-details/2022/ZIM-Reports-Financial-Results-for-the-Third-Quarter-and-First-Nine-Months-of-2022/default.aspx,2022-11-17T20:56:02Z
