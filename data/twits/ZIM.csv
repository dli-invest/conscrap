$ZIM how the hell does JP Morgan upgrade the price to 30.40, but Barclay&#39;s lowers the price target to $15.00. This market is a joke, they&#39;re is no way there is that much of a different price target, even though I would believe JP Morgan well over Barclay&#39;s.,2023-02-17T19:21:38Z

$ZIM Yesterday Zacks basically wrote an off-handed bash &quot;Most-Watched Stock ZIM Integrated Shipping Services Ltd. (ZIM) Worth Betting on Now?&quot;  Today they&#39;re sitting with egg on their face.... OR&gt;&gt;&gt; Did they try to bring the stock down in order to get in at a lower price?  Looks like blatant manipulation.... YOU BET I&#39;M BETTING ON ZIM!,2023-02-17T17:29:28Z

$ZIM reminder that JP has been the one that got the best estimates for this stock over the last couple of years. At some point others had target at $30 and the stock was $65 lol,2023-02-17T16:43:57Z
$ZIM JP Morgan $30 - Barclays $15 --- Priceless, wtf do analysts  no....no one knows how high it will run around earnings/divy date with forward guidance and right after running up to divy pay day ---then how much will it fall after. It&#39;s possible it runs to 30 and comes back to 20 after divy pay day. But again Idk about you, these forecasts are as good as the chimp throwing darts at the dart board ---if you remember those results ---well.....,2023-02-17T16:42:57Z
