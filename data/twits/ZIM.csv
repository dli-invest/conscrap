$ZIM If there is nothing else to do today then why not compare ZIM stock graph to cannabis stocks. The graphs are worrisomely similar.,2023-01-02T15:47:12Z
$ZIM Iâ€™ve just come across this company on the dividend,2023-01-02T15:40:15Z
$ZIM For reference you can compare Maersk graph. Value to pre-covid times is still about twice as much i.e. Maersk will probably lose 50% of stock value when things go to normal.

With this comparison we can estimate that ZIM also will go down at least 50%.

By the way. Definition of value trap is when a companys environment changed permanently to worse and stock starts to fall. In that time dividend percent and P/E is compared to time BEFORE environment change and that way dividend % and P/E are unbelievably good.,2023-01-02T15:37:27Z

$ZIM I just read an opinion piece saying the FED overshot interest rate hikes and unless they drop rates by at least 2% and start cranking out more dollars soon, bitcoin will go to $5000 and tech stocks will drop 50% (he didn&#39;t say all stocks by 50% just certian ones)  
 
Sounds about right.  
 
2022 was the great monetary bamboozle.  
 
They can&#39;t raise rates like they did it was too much. They tried to act all tough and it&#39;s blowing up in their face. Raising 1% or 2%  and take it easy with the money printing for a while  was all they had to do.  
 
Pension funds need annual returns of 12% to ever hope of remaining solvent. Do you think the Fed is going to let pension funds go insolvent?  
 
If the answer is yes, then who cares about your investments. We will all be growing vegetables in our lawns and hiding under blankets all winter if they don&#39;t reverse soon.,2023-01-02T06:02:22Z
My alerts for LARGE caps. I have timestamps + buy fills for everything What&#39;s my win rate?

I ONLY buy when Algos are tired of selling. How? I buy when &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; is low.

It&#39;s a simple strategy. Learn what &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; by Algos.

I don&#39;t make 100s of trades. I only buy when I get a confirmation. Ask me for the receipts. 

Next, I&#39;ll trade $ATVI + $CRWD + $SNOW + $ZIM + $NVAX,2023-01-01T23:57:46Z
