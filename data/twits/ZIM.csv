Hope is NOT strategy.
Small loss is better than bigger loss.
Don&#39;t get pumped by call holders. 
Cut your loss, buy at lower entry.,2022-04-13T04:04:42Z
$ZIM i would wish they issue a share buyback at this price. its so cheap compare to their PE. a 1B buyback will be good enough.,2022-04-13T03:45:17Z
$ZIM 
33.75% per year √∑ 4 qrts 
plus 50% gross bonus payout at the years end.

Is this correct?
Can anyone (provide) facts to the dividend payout.

Looking for clarification here.
Thanks.,2022-04-13T02:59:11Z
$ZIM Container freight rate is a function of supply and demand.   
SUPPLY = available containers and ships to move them.   
DEMAND = goods to stuff into the containers. 
 
SUPPLY got choked by bottlenecks at the ports.  DEMAND stayed steady so rates increased. 
 
Choke is loosening --&gt; increased SUPPLY.  DEMAND plateaud at high levels so rates decreased, but not to lows. 
 
China lockdown --&gt; less goods produced (drop in DEMAND) --&gt; increase in SUPPLY (less containers needed) --&gt; rates decrease.,2022-04-13T01:16:37Z
$ZIM dividend craziness notwithstanding, how is this damn thing falling every day at a 1.5 pe and market cap less than revenue. Seriously, wtf?,2022-04-13T01:15:24Z
$ZIM ZIM&#39;s primary port of destination (Los Angeles) just posted it&#39;s all time high record numbers for Q1 2022.  What do you think this tells you about ZIM&#39;s Q1 2022 results - to be released in mid May?

$ZIM What about the Divident is going to be paid avgr 20% - 30%??,2022-04-12T22:48:02Z
$ZIM Honestly, at this point, why doesn&#39;t the company just buy all of its&#39; stock back?  Or, why doesn&#39;t the management team do a leveraged buyout?  Or, why don&#39;t they use the cash on their balance sheet and buy $DAC or $TRTN or $TGH? 
 
This stock is so undervalued!  This is getting ridiculous.,2022-04-12T22:00:31Z

$ZIM  I am new to trading dividend stocks however zim helped me understand how stocks tend to fall right after dividend ex dates.  
 
But zim paid a total of $19 per share dividend then has proceeded to fall by $30 share.  
 
I set a buy limit at $55 and the stock just barely went below it. Proud owner of a few more shares.,2022-04-12T18:57:02Z
