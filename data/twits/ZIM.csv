$ZIM Yet another article on ZIM. Let&#39;s face it, we all like to read them while waiting to see how large the next dividend will be.

$ZIM Bruh what even is this. Why is there so much interest in this company?,2022-09-30T04:37:20Z
$ZIM The bears here don&#39;t really have a case other than the fact that the trend is down. Sure the trend is down, and will probably continue, but this has clearly run ahead of the trend in a bad way. With the q3 and q4 dividends deducted, we&#39;re probably around $10 a share right now. When you consider the cash on hand, with more to come this year, do you really think this is only worth $10 a share? How many years could they have negative returns for before their book value is $10 per share? Probably a decade. It sucks if you&#39;ve been here since $90, but the new pumpers here don&#39;t need to pump, the shorting has been overdone and if you can&#39;t see that then you have no idea what you&#39;re talking about.,2022-09-30T03:22:35Z

$ZIM its short term effects in play atm.  If you&#39;re thinking long term, dollar cost average on this and any potential future dips.  If you&#39;re short term, you have to be open to the price moves that technicals are showing.  PROBABLY not gonma get there, but market can be irrational.  Key levels to the downside I have if the market continues to be irrational are 22.59, 20.42 and 18.78.,2022-09-29T21:57:15Z
$ZIM  Earnings from now thru the end of next year are expected to be $27.83/sh. Also consider that container prices on ZIM major trades routes were up again so that&#39;s 2 weeks in a row up including North America East coast to China/East Asia and North America East coast to North Europe each up 8% last week by another 8% last week. I&#39;m grateful that ZIM management has our fleet in the right places.,2022-09-29T21:31:09Z
