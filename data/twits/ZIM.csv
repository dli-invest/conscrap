$ZIM Been bearish a year and a half or so. However, market is pricing the residual value of this company at basically 0. I&#39;m changing teams to bullish. This company doesn&#39;t have no value. The bear market will be long and rough, but eventually this company will likely make money again. Not buying any yet because I think there are better plays, but if I stop seeing an article every other day on this on seeking alpha I&#39;ll buy some:,2022-12-13T04:28:09Z

$ZIM Over 3 months until the next dividend,2022-12-12T20:50:22Z
$ZIM if the company did not care about the shareholders, you would not pay out 160% of the dividend. The good of shareholders over profit for yourself. Now there is some panic and manipulation. I&#39;m waiting until the next ex-date to fill up more. I think it&#39;s going to go down a bit more,2022-12-12T20:46:03Z
$ZIM the container shipping rates are sinking and that&#39;s why this stock is being shorted.

$ZIM rams bought shares of ZIM where articles on the Internet were very positive. Now they&#39;ve started writing negative things about  that means a ditch is coming,2022-12-12T20:39:51Z
$ZIM many articles are manipulations. If anyone wants the stock to go down. they write negative things about the company. I once lost money because I listened to a post on the internet talking very positively about a certain stock. People are a herd of sheep on which the big players make money. declines are fuel for increases, I&#39;m waiting for the rams to sell out. In my opinion, low volatility will mean selling out the rams.,2022-12-12T20:29:40Z

My alerts for LARGE caps. I have timestamps + buy fills for everything What&#39;s my win rate?

I ONLY buy when Algos are tired of selling. How? I buy when &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; is low.

It&#39;s a simple strategy. Learn what &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; by Algos.

I don&#39;t make 100s of trades. I only buy when I get a confirmation. Ask me for the receipts. 

Next, I&#39;ll trade $ATVI + $CRWD + $SNOW + $ZIM,2022-12-12T19:38:55Z
