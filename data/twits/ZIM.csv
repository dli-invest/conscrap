$ZIM If I bought in Monday, could I collect the May dividend?  how soon do you have to buy in?,2023-04-29T00:00:24Z
$ZIM Do you guys feel these fantastic dividends will continue?  Or will it decline somewhat in the next quarters?,2023-04-28T23:34:29Z
$ZIM On April 28, 2023 - Standard Life Aberdeen plc filed a 13F-HR form disclosing ownership of 429,100 shares of Zim Integrated Shipping Services Ltd (US:ZIM) valued at $10,118,178 USD,2023-04-28T22:46:59Z
$ZIM how can they continue to pay a $6 div at 17?,2023-04-28T22:40:16Z
$ZIM Even if dividends drop one has to be stupid selling this stock at this price although I think ALGO is the one selling it in the last few days.

$ZIM Closing above 17 was an important step as far as putting a stop in a down trending. The question is if the stock will continue to climb next week or not. Considering the stock is trading close to the 52 week low and the Fed meeting on Tuesday I would say the risk/reward for the shorts are not good at this price level.,2023-04-28T21:02:05Z
$ZIM GREEN CANDLE CONFIRMED,2023-04-28T19:47:34Z
My alerts for LARGE caps. I have timestamps + buy fills for everything What&#39;s my win rate?

I ONLY buy when Algos are tired of selling. How? I buy when &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; is low.
I don&#39;t make 100s of trades. I only buy when I get a confirmation. Ask me for the receipts. 

Next, I&#39;ll trade $ATVI + $CRWD + $SNOW + $ZIM + $NVAX,2023-04-28T19:36:40Z

$ZIM - why do you think Schwab has this perception that ZIM will not be paying dividends either for the rest of this calendar year or in the next 12 months?,2023-04-28T18:33:57Z
$ZIM any idea what the next div might be?,2023-04-28T18:05:08Z
$ZIM bought for a swing, 17.04,2023-04-28T18:01:52Z
$ZIM watching the printing and I can say it has been at least 2x as much buying at the ask than in the bid. MMs are buying back in an orderly fashion to avoid fast price spike.,2023-04-28T17:59:35Z

Well damn, looks like I may have to wait until next div cycle to spend the div cash üòè,2023-04-28T17:52:05Z
$ZIM For FY 2022: 
ZIM Net income b. tax $6.02bn 
NVIDIA Net inc. b.tax   $4.2bn 
 
ZIM market cap         $2bn 
NVIDIA market cap   $680bn 
 
AMAZON, which has a market cap of $1,090 bn actually made a net loss in 2022. 
Zim net income will fall in 2023 but will still be sufficient  to support a $4 dividend per share. 
Zim is significantly undervalued thanks to short sale manipulation. While it is disappointing to see the SP supressed by short sellers, retail investors who can hold long term can now buy a quality stock at bargain basement prices,2023-04-28T17:37:27Z
