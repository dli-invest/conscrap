$LPI I sold puts and will buy calls. Santa gave me a discount on this one. Such a great buy.  
 
Another one is $ZIM. More cash than market cap. Inventory will get replenished at some point and shipping rates will rebound. I do hope that we get a bit longer recession so that I can accumulate on the cheap and 5x invested.,2022-12-10T05:15:34Z

$ZIM Global shipping rates are what matter most to us and are very difficult to predict.  What I can predict with certainty, is that lower shipping rates are the cure to low rates because shipping companies will go out of business, lowering supply, and ultimately leading to greater profitability for those that survive.,2022-12-09T22:24:22Z

$ZIM Here&#39;s the response I received from ZIM regarding buyback:   
Thank you for your email and for being a ZIM shareholder. ZIM management is committed to creating enduring shareholder value and a critical component of this is returning capital to shareholders. We have indicated in the past that until today, we opted to promote return of capital to shareholders with dividends, in accordance with the dividend policy and have taken steps to improve our policy to reward long term shareholders since going public in early 2021. Management and the board have considered and will continue to evaluate what is the best avenue to returning capital to shareholders, and as stated, until today opted for dividends. We will continue to work closely with our Board to ensure all options are thoroughly explored for the benefit of shareholders, including a buyback program. 
 
 
Regards,

$ZIM Trading has been very tight around the 18.6 level these last two days. Have the shorts lost their nerve? In the end I had to bite at that price. Other things to do.,2022-12-09T20:21:38Z

My alerts for LARGE caps. I have timestamps + buy fills for everything What&#39;s my win rate?

I ONLY buy when Algos are tired of selling. How? I buy when &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; is low.

It&#39;s a simple strategy. Learn what &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; by Algos.

I don&#39;t make 100s of trades. I only buy when I get a confirmation. Ask me for the receipts. 

Next, I&#39;ll trade $ATVI + $CRWD + $SNOW + $ZIM,2022-12-09T19:18:52Z

$ZIM Again, again, again. 
I&#39;m here 1-2 times per Quarter. 
It is a DIVIDEND company, close your eyes and open in 5 years. 
You want to play? Play with TSLA AAPL, etc. 
Why you want buyback? Because you see your own red portfolio? 
Close your eyes again for 5 years. 
You still want to play here from bullish side, and complain?  
Close your portfolio and forget about market.,2022-12-09T18:19:58Z

$ZIM worst performing shipping stock in the whole market with the highest paid CEO in the industry.  It‚Äôs quite the remarkable conundrum that Eli has created.  We‚Äôre all waiting for you to buy you smuck.  Management needs to look in the mirror and take responsibility for the share price.  Stocks that make literally a quarter of what ZIM makes have performed 20‚Äì50 percent better.,2022-12-09T16:32:22Z
$ZIM so far no dividend.  Maybe its because i live in sweden.  I hope next week.,2022-12-09T15:52:54Z

$ZIM think about management and this year.  They‚Äôve received close to 28 dollars a share and own own 30 percent of company.  They‚Äôve received 900 million dollars in dividends  this year.  You no how many share they bought this year?  Zero.   These guys wonder why shareholders are pissed at them?,2022-12-09T14:54:32Z
$ZIM management is the most disappointing part of ZIM if we could turn these dirt bags into buyers instead of sellers would be nice.  Management just received 100 million from the dividend and I still see zero purchases of the shares.,2022-12-09T14:46:54Z
