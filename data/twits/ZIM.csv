$ZIM assuming dividends continue to stay relatively the same or even diminish as time goes on why wouldnâ€™t you try to amass like 5k shares and just pocket 10k/Qâ€¦?

Even if the stock price goes downâ€¦ the drip is dumb strong and will compound into millions over ~10years

Whatâ€™s the long term bear caseâ€¦? I just donâ€™t see it,2022-12-31T02:41:07Z
$ZIM If I was a permabull I would put GTC buy others at these levels before earning.,2022-12-31T01:52:55Z
$ZIM 100.4% not âœ…!! Plus hedge funds top 3 holders 35.2%?? 135.2% of outstanding!!! Fu shorty pay me $275!!!! 

Hedge funds Court Investments Limited is currently the company&#39;s largest shareholder with 26% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.0% and 3.2%, of the shares outstanding,,2022-12-31T00:54:12Z
$ZIM 38% okâ€¦ plus 61% = 99% ok.. 

institutions with 38% ownership. 

Then add in insiders ceo 1.4% ownership!! Numbers not okâ€¦ FU shorty pay me!!!,2022-12-31T00:45:45Z
$ZIM 29% âœ… ok.. plus 32% = 61% ok.. 

General Public Ownership

The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 29% stake in ZIM Integrated Shipping Services. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies,2022-12-31T00:41:49Z
$ZIM 26% âœ… ok.. plus 6% = 32%â€¦ 

Private Company Ownership

We can see that Private Companies own 26%, of the shares on issue. It&#39;s hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.,2022-12-31T00:40:42Z
$ZIM 6% âœ… ok

Public Company Ownership

Public companies currently own 6.0% of ZIM Integrated Shipping Services stock. We can&#39;t be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.,2022-12-31T00:39:52Z

$GOGL $ZIM Can any U.S. investor who owns these two stocks tell me if you are getting the full dividend or if the foreign government is withholding taxes on the dividends? I saw one poster say that that the Israeli government withholds 25% of the $ZIM dividend. I think $GOGL is a Norwegian company but registered in Bermuda so if it is considered a UK company, there should be no withholding for that one. I have some BP stock and there is no dividend tax withholding on it. Just want to confirm the tax treatment.,2022-12-31T00:09:35Z
