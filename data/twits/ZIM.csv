$ZIM yesterday I posted if this open at 50% of yesterdays candle, and starts trading over the high of the day (which was 27.73) it has a chance to go higher. It did open around 50% of that candle but failed at the high of the day, so it isn&#39;t going higher right now. Have a great weekend,2022-10-14T16:14:31Z
