$ZIM 75 days until the next dividend payment...,2022-10-02T04:43:54Z
@UncleFree  $ZIM someone please explain to me why this is trading like they are having a going out of business sale. It appears to be very oversold with 7 consecutive weekly red candles with the last 5 sliding down a steep lower BB. Earnings and dividends have been solid. Is it coming to an end?,2022-10-02T04:32:06Z

$ZIM Can someone smart explain to me how their dividend is paid? I assume it is based on earnings, and it seems to fluctuate markedly, and include special dividends. I assume they can&#39;t sustain their high yield, but I&#39;m curious how far this will likely decline and whether folks think their dividend is safe. Any info will be helpful as I do my D on this one. I see further downside rick but with a strong dividend, I&#39;ll take this as a good long term play.,2022-10-01T18:16:58Z

Have you sold growth stocks and need to reinvest the funds into today&#39;s current high dividend value performers?

Israeli based Zim Shipping with 100% shipping dividends;

Bermuda based Golden Ocean with 32% shipping  dividends;

Texas based Pioneer Natural Resources with 9.74% energy dividends;

Houston, Texas VOC Oil Trust with 17% energy dividends;

Australian based AGL Energy&#39;s offers 10% utility dividends.

Italian based Intesa Sanpaulo&#39;s 18% bank dividends, which may be subject to change and may decrease or increase 6%.

This is an amazing strategy adds comfort during hostile market correction. Wait at least one month before buying growth and tech stocks.,2022-09-30T23:34:52Z

$ZIM when gas price high -&gt; shipping rates high , they said &quot; Gas high = less profit&quot; and short it , and when then gas price drop -&gt; shipping rates drop , they said  &quot; shipping rates drop = less profit&quot; and short it😂 I don&#39;t care what they said , atleast , it helped me adding at discount price and collecting dividend 🤤,2022-09-30T22:09:10Z
