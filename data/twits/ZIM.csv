   PS the company he works for brings in about 90 40 foot containers a  month and he remarked if that&#39;s our price what are the little guy that bring in 3 or 4 a month going to pay.,2022-04-15T04:26:53Z
$ZIM I found proof. The Bulls were herded. I hate it when that happens, 😰,2022-04-15T02:08:08Z
$ZIM Ran a bunch of ratio charts pitting companies from hot sectors like O&amp;G and uranium vs ZIM. The result is that ZIM has bottomed, now turning up, and is set to outperform them all (barring any major development). Backed the truck up today.,2022-04-15T01:38:11Z

&quot;Back in $ZIM. 🙌 
 
Took a break for a month bc high sentiment + technical overbot into a mega dividend. Figured a big dip was coming…

$ZIM got in today at 55 , 50% position,2022-04-14T18:49:01Z
$ZIM pegging it to $55 due to options I reckon.,2022-04-14T18:36:20Z
$ZIM I’m adding more….F-it. Negative 40% drop in 20 trading days? I get it: China is closed, $17 attracted the pump and dump crowd, there is a War, blah, blah, blah. Rush in when others rush out- this is a bargain. I wish I could do a poll: After April will ZIM ever see $55 again?,2022-04-14T18:15:43Z
$ZIM jumped in at 54.86,2022-04-14T17:48:49Z
$ZIM,2022-04-14T17:45:09Z
$ZIM the way I see it it’s fair value in this point of time 55 + the 17 dollar dividend puts it at the 70ish range which is zim fair value this stock is a cash cow but for the short term future she’ll stay this way,2022-04-14T17:27:42Z
