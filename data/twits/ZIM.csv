$EMED The opioid crisis is a huge problem worldwide. Many people use opioids to manage their pain, but they get addicted, causing grave problems. Emed is here to change that. With their Wellness Pro and their Pod, you can manage your pain without taking drugs. Their 510k has been submitted to the fda, now we are just waiting on fda clearance. Once that hits, we are golden. Emed will have a huge market for their devices and imo will revolutionize the pain management industry. This truly is a sleeping, undiscovered gem‚Ä¶,2022-11-20T01:38:02Z

$ZIM If you were a mutual fund, and were going to purchase 100,000 to 1,000,000 shares, would you do this on November 21, 22, 23, or 25?,2022-11-19T19:04:38Z
$ZIM AnalysisFirst part: 
  I bought and holding onto it especially now what nobody is talking about is where Europe will get its resources if Russia keeps them off line the pipeline damaged in the North Sea is compounding this issue and Zim just bought or built LNG cargo ships Europe is about to go into winter and they won‚Äôt allow their population to freeze to death with the depths of winter still to come so we could see good numbers going into the first 2 quarters then things get dicey
