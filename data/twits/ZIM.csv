$ZIM What you need to know when looking at ZIM&#39;s balance sheet is that most of its liabilities are lease obligations ($4.4bil). So ZIM has around $240 mil in total debt, which means market is valuing ZIM less than net cash.,2022-11-29T04:08:10Z

$ZIM Well, I would like to know what is going on, so I wrote this letter to the company at investors @ zim.com 
 
Hi Zim Integrated Shipping Services Investor Relations, 
 
I hope you are well. I own xx,xxx shares of ZIM stock, and I am wondering what your plans are to increase the value of the stock. As you can tell, that is quite a bit of money for a single investor, and I have a lot riding on your company. Obviously, I like your company and respect it. 
 
Of course, we recently went through the November 2022 ex-dividend date, etc., during which we found out we would receive a $2.95 - 25% dividend, or $2.21 per share. But the stock itself dropped $4.47 per share, which was deleterious, so I don&#39;t have my dreams pinned on high dividends. 
 
What are you planning to do to raise the stock price? 
 
Wishing you happiness, 
Tim,2022-11-29T02:49:55Z

$ZIM TNP has a 11 PE and pays a measly 1% dividend compared to ZIM .5 PE and obviously huge dividend, relatively in same industry. And TNP share price is $17 - now that&#39;s the joke of the day. Yes forward looking profits and dividends for 2023/24 will be less however still way ahead of so many other stocks. The question no one can answer is just what will ZIMs profits be in 2023/24 and what divy will come from that. Even a  $4 annual dividend for a couple years would beat the majority of stocks on ROI at this SP and beat inflation. With an $8 or more divy coming in Q4 I can&#39;t find a better mid to long term play.,2022-11-29T00:19:58Z
