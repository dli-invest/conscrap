$ZIM recession fears are  overblown and premature, especially early cycle interest rate rises. Rates will be increasing back to what they were, not the life support as a response to Covid. The US economy is at full employment, consumers are still spending, the economy is growing when a recession requires two quarters of negative growth. Stocks aren‚Äôt the economy, and lofty tech valuations will be adjusted and cost of debt will increase. But Zim has no debt, making  money and a ridiculously low p/e. In the end, earnings will win the day. What we are seeing is not a sell off because the Fed is raising rates- it‚Äôs the fear about the Fed raising rates which is not the same thing. The market hates uncertainty. Expect a market rally AFTER the rate rise. The clearer the Fed is, the more stable the market. Wall Street will go back to making money. This is just a tantrum folks and is overblown. Bearish sentiment is fantastically high which is a great contrary indicator.,2022-04-24T02:57:57Z

One in five container ships is now stuck at ports worldwide, with 30% of the backlog coming from China. And Lars Jensen, the CEO of the shipping container industry consulting firm Vespucci Maritime, told Fortune that the full impact of China‚Äôs policies will only begin to reveal itself over the coming weeks. 
 
‚ÄúUntil now most vessels have still been calling Shanghai almost as per normal‚Äîthis means cargo to Shanghai does not end up in the wrong place,‚Äù Jensen said. ‚ÄúBut this is likely to change in the coming weeks if the lockdown is not removed. Then you will see more omissions of Shanghai as a port and canceled sailings, and the [supply chain] impact will increase.‚Äù 
 
Even if strict lockdowns in Shanghai are lifted, U.S. ports will likely be slammed with a wave of pent-up cargo from newly reopened factories in China. That will lead to higher freight rates, Jensen says, and worsen congestion at ports worldwide.

Once the lockdown eases, factories will make up for the lost production, further increasing demand and catapulting prices even higher.

There are only three companies listed in the US with a PE &lt;1.6 and a div &gt; 5%. Two of them are under US sanctions with no trading volumes, the 3rd one is $ZIM (P/E 1.52) 
As a comparison, the shipping industry is currently trading at a PE ratio of 4.4x which is lower than its 3-year average PE of 12.1x. 
The market is pricing that this industry will crash and that ZIM will have hard time making it through,2022-04-23T07:08:29Z
