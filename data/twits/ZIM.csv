$ZIM &quot;Spot rates still nowhere near past levels&quot; 
 
&quot;If the same pace of decline continued for the next three months, the index would still be double pre-COVID levels&quot; 
 
&quot;Contract rates support carrier profits&quot; 
 
&quot;a decline in spot rates does not have the same effect on ocean carriers as it did pre-pandemic because of changes in the contract market. Carriers have more of their volume on annual contracts&quot; 
 
&quot;Contract rates are also dramatically higher than they used to be. While a portion of this yearâ€™s contract business will be renegotiated, or not honored, the remainder will allow carriers to offset spot-business declines.&quot; 
 
&quot;Ocean carrier Zim (NYSE: ZIM) said its contract rates this year were double 2021â€™s.&quot; 
 
&quot;Thus, not only do spot rates still have a long way to fall before theyâ€™re back where they started â€” even at the steeper-than-expected pace of decline â€” theyâ€™re also overshadowed by contract rates when it comes to near-term carrier profits and shipper costs.&quot;

$ZIM - great company but projections for 2023 are cut by 30% so this drop is expected plus divvys will not be as generous as 2022.   Nothing wrong with ZIM, great company, but its sales are cyclical.   Right now it makes for a great swing trade until sale projections increase.   Peace,2022-09-19T21:56:28Z
$ZIM those who were bullish on this for the past weeks Iâ€™m sorry that you got in too early. Just today Zim entered into demand zone. This shouldâ€™ve been first day to start buying with institutions. 1st target $46. 2nd $80,2022-09-19T21:39:30Z
