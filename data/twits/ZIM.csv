$ZIM isee it holding up after the exdiv date certainly will recover but wont drop 6points look at 8/12/2021 when it was trading at this level it powered thru that div and eventually leveled at $78 , with the dry good index elevating by 230% since feb it is gonna be another div bonanza!! in june im turning all div&#39;s to stock evade the tax hit...im up 118% in holding pattern for this fiscal year w ZIM.. they are really well positioned to keep the div train rolling!! cheaper fuel 50% backlog on deliveries and the shipping rates on a nosebleed,2023-03-17T23:42:19Z

$ZIM Fun fact, on the same date of the Q4 earnings report &amp; dividend announcement, March 13th, 2023, was the largest, fastest, and probably the most powerful coronal mass ejection. Thankfully it went in the opposite direction of the Earth. We got super super lucky.,2023-03-17T22:11:28Z
$ZIM Forgive my ignorance. 
 
1. How many short shares are still out there? 
2. What interest rate are they paying? 
3. How many have to cover by March 20, 21, or 22? 
 
I am hoping for a short squeeze. 
 
God bless you,

$ZIM $TNT.UN.CA For the canadian investors 16-17% dividend. This one is a small REIT that mostly has government entities as tenants. No idea why it dropped so low suddenly. Personally not invested in it right now,2023-03-17T20:27:58Z
My alerts for LARGE caps. I have timestamps + buy fills for everything What&#39;s my win rate?

I ONLY buy when Algos are tired of selling. How? I buy when &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; is low.
I don&#39;t make 100s of trades. I only buy when I get a confirmation. Ask me for the receipts. 

Next, I&#39;ll trade $ATVI + $CRWD + $SNOW + $ZIM + $NVAX,2023-03-17T20:27:13Z

Of the top 10 largest shipping companies in the world ranked by total TEU, of which ZIM is the 10th largest, 8 are publicly traded.  
 
Of the 8 publicly traded companies, only one other is down today, though less than ZIM.  
 
Take a look.  
 
1. MSC 
2. Maersk: +1.33%/+1.68% 
3. CMA 
4. COSCO: +3.48%/+2.31% 
5. Hapag: +2.17%/+2.72% 
6. Evergreen: +1.57% 
7. Nippon Yusen: -0.12%/-1.76% 
8. HMM: +0.49% 
9. Yang Ming: +1.08% 
10. Zim: -2.24% 
 
But yes, when you compare it to other second or third tier shipping companies, then ZIM had a good day.,2023-03-17T20:22:07Z
