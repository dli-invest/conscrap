$ZIM last chart before I head out. 
 
I&#39;ve been bullish this name for a while and have been sharing charts for a while now. 
- Now that the whopper $17/sh  divvy is out, the stocks dropped close to it&#39;s 50DMA 
- However, thats not the first time it&#39;s happened - we&#39;ve seen 19-20% drops, and a series of higher highs and higher lows. 
- While there are a few mixed signals...holding the 50DMA is key now. You want to avoid behavior change and see a breakdown. 
- I also added the SMA pro &quot;crystal ball&quot; indicator to the left - trend is low confidence for now but worth monitoring. 
 
Still long for now, but on close watch.  
 
I share more analysis like this with the #SMAPRO team

$ZIM stopped right at the 50MA. Very oversold, looking for a bounce. Also this chart on Stockcharts doesn‚Äôt look right. Shows a high of 80 only but this stock hit 90 and gapped down but that‚Äôs not showing here. Anybody know why?,2022-04-06T03:54:58Z

$ZIM heavy volume could mean KEN is selling some of their shares or more likely some institutions were picking up shares plus many investors were using their dividend payout for more shares. Plus transports were all pretty much down today.. Go buy TWTR if you can&#39;t handle some selling. Shorts will try to scare you out of your shares if you let them. I added another 100 shares at $62. üòÉ Holding 500 now at $65 average.,2022-04-06T01:14:19Z
$ZIM received a packet in the mail to vote but no dividend.. OK?,2022-04-06T01:07:38Z
$ZIM Is there a website that gives you the Altman Z score of ZIM (and other securities, for that matter)? What about intrinsic value? I don&#39;t want to compute them myself, but I can&#39;t find a website that just has them.,2022-04-06T00:17:42Z
$ZIM don‚Äôt want to be a negative Nancy but volume was double the average with over 8 million shares changing hands. That‚Äôs not a great sign on a down day. Could even suggest an institutional investor is reducing or ditching their stake.I‚Äôm not worried, a bit of noise and nervousness is good for a stock. I normally play contrarian and I broke my cardinal rule on super bullish sentiment ‚Äúthis time will be different‚Äù. Lol. So some uncertainty, fear and analysts questioning the run actually makes me feel better about the stock. Full capitulation, when the last bull challenges his sanity, is the best bullish single for recovery. We aren‚Äôt there yet or maybe ‚Äúthis time will be different‚Äù and our Zim holders are savvier than most and know the game. Will see.,2022-04-06T00:04:47Z
$ZIM falling knife‚Ä¶ got cut twice. the play here was to sell before dividends. No telling where this thing will end up. GL,2022-04-05T23:31:58Z
$ZIM anyone receive a large packet of mail from ZIM regarding stakeholder voting?,2022-04-05T23:18:56Z

$ZIM The problem with dollar cost averaging down is if you own 1400 shares and you dollar cost average is $75 if you buy 100 shares at these prices it really doesn&#39;t drop your cost basis by much... If I ever break even I&#39;m out...This MF is way to volatile for me and my cost basis!!!,2022-04-05T22:52:12Z
$ZIM Pull back yesterday due to mis-read legislation fears. And today because everything pulled back. Check out this Reddit post on why the legislation will HELP Zim. This is a catalyst, actually...but bad for other shipping stocks that are not already in compliance. https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/twmru0/buy_signal_why_shipping_stocks_declined_5_8_today/,2022-04-05T22:39:05Z

Fear is causing this beatdown, yet the market facts tell such a different story.  
 
The below is just one sector. Great buys down here:

MEAT processors are battling another round of spiralling sea freight shipment rates for chilled and frozen containers leaving Australia this year, further undermining margins. 
 
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìFreight rates on container export are going through the roof in the past few weeks,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù an exasperated export processor told Beef Central this morning. 
 
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìCosts are up an average of around 60 percent across the board since last year, but into some markets, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s as much as 100 percent or more,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù he said. 
 
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe lockdown in Shanghai caused by COVID is the latest issue causing huge problems. We can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get meat in, or containers out,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù one company spokesman said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd when it does get released after lengthy delays, our chilled meat is pushing up towards its 120-day shelf life limit. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a nightmare.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
