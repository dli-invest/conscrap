$ZIM Great opportunities to load here. Haven&#39;t still received the dividend, anyone in the same situation?,2022-04-07T05:28:44Z
$ZIM gonna average down at 56. ü§´,2022-04-07T04:58:25Z
$ZIM If you&#39;re a contrarian, $ZIM is probably not the right play for you.  It&#39;s a $7 Billion market cap company trading at 1X cash and 1.5X P/E and growing at 300%.   It&#39;s not time to dip your toe in... dive in while the share price is outrageously cheap and load up at a ow basis while you can! 
 
The pullback that we&#39;re experiencing is industry wide and will reverse quickly.  This is an investment grade security that was made into a swing trade because of an overblown dividend.  This baby ran too hot, that&#39;s all.  Nothing else to doubt here. 
 
To be clear, 30% the shares outstanding and 60% of the float has traded in the LAST THREE TRADING DAYS.  $60 is the new base to build on and the light hands with previously cheap shares worthy of profit taking have moved on.,2022-04-07T04:24:36Z
$ZIM stocks climb a wall of worry. To reach new highs we need more bearish sentiment, retailer capitulation, more analysts downgrades and the street to be talking about oil/gold/crypto/tech or whatever as the next new thing. For shipping to be forgotten about. Then the selling exhausts itself with just the faithful bag holders left and then it can slowly grind higher, a bit here and there, 2 Green Day‚Äôs to every red and then some smart money will notice the income generating and ROI/ROE and start quiet positions. Then more main stream banks and institutions. Then the movement begins to accelerate and analysts start upgrading and finally retail mum n dads jump in. This is the end phase at the peak. The longer we stay below the radar as an unloved stock, the higher the final price will be. If bullish sentiment kicks on too early, it will limit the rise or any rally begin to fizzle. 

Be contrarian and Zim is the best place to be contrarian just now.,2022-04-07T03:33:27Z

$CLF Quite a few of us sold too early, with regret. Where have you parked your money since? The bulk of mine has gone into $ZIM  and $GSL the last couple of days, plus a few smaller positions elsewhere last week. I&#39;ll be back in CLF eventually.,2022-04-07T00:42:22Z

$ZIM I‚Äôm sure Mintzmyer shorts as soon as he sells. The Reddit crowd will figure that out very soon. They‚Äôll take him to the cleaners and his followers,2022-04-06T22:03:19Z
$ZIM and $XELA  billions dollars company in oversold area ‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs accumulate !,2022-04-06T21:50:46Z
$ZIM is a complete anomaly 
‚Ä¢  $7B Market Cap is less than cash and current receivables 
‚Ä¢  1.5 P/E, yet growing at 300% year over year 
‚Ä¢  Has a healthy 28% annual dividend (and probably higher in 2022) 
‚Ä¢  Will likely generate $40/per share of cash this year, and trades at $59/Share 
 
Current RSI of 25 - VERY OVERSOLD.   
 
Buying now at these prices and holding for 1 year could be a life changing trade for anyone.,2022-04-06T21:41:11Z

$ZIM Finally, J Mintzmyer is back on the &quot;Buy $ZIM&quot; boat and also putting to rest the rumors that freight rates for containers are going down.  They&#39;re actually increasing during a seasonally down period!

$ZIM This thing keeps going down. It will be down another 10% tomorrow.,2022-04-06T21:03:43Z
$ZIM One of the more credible theories I&#39;ve heard to explain this week&#39;s slaughtering.  $DAC $KEN sold off big stakes (they are the biggest ZIM shareholders recall), so as to take some profits off the table, and perhaps incent a steep sell-off, which is exactly what&#39;s happened.  These same players now are primed to buy back-in, at a massive discount. If/when they do that, ZIM takes off again.,2022-04-06T20:46:28Z
