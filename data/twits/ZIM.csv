$ZIM When the stock price is much greater than the net asset value per share 
I will choose to sell 
Now everyone should choose to buy,2023-03-21T04:00:05Z
$ZIM Do you think the share price drops down by $6.40 right after ex dividend date? I‚Äôm considering selling before ex- dividend or holding it? Any thoughts?
Also I was thinking of moving it to a tax shelter account to save taxes on dividend. In Canada we have TFSA. Is that wise?
Thank you,,2023-03-21T03:54:06Z
$ZIM Here&#39;s another downside to short-selling you might not have thought of yet. 
 
Q: I shorted a large amount of a dividend-paying stock and was surprised that its latest quarterly dividend was deducted from my brokerage account. Why did I have to pay it? 
 
There are several downsides to short-selling. You have unlimited loss potential, the market has an inherent positive bias over the long run, you&#39;ll probably have to pay a fee for borrowing the shares, and yes, you are responsible for paying any dividends issued by the stock while you&#39;re short. 
 
Here&#39;s why. Consider the basic mechanism of how short-selling works. 
 
When you short a stock, you&#39;re borrowing shares from someone else (typically your brokerage firm) and selling them on the open market. Your hope is that the stock&#39;s price goes down, so you can repurchase and return the borrowed shares for less than you sold them for.,2023-03-21T02:47:08Z
$ZIM  xDiv by definition is the first day the stock trades without div. (The 4th). This makes sense since the PAY date is the 3rd.

But how on earth buying before the 4th, say on the 3rd, which is the *PAY* day ( per your posted site) will get you the Div ?

Technically, you don&#39;t even own the stock  before T+2 (or 3).

So how can you buy a stock on the day that Div is getting PAID, and still get the Div ?,2023-03-21T02:37:20Z
$ZIM Just to clarify the ex-dividend date is 4/4/23.  Buying anytime before that will get you the dividend.  Check out the source: https://investors.zim.com/stock-information/default.aspx,2023-03-21T02:17:56Z

$ZIM thats laughable..LOL i&#39;m re-investing my dividend they give me stock instead,2023-03-20T23:43:57Z
$ZIM  no. Just common sense assumption that a company which values so much share holders equity,  and realized  in the form of dividends, most likely will continue to do so.

Just my .02 Shekels.,2023-03-20T23:38:45Z

@BeardPoor - I was responding to @stu204 comment. Not you.  
 
@stu204 Wrote: Something about having to contact his brokers for tax shit???? 
 
I&#39;m saying with 45,000 shares... you should probably have low level professionals doing that shit for you. 
Or shiiiiit, maybe holler at ZIM direct. Ask for a special letterhead. 
 
Just sayin&#39; 
 
I&#39;m also US resident. Don&#39;t know what your restriction levels are like in Canada. I just give my CPA my password(s) to Schwab and they do all that foreign tax credit filing shit for me. My point is - I don&#39;t even own a quarter of what @stu204 owns.  
 
Seems odd to me the &quot;WHALE&quot; is doing long division. But hey back to my original  call - there should be Team USA and Team international for $ZIM players. Also providing more depth to my &quot;keep your taxes to yourself&quot; comment from a different ZIM thread - days ago.

$ZIM anyone has clue how the future of the dividend look like ?,2023-03-20T22:25:05Z
$ZIM Shorts running out of time. $6.40 DIVIDEND they will have to pay soon unless they cover and exit their position. Doubling down on their part shows their level of incompetence. Dividend is almost 30% of the stock price right now.  Good luck, you‚Äôre gonna need it.,2023-03-20T22:04:39Z
