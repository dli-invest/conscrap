$ZIM For your consideration:  
 
So many people here are either delusional, dumb or both.  
 
Using the consensus earnings estimates, the upcoming dividend will be between $0.95-$8.05. This is the generous estimate of an eps of ~$3.00 when most have it closer to $2.25.  
 
People hoping for an upward surprise are gonna be disappointed. All revisions have been in a downward direction and Q1 2023 guidance is terrible. Really, it is so bad. 
 
Take off your 25% dividend tax haircut and you’ve got a pittance of a payment when factoring the bags most people are holding as the stock is down -74% since its 52week high.  
 
Accusing anyone who doesn’t praise this garbage stock of being “shorters” when the majority of traders on yahoo finance don’t use brokerage accounts that can short stocks and the best they can do is buy puts to profit off any further decline. Which is a dumb play as well for an equity in the proverbial toilet.,2023-02-22T22:12:34Z

2 of 2) “The early read on that is, while there has been improvement in managing inventory levels down in some cases, in other cases and other retailers, it hasn’t occurred as quickly as they’d expected,” he said. “So we’re expecting some of the slowness that we saw in that fourth quarter to continue into the first quarter and frankly into the first half.” 
 
Walmart and Home Depot both gave cautious annual guidance and warned that demand could moderate through 2023.  
Cox said Matson expects “more normal seasonality” to occur before the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. “Absent an economic hard landing in the US, we expect improved trade dynamics in the second half of 2023 as the transpacific marketplace transitions to a more normalized level of demand,” he said.,2023-02-22T20:41:56Z

China-US Trade Bellwether Sees Demand Slump Ending in Second Half

1 of 2) The rebalancing of US retail inventories is taking longer than some companies expected, prolonging a slump in global shipping that’s weighing on ocean freight rates during a period of weakened consumer demand. 
 
Those are among the takeaways from an earnings conference call late Tuesday with executives from Matson, the Honolulu-based container line. While it’s ranked as just the 28th-biggest carrier by total capacity, the company is a bellwether for trade between China and the US because it operates an expedited service between the world’s largest economies. 
 
CEO Matt Cox said Matson is closely monitoring the inventory levels of major retailers and other customers to gauge where transpacific shipping demand is headed.,2023-02-22T20:41:37Z
