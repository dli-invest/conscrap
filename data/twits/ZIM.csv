$ZIM I think down trend already broken. Breaks $20 and lots of money will load in.,2023-02-01T05:30:42Z
$ZIM I think next dividend will be between 2.00-2.50$ per share,2023-02-01T05:06:47Z
$ZIM Would it be safe making this a retirement fund? The dividend sounds way too good to sustain for the long term.,2023-02-01T05:00:25Z
$ZIM if paid quarterly the next ex Div would be end of Feb. Thought they were going to a regular schedule.,2023-02-01T03:10:44Z
$ZIM 
Started accumulating a position here today for the run up to dividend. Shorts should be buying before the March dividend announcement. Continued high dividends and profitable business should be good for ZIM in â€˜23.,2023-02-01T00:40:22Z
$ZIM what really the prediction .. I think $7 bucks max for dividend...,2023-01-31T23:36:00Z
$ZIM  
ZIM is &quot;moving sideways&quot; for now. It will remain stable and stagnant around $ 20.00 per share. 
E.R. is on March 8th. I am going to wait until around the March 1st to get in. Then we shall see what the &quot;Israeli&#39;s&quot; to do push their stock up huge. 
I have faith in them. :) 
Best to everyone. :),2023-01-31T22:04:10Z

ATTENTION:  &quot;ValueFundamentals&quot; BELOW: 
 
They ARE &quot;ISRAELI&quot;.   
Read between &quot;the lines&quot;. :) 
&quot;They&quot; do that sort of thing to make money. 
 
And this WILL go to AT LEAST $ 50.00 to  
$ 60.00 per share....because they ARE &quot;ISRAELI&quot;. God Bless &#39;Em&quot;. :) 
 
Best to everyone. :),2023-01-31T22:01:19Z
$ZIM Can someone explain what&#39;s happening here? The company reports an EPS of $49 and tangible bookvalue of $47 per share, while the price is at $18... Something seems off here,2023-01-31T21:09:11Z
$ZIM Why is this price so much lower than their 52 week high?  I don&#39;t remember seeing this as a meme stock.  Was it a run-up before dividends?,2023-01-31T19:35:23Z
$ZIM way undervalued.  Still doing over $3B in revenue each quarter which exceeds the company&#39;s market cap. Buy and hold.,2023-01-31T19:11:16Z
$ZIM good support at .92,93ish.  So good position for another try to break good into the 19s.  We will see.,2023-01-31T18:38:17Z
$ZIM rejected bad at 19.  Ouch. Looks like we will have to enjoy just a slight green day.  But any green day is good.,2023-01-31T18:17:13Z
$ZIM chart looks bullish , so one good report and this skyrockets.,2023-01-31T17:34:52Z
