$ZIM not a bad stock  
 
careful about guidance  
 
careful about expectations 
 
it will by my guess hit a number and sell off 
 
no 100% dividend 
 
dividend not quarterly ? Yearly? 
 
you could expect it was misvalued with China lockdowns at $50 not sure what else t expect,2022-05-09T02:15:19Z

Further, and note what they are chartering.

Natty and King Coal investors, climb aboard the Zim train...

ZIM stock vaulted 19% to 66.16 last week, surging to reclaim its 50-day line. That&#39;s after bottoming from 48.21 in the prior week, testing its 40-week line. The high-dividend shipping play now has a cup base with a 79.05 buy point. Ideally, ZIM stock would move a little higher, than forge a handle heading into earnings on May 18.

ZIM is an ocean-going container ship play, but it recently chartered three LNG ships as well.,2022-05-09T00:14:47Z

From Investors Business Daily

Key inflation reports are on tap this week. That could be a market catalyst either way. While a rally attempt is still technically underway on the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones, the market correction isn&#39;t showing many signs of a bottom.

Eli Lilly (LLY), Albemarle (ALB), Dollar Tree (DLTR), ZIM Integrated Shipping (ZIM) and new IPO Excelerate Energy (EE) are five stocks worth watching, either in buy zones, near buy points or simply flexing relative strength.,2022-05-09T00:09:47Z
$ZIM has beautiful growth since the IPO in 2021, even through this market. I was doing some research and read that the dividend yield is something like 100%. Low P/E, great growth and dividend. what am i missing here this screams buy during these hectic times in the market,2022-05-08T22:42:27Z
$DAC not getting the watch list üëÄ love $ZIM is getting on twittah.  FWIW, Mintzmyer put $75 PT on ZIM &amp; $120 on DAC end of April 25.

$ZIM very bullish. This is a long investment. 10 billion dollars profit. At least we can see 100$ soon,2022-05-08T09:08:57Z
$ZIM To the longer invested here, a question:
Have you figured out any tactics in this unpredictable market.
Despite good figures have been recently, many companies still beaten.
Should we continue to give Kurstechnisch so gas until 18.5 smells for me (depending on the course on 18.5) after Sell on good news.
Or one says to oneself:
P/E ratio at 1...... there is still more and or there is still something announced which boosts the price.
ARP etc.
Freight rates will probably remain high in the future with all the world political garbage.
Please for serious answers,2022-05-08T07:32:12Z

Maersk said Wednesday that freight rates will stay elevated as supply chain pressures persist. According to the company, congestion in sectors such as trucking and warehousing in mainland China, have created &quot;bottlenecks, resulting in challenged supply chain management services and elevated rates.&quot; 
 
The company&#39;s average freight rate jumped 71% in the first quarter from a year earlier.
