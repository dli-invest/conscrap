$ZIM Tomorrow’s options c/p 16.78,2022-10-13T22:46:14Z
$ZIM Boss move and volume today. Trading over the 21 (orange line). If it opens above 50% of todays candle and starts trading over the high of today, I think it heads towardds resistance. (volume can&#39;t collapse though). Have a terrific weekend,2022-10-13T22:14:28Z
$ZIM  Huge # of 20k buy prints today and a large X trade at the close. It&#39;s a very good sign! Looking forward to more of the same over the next 27 trading days going into earnings. $9.54 Q3 is great and and a beat would be even better.,2022-10-13T22:11:27Z
$ZIM Shares available to short is the lowest I&#39;ve seen.  Down from 1 million to 500k which tells me we now have approx 13 million shares short @1.2% borrowing fees.  It&#39;s a very good thing with a small float of only 80 million.  All my fellow owners could put in a GTC sell at $100/sh and that would take your shares out of the pool and squeeze the shorts a bit more.,2022-10-13T22:06:27Z
$ZIM has one of the better Altman-Z scores in its industry: 4.60 vs 2.00. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/ZIM/fundamental-analysis?key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-10-13T20:53:00Z
