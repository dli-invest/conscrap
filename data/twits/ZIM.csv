$ZIM and, they will pay down,,,2022-09-25T05:40:05Z
$ZIM Lets break some things down . Even before Covid since 2014 the Company was growing year over year and debt was going down Simple reason . They are managing their money a lot better.  Now they are growing their personal fleet .  Cost less , Debt will go down more because of the investment . Asset balance goes up . They are also expanding on the other delivery methods as well..   They have inland transport system and they have car carrier service. They are boosting their base with the freight carrier services as well .  They expand them might go negative  it happens but expansion is always good depending on how often they do it .,2022-09-25T04:46:43Z

Freight rates and demand remain higher than they were before the pandemic, but the direction of travel is obvious. Carriers will need to match capacity with demand to halt further falls,2022-09-24T22:05:28Z

$ZIM How crazy would it be if these guys actually pay out a 100% dividend though. What would that even do to the share price? .01 cent stock? lol,2022-09-24T20:51:15Z
$ZIM Hard to decide what is fair value.  Clearly the company will earn less in 2023 than they did in 2022.  A lot of the fall was shorts piling in after ex dividend date coupled with the epic crash in the past month from the indexes.    The ridiculous pop in the dollar means more favorable conditions for exporters like China and Brazil, creating more imports for the United States.  Also falling oil prices should ultimately help.,2022-09-24T19:54:48Z

$ZIM I work in the logistics world and idk where these reports of shipping rates going down is coming from. Definitely a scare tactic. We’re in peak season. Literally every steamship line has an extra peak season charge. I have direct contacts with ZIMs sales team and I have yet to do business with ZIM because of how expensive their rates are. Goes to show you that the media will spew any bullshit news after big boys dump at ATH.,2022-09-24T16:54:41Z

$ZIM I see a good chance of a reversal on the next day or two.  More bearish posts then bullish posts over the last two days.  Looks like Friday was an exhaustion day,  daily and 4 hour RSI under 19 and bpemblinton the biggest bull on the stock is now bearish,2022-09-24T15:46:51Z
$ZIM  ran ipo already back to down low,,,2022-09-24T15:06:14Z
$ZIM from Q2 report Reaffirmed 2022 Full Year Guidance: Expect to Generate Record Adjusted EBITDA1 
of $7.8-$8.2 Billion and Adjusted EBIT of $6.3-$6.7 Billion 
 
if we take the low end of guidance 7.8 billion and spread it out like this we know q1 and q2  
    
based on these numbers if we assume NI and cash flow are the same that means ZIM is generating roughly $.03 a day in cash flow per share and we have roughly 84 days since the last ER thats $2.5 a share cash plus the $32.75 they had already thats over $35 cash per share being conservative and a potential $4.5- $7.7 dividend for the next two Q&#39;s I actually hope they do share buy backs in lieu of dividends but in my book this is a no brainer even if they make no money in 2023,2022-09-24T14:07:22Z
$ZIM   I still like ZIM, but the overwhelming bearishness despite solid fundamentals simply cannot be ignored here... I&#39;d call it a battleground stock, but the bulls are getting so heavily crushed it&#39;s really a slaughter-ground stock...,2022-09-24T12:45:44Z
ZIM Integrated Shipping Services downgraded by TheStreet to d+. https://www.marketbeat.com/r/1821734 $ZIM,2022-09-24T11:07:21Z
$ZIM divy?

ZIM Integrated pays its dividend on the basis of a variable dividend policy, which limits the company&#39;s financial commitments during times of falling shipping rates and profits. By doing this, ZIM Integrated reduces its cash flow risk while offering shareholders upside in the dividend during good times when profits and freight rates are high.

However, the decline in shipping rates in September foreshadows a significant decline in net profits (and dividends) for ZIM Integrated and its shareholders. For that reason, I believe the 80% dividend yield is a backward-looking measure for investors that doesn&#39;t accurately reflect changes in the company&#39;s net income potential related to a drop in freight rates. The 80% dividend yield is therefore most likely not sustainable and a value trap for investors.,2022-09-24T11:04:49Z
$ZIM 

ZIM Integrated has very little influence over shipping rates, which are a function of the strength of the global economy. With the IMF recently down-grading its growth expectations for 2023 and inflation still being a major issue around the world, shipping rates are all but set to come further under pressure. While ZIM Integrated pays its dividend on a variable basis, a downturn in the cargo shipping industry would likely seriously impact the firm&#39;s ability to generate profits, which may result not only in lower dividend payments going forward but also in a re-rating of ZIM Integrated&#39;s shares.,2022-09-24T11:04:31Z
