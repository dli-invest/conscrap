High container freight rates likely to last well into 2023 
Congestion and supply shortages will continue to drive rates environment

ANALYSIS 
 
James Baker 
@JamesBakerCI james.baker@informa.com 
A normalisation of the box shipping freight environment continues to fade further into the future. Even with inflation slowing demand, a decline in rates is unlikely this year or next,2022-05-21T16:06:43Z
$ZIM  
 
But even if second-half spot-rate declines are extreme, contract rates should come to the rescue. In the trans-Pacific trade, annual contracts often run from May 1 to April 30. Contract rates during the first half of 2022 (signed last year) are much higher than the previous annual rates. And the new contracts that started May 1 are up sharply yet again, which should buoy average rates (including both contract and spot) in the second half of 2022.

According to the latest crowd-sourced data from Xeneta, long-term rates for reefer containers on the key US West Coast to Far East route soared almost 60% in April. 
 
The Oslo-based ocean and air freight benchmarking specialist today reveals a surge in rates of around $2000 per 40‚Äô unit after the latest 12-mo contracts came to a close. The average contracted rate recorded on 5/15 stood at $5850 per container, while the average for new agreements running from Q2 &#39;22 to the end of Q1 2023 was even higher, at $5945 per 40‚Äô reefer. 
 
‚ÄúThis is an almighty increase, pushing prices to an all-time high‚Äù comments Patrik Berglund, Xeneta CEO. ‚ÄúContracts on this trade tend to be for year-long durations, running from the start of April to the end of the following March. With the escalating cost of energy prices, and the recent strength of the market for ocean freight in general, shippers would have expected some pain at the negotiating table.

When is dividend and how much?,2022-05-20T21:25:37Z
$ZIM Next week the market is due for a correction (the good kind.)  With all the positivity around this company, fast approaching ex-div, we should be in for an excellent week.  Two weeks ago today I was extremely bullish and got burned, followed by some moments of redemption.  We&#39;re basically even over the past two weeks, which is an impressive feat.  Every time we get burned we keep coming back, amidst the firestorm of this market!  As soon as that storm subsides we are destined to seriously push up.  If fundamentals matter, and I still believe and trust they do!,2022-05-20T21:04:27Z
$ZIM what‚Äôs the EPS Ttm for this stock I can‚Äôt find any updated information since their earnings?,2022-05-20T20:58:42Z
The top 10 largest ocean carriers in 2000 commanded 51% of the market; today, a whopping 80% &amp; all are based outside the US.  
 
In effort to control (inflate) prices, mega-shippers have organized into 3 major container shipping alliances: 2M, The Alliance &amp; Ocean Alliance. Deep in the fine print of cargo shipping contracts, these alliances can cancel ‚Äî or have ‚Äúblank sailings‚Äù ‚Äî if demand has slumped. More canceled sailings mean less capacity for cargo, and likely higher rates. 
 
Further, ship sizes continue to grow - the largest ship class of a given year has increased by 50% from 2012 to today, or nearly sixfold from 1981 to today. The largest container ships to be delivered this year have a max capacity of 24,000 TEUs &amp; named &quot;Ever Alot&quot; (the same shipping company that blocked the Suez Canal&quot;. Larger ships simply squeezed out smaller ships/companies. 
 
Lastly, these mega-ships are too large for most ports leading to congestion!!

$ZIM Even if you discount all the metrics, a company that is producing this much cash is a boon during high inflation periods. I could care less about the SP... If it goes up, great, my shares are worth more PLUS I get a great divie. If it goes down, great, I can buy more shares and get even MORE divies... Win/Win,2022-05-20T18:55:27Z
