$ZIM IMO, this is why it is so important to understand suport and resistance lines. In mid November, we could determine a resistance line after a few periods which gave us a target entry of 30.00. This never hit our target and started a downtrend. Last period was one period over the 5 day EMA (green line) in which we now need a confirmation that momentum has swung upwards. We can get that if this trades over the 50 day SMA (red line) around 20.00. It still has to trade over that upper resistance but there&#39;s a 10.00 price differential to get between the 50 and resistance. Some other things have to happen but I have an alert set at 20.00. If it reachs that, then I&#39;ll look at a possible entry with a 30% upside. Have a great green week,2023-01-22T21:05:56Z

$ZIM A few comments, based on the the Q3 2022 and Q4 2021 reports. 
(1) Low bounds of guidance for 2022 EBITDA and EBIT, respectively, were 12% and 3% higher than for 2021. 
(2) Thus, earnings for 2022 will at least equal those those for 2021 ($39.02), and likely beat by a few %. 
(3) A 50% dividend for 2022, less the $10.55 already paid, amounts to at least $8.96 ($6.72 after tax). 
(4) Pay close attention to the guidance given for 2023. Last year, EBITDA guidance was $7.1-7.5 in Q1, and $7.4-7.7 in Q3. ZIM&#39;s management has high foresight.,2023-01-22T07:00:39Z

$ZIM Why ZIM&#39;s upward trending stock price will continue. Facts about ZIM. 
- Global shipping rates are stabilizing and even increasing in many of ZIM&#39;s routes. 
- Earnings, dividend and forward guidance to be announced within in 34 trading days. 
- Short interest is at all time high above 20% of float (Shares sold Short are future buying). 
- Book value $48.04/sh, more than double current stock price. 
- Cash on hand now approx $30/sh increases LBO possibility. 
- Current stock price is down 80% from the high so Risk/Reward strongly favors ZIM. 
- Institutional Investors are net acquirers of shares including Mutual Funds and ETF&#39;s.,2023-01-21T17:42:35Z

$ZIM I think it&#39;s about to get entertaining here. I&#39;m just going to sit here, holding my shares and collecting cash while I watch the house of cards fall as everyone realizes this company has a boatload of cash and is still making money despite the headwinds. What will they do with all that money? Give it to the shareholders of course.,2023-01-20T21:57:02Z
$ZIM month over month inflation in Canada just went negative. Lots of talk about lowering rates. Lots of talk about over doing it with interest rates.  
 
If I was a short seller I would be covering everything right now.  
 
These people are insane. Go short tesla or something instead jeez.  
 
If the FED pivots it won&#39;t be a gradual comeback. It&#39;s going to be a face ripper as everyone who is sitting on cash will be qued to go back in again at the same time short sellers get pants&#39;d  and can&#39;t get out.  
 
There is a lot of cash sitting in peoples accounts right now. Everyone is waiting for the right time, whatever that means.,2023-01-20T21:43:03Z
