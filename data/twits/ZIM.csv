My alerts for LARGE caps. I have timestamps + buy fills for everything What&#39;s my win rate?

I ONLY buy when Algos are tired of selling. How? I buy when &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; is low.

It&#39;s a simple strategy. Learn what &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; by Algos.

I don&#39;t make 100s of trades. I only buy when I get a confirmation. Ask me for the receipts. 

Next, I&#39;ll trade $ATVI + $CRWD + $SNOW + $ZIM + $NVAX,2023-01-01T23:57:46Z

Shippers say they canâ€™t make money at this rate.

$ZIM Forgive my ignorance; I am trying to learn. Why did this stock go up 6.6% on Thursday, Dec. 29? (I get why it dropped 4.92% on Friday; my supposition is that people wanted to take their gains from Thursday.),2022-12-31T12:46:37Z
$ZIM Is there two Earth or what? 
ZIM and GSL are container transporter firms but  ZIM has more services (8 vehicle transport vessels).  ZIM provides door-to-door and port-to-port transportation services.  
 
ZIM EPS next Year -95% (by finviz) 
GSL EPS next Year +8% (by finviz) 
 
I really don&#39;t understand this situation. 
 
Analysts corrupt? Someone make a big mistake in prediction. 
 
Please fix it if I&#39;m wrong.,2022-12-31T11:22:37Z
$ZIM any thoughts on the q4 dividend if the Company continues to track at revised guidance given in Q3 presentation?,2022-12-31T09:54:52Z
