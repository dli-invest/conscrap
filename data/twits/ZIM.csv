$ZIM New Retail Container Import Data released on April 8, 2022 
 
Retail analysts expecting record container imports for 2022, up 20% over 2020 and over 1.6% above 2021. 
 
Very bullish for $ZIM $DAC $KEN 
 
&quot;The first six months of 2022 are expected to total 13.1 million TEU, up 2.5 percent year-over-year. Imports for all of 2021 totaled 25.8 million TEU, a 17.4 percent increase over 2020‚Äôs previous annual record of 22 million TEU.&quot;

$ZIM Container Shipping Rates are rising everywhere except in/out of China.  When the China COVID lockdowns are eased, significant port congestions will ensue and extremely fast rate increases will follow. 
 
&quot;The CEO and founder of supply chain freight platform Shifl, Shabsie Levy, said ‚ÄúThe return to normality in Chinese operations may come at an inopportune moment, if it coincides with the ILWU longshoremen contract negotiations, which have traditionally seen port operations stalled across the ports of LA and LB, lengthening vessel queues, which could put pressure on rates,‚Äù said Mr Levy. 
 
Meanwhile, there is more pain for North European exporters to the US east coast, with for example the XSI recording a massive 20% jump this week for spot rates on the transatlantic, to $8,558 per 40ft, and the Freightos Baltic Index (FBX) reading up by 5%, to $8,037 per 40ft.

A reiteration of the thesis that when CHINA REOPENS FREIGHT RATES WILL EXPLODE: 
 
************************************ 
 
There is a distinct feeling of d√©j√† vu about the current lockdowns in China, with spot rates declining as carriers scramble for export cargo from shuttered manufacturing. 
 
But rates could spike again when the flood gates reopen for the delayed orders. 
 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost like a traffic jam,‚Äù said Container xChange CEO and cofounder Christian Roeloffs. 
 
‚ÄúAnd when demand is back, carriers will again not have enough equipment on the ground, as not enough containers went into China during the lockdowns. So that will push up prices again,‚Äù he added.

NINGBO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The China Ningbo Containerized Freight Index (NCFI), a wind vane of China&#39;s busiest port&#39;s freight rates for the international container shipping market, stood at 3,430.6 points on Friday, down 1.5 percent compared with last week. 
 
******************************* 
 
Drewry‚Äôs composite World Container Index decreased by 1.4% to $8,041.50 per 40ft container this week. 
 
Our detailed assessment for Thursday, 7 April 2022 
‚Ä¢ The composite index decreased by 1.4% this week, but, remains 64% higher than a year ago. 
‚Ä¢ The average composite index of the WCI, assessed by Drewry for year-to-date, is $9,116 per 40ft container, which is $5,908 higher than the five-year average of $3,208 per 40ft container.,2022-04-10T18:12:49Z

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It would appear the reopening of China is the key: 
 
********************************** 
 
Lars Jensen, CEO of consultancy Vespucci Maritime, wrote in a commentary published by the Baltic Exchange that China‚Äôs COVID lockdowns will reduce demand for space on ships sailing out of Shanghai in the very near term, meaning ‚Äúthere will be more vessel space available for other ports in the region and the expectation should therefore be for downward pressure on freight rates. 
 
‚ÄúOnce we see a reopening, the expectation should be for a surge of cargo coming out of Shanghai‚Äù which ‚Äúwill lead to a sharp upward pressure on freight rates.‚Äù

There are so many strong arguments on both sides of the FREIGHT RATE question, but I think investor&#39;s first instincts are to sell. 
 
**** 
 
The weekly Drewry assessment for Shanghai to LA came in at $8,824 per FEU on Thursday. That was down 20% from $10,986 in early Mar ‚Äî roughly mirroring the Platts numbers. Yet Drewry put the Shanghai to NY rate at $11,303 per FEU, down 19% from a Jan high of $13,987 ‚Äî the opposite of the rising trend reported by Platts. 
 
Xeneta puts the Far East-West Coast spot rate at $8,752 per FEU, plus optional premiums of $1,967-$5,503. This is up 9% from $8,021 on Jan. 2, the opposite of the downward trend on this route shown by Drewry and Platts. 
 
The Freightos Baltic Daily Index (FBX) ‚Äî which shows higher rates than others because it includes premiums in its trans-Pacific assessments ‚Äî was at $15,817 per FEU on Thursday for the Asia-West Coast route. That‚Äôs up 15% year to date. The Drewry assessment for this lane is down 21% YTD.,2022-04-10T18:06:54Z

Good article on reasoning for falling freight rates: 
 
What‚Äôs happening here exactly? Well the slump may be down to the time of the year. There‚Äôs often excess capacity around the time of the Lunar New Year, when Chinese factories close. Shabsie Levy of Shifl expects prices to rise again during peak season in the summer, though not to the levels witnessed in 2021.

$ZIM from what I can tell, rates tend to begin increasing around week 20-21 of the year...about the time the next dividend will be delivered...couple more weeks of pain, then we will start climbing back up the mountain... Fingers crossed,2022-04-10T12:32:25Z
$ZIM this chart shows the volatility, much higher than the market and the large volume. The other charts I have are for what everyone knows( earnings and financials) which are both very bullish. Basically the trend momentum, high short ratio and expert revisions have dropped the stock from very bullish to bullish to neutral+ overall. Basically the stock needs more investor interest, greater money flow, to push higher. The volume is there but with the short interest it can be concluded these people are trading the stock not investing in it. So we need a catalyst, probably earnings or some global economic news surprising to the upside. In the meantime, it‚Äôs best to accumulate at a discount.,2022-04-10T09:52:26Z
$ZIM this page shows, experts consensus towards the stock is trending neutral from previous bullish. Also to note short interest is high.,2022-04-10T09:43:43Z
$ZIM sharing info from a service I subscribe to. The first chart shows the money flow to the stock has gone from bullish sliding towards neutral( but not bearish). Relative strength, though, has dropped hard into oversold.,2022-04-10T09:42:07Z

$ZIM So assuming future quarters are at the $2.50 minimum( could very well higher), 70% of my position is not in Zim but in other stock none which pay a current dividend. But because of Zim I nett (after Israeli taxes) 10% div return on my whole portfolio. If not for Zim I would have to buy a considerable amount more of other stocks to get the same return or switch back to my previous 70-30 div stock to non div stock allocation and miss out on potential growth. That‚Äôs the power of Zim, bang for your buck.,2022-04-09T18:06:39Z
