$ZIM Will this go sub 20?,2023-04-21T01:14:58Z
@2comeback @MisterOldManInvestor Just a macro note. We&#39;ll see rates drop 2H23 while product inventories are cleared, followed by increasing gross tonnage. For the record, NOBODY can predict three years out in freight. There is a chance the share price hits new lows, but sitting it out may leave you w/o a position. My opinion is $ZIM should be at $43 right now. It&#39;s one of the best bets to trade.,2023-04-21T00:12:26Z

When will this $ZIM be as lively as a $TSLA?,2023-04-20T21:59:55Z
$ZIM why are there so many bulls here? Earnings are expected to drop into the negatives for the foreseeable future. This company took advantage of the Covid stay-at-home shipping boom of the last 2 years. Rates have collapsed back to the 50-year average. 

Seriously, what makes you bullish from here?,2023-04-20T21:50:21Z
$ZIM my opinion only but if management ever expects this to be valued properly then they should initiate a buy back with all that free cash. There is no way short sellers will ever allow this be properly valued otherwise. The fact they would allow this to flounder consistently between this $20-25 channel is questionable.,2023-04-20T21:21:39Z
