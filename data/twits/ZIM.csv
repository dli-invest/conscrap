$ZIM ZIM’s total cash position (which includes cash and cash equivalents and investments in bank deposits and other investment instruments) increased by $1,255 million from $3,850 million as of December 31, 2021 to $5,105 million at March 31, 2022. ZIM-Earnings-Release-FINAL-18-5-2022-accessible.pdf (q4cdn.com) 
 
After Q4 2021 dividend payout of $17/share (over $2.04 billion), ZIM is now sitting on over $3 billion in cash. In 2021, the company had total operating expenses of less than $4 billion (against over $10.7 billion in revenue). By this math, the company could make no revenue for the entirety of 2022 and still have enough $ to cover the entirety of its operating expenses with cash (retained earnings) on hand.,2022-06-03T17:27:37Z
