$ZIM 

A.P. Moller-Maersk (AMKBY) announced on February 15, 2023 that shareholders of record as of March 29, 2023 would receive a dividend of $2.20 per share on April 17, 2023. 

Last year AMKBY currently paid investors $1.30 per share, or 11.58%, on an annual basis.

$ZIM To be consistent and according to past statements of wanting to pay regular quarterly dividends, the next payment date should be around 3/8. I&#39;m guessing that since there hasn&#39;t even been an earnings announcement date, this is going to slip. So much for trying to establish a quarterly policy.,2023-02-19T16:59:10Z

$ZIM I wouldn‚Äôt touch this stock with a 10ft stick. Once the meme crowd jumps on board, all logic goes out the window.  
 
I have no thoughts on the direction of this stock. Or of the company in a general sense. But that is reason enough to stay the-f away. I might as well go play crypto-roulette. 
 
Also equities that attract memidiots tend also to lose money rather quickly with all the new attention. Not sure how exactly, but no one knows how to mess a good thing up quite like the ‚Äújump aboard this rocket‚Äù crowd.  
 
A shame for the real investors involved.,2023-02-19T08:08:10Z

$ZIM is there a way to find out who all the major investors in Zim are ?,2023-02-18T20:52:32Z
$ZIM Did I forget how to do elementary school math .. or does this really pay nearly $12 per year .. based on the last quarter payout of $2.95? .. and what was up with the $17 pay out 1st quarter 2022? Again, maybe I forgot how to use a calculator ü§∑,2023-02-18T19:25:22Z
$ZIM  
The truth is that &quot;Stock price predictions&quot; are a joke and they are ALWAYS wrong. They are always wrong because those who do the &quot;predicting&quot; intentionally &quot;under predict&quot; so... 
they....always look like a &quot;hero&quot;. :) 
The greater truth is...ZIM is owned by &quot;Israeli&quot;.. 
that is Jewish...businessmen, who will ALWAYS &quot;Look out for number one&quot;. They will always find a way to pump this back to $ 90.00 to  
$ 100.00 a share. 
THAT is where each of them will &quot;Make the money&quot;. And, so will we. :) 
Ignore EVERYTHING anyone says about this company and alleged &quot;news reports&quot;. :) 
ZIM is a winner. :) 
Best to everyone. :),2023-02-18T17:09:35Z

I&#39;m so sick of these profiles trying to sell their bullsh*t algo stuff, of teenies polluting my watchlist stream with their stupid questions and comments, of &quot;professionals&quot; who claim to have +10 years of experience in trading and try to sell their courses! +10 years in the market and still trying to sell your sh*t here to teenies? Poor little guys! 
For the serious traders here, block these guys as you encounter them!

$ZIM so many bagholders here just desperate to get any dividend (looks to be less than prior payments) in order to jump ship. 
 
No loyalty or confidence. Just pathetic memeidiots circling a carcass for the last few scraps of a meat when all that is left is blood stains, sun bleached bones and broken dreams. 
 
So funny to watch.,2023-02-18T07:11:03Z
