Maersk said Wednesday that freight rates will stay elevated as supply chain pressures persist. According to the company, congestion in sectors such as trucking and warehousing in mainland China, have created &quot;bottlenecks, resulting in challenged supply chain management services and elevated rates.&quot; 
 
The company&#39;s average freight rate jumped 71% in the first quarter from a year earlier.

$ZIM hope you guys are part of the 1% of people who made money this week!,2022-05-07T00:24:21Z
$ZIM How good does it feel to ride out one of the worst weeks in recent memory with 5 consecutive green days?  Ever since that fateful Monday just a couple weeks ago we have absolutely ripped.  We&#39;re sailing along (pun intended) and riding out this intense bear market on a made for sea rocket.  Just imagine how good we&#39;re going to be once we can take some of our profits and dividends and re-deploy back into the main market once the bottom has been hit!  Double/triple (everything you have) down on ZIM in the coming weeks, there is no better investment option right now in the market.   Only fantastic news to come (China lockdown easing, other competitors releasing and beating earnings, and then we release our Q1 ass-kicking performance, meanwhile announcements of more dividends (and maybe a buy-back scheme?).  Enjoy!  In this moment I sip my scotch and puff my cigar, cheers to you all and have a blessed weekend.,2022-05-07T00:11:44Z

$GSL Yolo&#39;ed into savings as $ZIM has been treating me well. Put an order in after seeing the early dip to under 23 and what do you know, managed to snag the bag at $22.75 when the bottom in the afternoon was only $22.74.

$ZIM corrected a little into the close, but still up 49 cents is better than a kick in the head...,2022-05-06T20:09:08Z
$ZIM this is strong as fuck....They are desperately trying to get under 65.00 so they dont have to pay out those calls and cannot do it...,2022-05-06T19:46:44Z
$ZIM Sold something else, and bought another 410 of $ZIM,2022-05-06T19:37:12Z
$ZIM No way this keeps paying that high of a dividend.... right??üëÄ,2022-05-06T18:57:47Z
I always find it confusing and annoying when $ZIM trades &gt;1% in green and $DAC trades &gt;3% in red on no news that I can see.  Is it just the ZIM dividend yield?  Long both.,2022-05-06T18:14:59Z
$TGH this is ridiculously cheap here, same as $DAC and $GSL. They don&#39;t have such a fat dividend like $ZIM , but they do have great management and way more stable cash flows for the future. $TGH  has a very aggressive share buyback program approved (10% of the shares) meaning they are going to return lots to shareholders. Even better risk X return than $zim. Still, whole sector looking great!,2022-05-06T18:10:15Z
$ZIM Scott does a nerdy great job evaluating companies.  Recommend you follow him on YouTube.  

His $ZIM summary  for those too lazy to watch, 6 weeks ago it was trading at todays price of $66/share and he had them at a 58% discount.  $ZIM, $VALE, $MP
