@kingmoneyy @StayFocused402 
You‚Äôre bullish on $CS and $VRM but bearish on $ZIM.  Maybe they both finally will reverse but they have been a damn train wreck. I will stick with all my solid dividend stocks. Good luck!
They have made massive large profits the past few years!,2023-03-08T02:42:01Z
$ZIM Why are you all butt hurts so bad when i last posted 1.50 divy this quarter?  I own Zim stock too, but I also own EGLE, SBLK, DSX, GOGL, and they all cutting their divy this quarter except dsx (haven&#39;t posted it).  I hope I&#39;m wrong, but it seem like it will going to cut divy just like others.  I wish they can offer $17 like last year first quarter but their stock price was over $60, now is just tick over $20...,2023-03-08T02:17:44Z

Probably worth pointing out that more recent EPS consensus for Q4 ‚Äò22 is closer to 2.21-2.26 which makes the estimated upcoming dividend range $0.66-$8.44. 
 
But I sincerely doubt that the top-up will be the full 20% as it is repeatedly labeled as optional by the ZIM executive team; and a company facing 2 years of negative estimated earnings(est. EPS of -$1.52 FY ‚Äò23 &amp; -4.95 FY ‚Äò24) would be handicapping themselves for any planned investments by emptying their coffers for an optional one-time outlay.  
 
So much more likely is 5-10% top-up which put the pretax dividend amount at between $2.54 - $4.42. Then deduct 25% foreign dividend withholding tax (unless you pay substantial dividend taxes already) for a net of $1.91-3.32.  
 
All this risk for a very underwhelming yield followed by possibly no dividends until 2025. And the real possibility of a 66 cent dividend is disappointing to say the least.,2023-03-07T23:03:07Z

$ZIM whole market is red today. Zim is not. The market is pricing in the fed increase this month. Zim is already oversold so it will do its 1 percent increases til Friday. Friday will be surge to anticipate earnings. And next week crazy green days cause the short loads have only decreases 2 percent. Which means they gonna get squeezed. Too many peeps will want their quick 30 percent payday for short amount of time.,2023-03-07T22:04:31Z
$ZIM  
 
So much desperarion in one place can be overwhelming at times. 
 
ZIM is one of the least sophisticated plays of the past year.   
 
A bunch of failed traders chasing an earnings  based dividend from a company who no longers has any earnings.  
 
There is no loyalty to this stock. The same despearate losers who jumped onboard when this was on its way down will jump off the moment an opportunity arises - most likely after the upcoming &amp; disappointingly small ex-div date leaving behind only the epic stupid.

$ZIM I get it, shorties are panicking because retail investors will enter ZIM and skew their balance of power. Freaking out about all the money you&#39;re about to potentially lose. Don&#39;t manipulate markets or short stocks you cannot afford and you won&#39;t have this problem.

I have zero sympathy for you &amp; your little club of frens. I&#39;ll give a toast &amp; be celebrating as your money burns. Why? Because I can &amp; I don&#39;t agree with your tactics.,2023-03-07T20:31:10Z
$ZIM doing fine given the market,2023-03-07T20:19:41Z
@antifapat @Hanna22 sorry you got caught bag holding pat but lessons learned right?

I had been in AGNC for several months recently, but exited 100% before the decline and had made 40% on increased stock value plus the minor dividends.

I&quot;m not interested in chasing pennies in risky investments like AGNC, especially when far better opportunities are available in international companies like $ZIM.

I keep a foundational base of relatively safe investments like $GAIN, $GLAD, $BSTZ, but ones like $ZIM are what drive my ability to generate growth and profits for  the long-term. Those others have lesser dividends but it adds to the pool and allows me to go after higher yielding ones like $ZIM.,2023-03-07T19:22:14Z
$ZIM ... common pattern with this stock. If the dividend is $5, then the stock will be up by the same amount until the day before ex-dividend date ie. $27. Then, it will fall by $7 the following day. Ie. $20.,2023-03-07T19:16:31Z
@Hanna22 2/2 $ZIM would be a stock that people could love long-term but benefit from the swings of the market.

It&#39;s typical for investors to enter their position and after the date of record to be rewarded with the dividend payout, sell upwards of 80-95% of their position to recoup their investments as well as paying themselves the profits from dividend plus any additional stock value increase.

It&#39;s typical for a stock that doesn&#39;t pay a flat regular dividend to decrease in value after quarterly dividend payouts, so getting out before the expected decline allows you to wait on the price drop to re-enter at a discount.

In the case of $ZIM, expected re-entry could be in the 15-18 dollars range within two weeks following the dividend record date.

Investors do this, because if you&#39;re just continuously putting money in, without paying yourself the profits of the increases in value, it&#39;s highly likely to be left &#39;holding the bag&#39; so to speak, when the downturn arrives.,2023-03-07T19:15:43Z
@Hanna22 if your goal is to just buy in, leave your money sitting there, and steady long-term growth, it doesn&#39;t make sense to pick these stocks you have mentioned. Other more stable stocks, with history of increased value in share price as well as stable dividend payments that increase with time or maintain, such as $GAIN and $GLAD are far better opportunities.

Just because you&#39;re long on a stock, doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t take advantage of swing opportunities. $ZIM is an outstanding example of this as ultra high dividend yield from a company constantly outperforming industry competitors.

Major year end annual dividend about to be announced Monday March 13th, not the 17.00 per share of last year, but realistic expectations are ranging from 6-10 a share and it&#39;s extremely under valued at sub 25 dollars right now.

1/2,2023-03-07T19:08:31Z
$ZIM were getting a $9 dividend so should see this thing run around 18 bucks to 40 we go,2023-03-07T18:59:45Z
@MikeShoe2A no, not in the short-term. Pennies saved, dollars wasted literally. Monday March 13th is $ZIM big annual dividend payment announcement, expected in the range of 6-10 dollars per share. For sub 25.00 you stand to benefit from 4.50 after tax payout instead of 0.40 with ARR for the same 25.00

After the date of record passes on ZIM, sell upwards of 80-95% of your position, to recoup investment plus paying yourself profits &amp; look for an opportunity to make a re-entry on your position over the following two weeks with an expected price decline to around 15.00-18.00 dollar range.

You can still enter ARR afterwards but in a better position with having additional profits from dividend &amp; value increase from ZIM, plus additional shares of ZIM just sitting there.

By Friday this week the discount will start to evaporate.

Food for thought, worthwhile to look at the company history and fundamentals of $ZIM.,2023-03-07T18:52:30Z
