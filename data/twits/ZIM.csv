$ZIM I have two sincere questions. Please forgive my ignorance. 
 
Q. If this stock meets or exceeds projected earnings, what do you think will happen to the price? Conversely, if earnings are low, will the stock likely plummet? 
 
Q #2. Many bulls on this board made reasoned arguments, citing data, that they see this stock jumping to $30 or higher. They were vocal from Thursday to Sunday. Bulls, do you still feel that way today? 
 
Thank you for your patience with my beginner&#39;s questions.,2022-11-15T01:37:21Z

$ZIM this stock will rise tomorrow.,2022-11-14T23:25:26Z
$ZIM Regardless of what the earning will be, Q4 will be brutal given the tanking freight rates, especially ZIM relies heavily on spot rates and China/West coast route. Next few quarters will be ugly.,2022-11-14T23:19:27Z
$ZIM is this a recently bottomed out dividend stock?,2022-11-14T22:36:12Z
$ZIM I don‚Äôt believe even a double beat will give rise to our share price by any meaningful measure. They forecast for future quarters and overall economic health remain bleak and that will matter much more than the previous quarter. I‚Äôm as hopeful as anyone here to be wrong but I know I won‚Äôt be. I‚Äôm in for like $50 for 1500 and bag holding long term. I expect $3ish bucks pre foreign tax payout and a drop to $20-$22 afterwards. Less if we don‚Äôt beat this quarters estimates.,2022-11-14T22:32:16Z

$ZIM Any DD here? 100% yield and PE less than 1. What am I missing? High debt?,2022-11-14T17:25:05Z
$MULN shorts are dumb enough to think that huge institutions like Vangaurd would buy millions of shares to make $ on lending them to shorts hahahhahaa  
 
$ZIM is yielding 100% right now and $T was at a 7% yield last month, but yeah I am sure Vanguard is like hey instead of buying those let&#39;s buy 22 million shares of a highly speculative ev player so we can make money on 7%-20% yield with potential downside risk.  
 
Get the fuck outta here, these bears are dumber than I thought. $1 by Christmas!,2022-11-14T17:14:44Z
