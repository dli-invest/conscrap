(^^^ This is an excellent article) 
 
Sea freight is crashing. I called this in April. Of course it&#39;s crashing. Retailers were fighting each other to get their inventory from China to capture the stimulated consumer flush with cash (see savings rate). This sent spot rates flying, along with crammed ports and super high shipping costs = inflationary costs passed onto the flush consumer who can take it. 
 
Now that the consumer is tapped out, retailers are stuck with massive amounts of inventory they&#39;ll have to discount and they&#39;re not ordering anymore.

$ZIM shipping is having a record year and zim is trading 1.2 P/E! Complete nonsense. Even if rates and demand go down, ZIM is Israeli shipping company! Guess who is stepping up oil production to Europe and Asia and has no pipelines and will need ships to do so ? üáÆüá±,2022-06-09T01:38:31Z
