$ZIM how much this next dividend?,2022-11-03T05:03:31Z
$ZIM Estimated S.I as on   11/2/22 17.32 Percent          
               
 While we are specialized in highly shorted stock  we don‚Äôt miss out on other opportunities in the market. Join me via stocktwits.com/mrshort, for stock alerts. We are up 30% trading SPY and TESLA today.

$ZIM just hold and let the shorts chase their on tail.,2022-11-03T02:07:05Z
$ZIM Gentle reminder that when you enter a Sell order, regardless of price your shares are immediately withdrawn from the shares available to borrow by short sellers.  They only have 600k left in ammo after their attack today.  Think like Ukraine and attack their ammo supply.  I put in a GTC sell at $200 for all my shares.  We want a short squeeze so please help the cause,2022-11-02T23:20:05Z
$ZIM This is my plan, and I&#39;d like your opinion &amp; reasoning: 
 
* It cratered today because: a) the Fed raised interest rates; b) the U.S. Midterm elections are coming up; and c) Biden. 
* The dividend of November/December 2022 and Feb./March 2023 will both be awe-inspiring. 
* This stock may be in the 40s to 60s by June. 
 
Thus, I will hold ZIM for at least a month, and preferably for 2023 or longer. 
 
What are your thoughts and plans?,2022-11-02T21:46:22Z
$ZIM shipping rates are down because more supply chains open up to cover the cost of transportation. The amount of profit is going to be similar.,2022-11-02T21:35:51Z
$ZIM could be a value trap ü™§ with shipping rates dropping and no more covid stimulus from world governments profits could keep crashing for the coming years as we head into a deep global slow down. Could stay pinned for years. Recession just beginning,2022-11-02T21:33:11Z
$ZIM I&#39;ll be out of work soon because I&#39;ll be collecting dividend.,2022-11-02T21:32:12Z

$ZIM in the low 20‚Äôs, $GOOGL @ $86 and $AMZN @$92, what is this wizardry ü§© Load the boat!,2022-11-02T21:11:41Z
$ZIM I was writing about ZIM earlier this year, and I&#39;m still cont with the plan of the long hold over many years hopefully.  At these levels, I feel like I&#39;m getting something like IEP at a discount.  Hopefully over time it will rise again which will be a nice bonus.,2022-11-02T20:53:47Z
$ZIM shocked, 200@22.75 filled.,2022-11-02T20:06:00Z
$ZIM    BALLS!!!!   That is all.,2022-11-02T20:05:09Z
$ZIM only people crying is people that don&#39;t know they pay a divvy. The fed raised rates is the only reason this stock is down .,2022-11-02T20:01:51Z
$ZIM super undervalue and mispriced. compare zim to maersk. maersk is up 10-15% from 29-sept. while zim is below. it show that theres large amount of shorts instead of real selling.,2022-11-02T19:55:54Z
$ZIM bears you‚Äôre right 

What a POS this has been. Long term investors getting the shaft üòÇ stop thinking short term and learn to zoom out. ZIM hasn‚Äôt been public long but so far so good ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,2022-11-02T19:53:23Z
