$dac $zim- potential reversal play...if it sinks at the open $dac --- Charter rates have fallen significantly but remain higher than pre-pandemic levels. However, charter durations rarely exceed 12 months. 
 
Fortunately, we are insulated from current market conditions as 93% of our available days are already contracted for 2023, providing us with excellent visibility for the year ahead. Given our limited near-term downside risk and our minimal debt obligations, we have ample firepower to opportunistically take advantage of the forthcoming downturn.,2023-02-15T02:26:35Z

$ZIM Has anyone been able to obtain K-1?,2023-02-14T22:36:09Z
$ZIM 1 billion net for Q4 - that’s 117 million less than Q3 to be safe. Anything close to 1 billion net for Q4 puts us at $11.11 Divi @ 50% catch up. Minus 25% withholding puts us at $8.33. SP I predict will get upwards of $25-26 pre Divi. SP prediction is purely speculative but Divi estimate is solid at an estimate of 1 billion net for Q4 with 50% catch up Divi. Every hundred million you deduct from the over all estimated net for Q4 estimate a $1 drop in Divi. So if you estimate 800 million net for Q4 a 50% catch up Divi puts us at 6.83.,2023-02-14T21:59:13Z
