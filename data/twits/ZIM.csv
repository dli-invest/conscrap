$ZIM  opinion? Hell yes. If you think Putin is bad news, wait for the fanatic Mullahs to go nuclear. The world will be longing for the &quot;good ol&#39; Putin days&#39;&quot;.

In short: I HOPE the people of Iran will succeed with the revolution. It&#39;s the best option. But if they fail, the nuke facilities MUST be destroyed.
And hopefully the regime of IR terrorists will crumble.

The world will be a better place without them, Hizbollah, Hamas and Putin.,2023-03-16T04:38:46Z

$ZIM &quot;Take the FBRC example above, for instance. The firm paid a $7.61 dividend on June 1, 2017, with an ex-dividend date of June 2, 2017. The record date for the dividend was May 31, 2017, so given trade settlement times of 3 days, an investor would have needed to buy the stock by May 28 in order to be paid the dividend. In this case, though, May 28 was a Sunday, so the investor would have had to buy by Friday, May 26.&quot; Source: dividend.com (why-special-dividends-have-ex-dividend-date-after-pay-date/).,2023-03-16T02:37:40Z
$ZIM &quot;In the case of a special dividend of 25% or more, however, special rules that are quite different apply. If you sell stock after the record date but before the ex-dividend date, your shares will be sold with a book entry sometimes called a &quot;due bill,&quot; which denotes that (though the company will pay the dividend to your account, if you are the shareholder of record on the date two business days prior to the record date), your account must, in turn, turn the amount of that dividend over to the buyer of your stock. Conversely, if you buy stock after the record date but before the ex-dividend date of a large special dividend, you are entitled to the dividend and will receive it via the due bill process.&quot; Source Wikipedia &quot;Special_dividend&quot; article.,2023-03-16T02:33:45Z
$ZIM.   Is it OK to let people think you can buy after the ex-dividend day to hold the price up a bit?,2023-03-16T02:17:27Z
$ZIM @vinland. I am not sure can buy between RD and XDate and get the Div. 
I think you MUST own the shares by Record Date.  If you buy after the RD, you will not get the Div.  
 
You may want to reevaluate your plan. Also let me know if I am wrong ?,2023-03-16T02:13:48Z
$ZIM if you were to buy 5000 shares of ZIM in 3/2021 and reinvested all dividends to stock you&#39;d own 12,000 shares now ...that was a brand NEW company then ,since they have made HUGE milestones in fortifying their buis. thats 140% gain w no tax implications...I feel this year run will make that look meek I&#39;m seeing a 300% in one year with dividend reinvested coupled w stock price increase in a YEAR! w/no RISK*** oh yeah and the short squeeze thats coming...WHOA,2023-03-16T01:52:43Z
$PXS squeezing tomorrow. Record earnings coming. 4.8M public float 6M inside ownership. Your welcome  $ZIM $DWAC $TSLA,2023-03-16T01:34:38Z
$ZIM dry good index up by 230% since 1/2023 that means june DIV will be bigger!!! maybe $12?,2023-03-16T01:30:06Z
@2beeorNot3g ZIM has a multitude of income streams. Dry Goods, containers, roro (roll-on, roll-off), reefer, etc.  They are generally well insulated against a crash in any given market. Conversely, they are well positioned to take advantage of profit in any sector.  
 
Plus as an asset lite business model, they (in theory)  could more easily shift their fleet to welcome whichever sector is heating up for the upcoming cycle.  
 
Additionally, they&#39;re investing in companies that will define the future of shipping. Everyone else will come along kicking and screaming.  
 
Do your own research, but I think $ZIM is a solid choice.,2023-03-16T01:29:09Z
Compared to an average Enterprise Value to EBITDA ratio of 3.02, $ZIM is valued rather cheaply. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/analyzer/stock/ZIM?view=fundamental-analysis&amp;key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2023-03-16T01:28:00Z
@Mckartt shorts have been panicking the last few days. hence the pressure to keep price low. But as you see, average joe and average jane (plus whatever big money does) are outpacing the shorts. $ZIM over $24!,2023-03-16T01:24:21Z
$ZIM Just a reminder, since this is a greater than 25% special dividend, you need not own shares by the March 24 record date. You can buy anytime between record date and exdate to get the div as long as you hold into exdate.  
I&#39;ll be buying some after record date on any decent dip. GL!,2023-03-16T01:23:56Z
