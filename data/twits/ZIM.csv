$ZIM Whenever someone backs up their comments with &quot;Do your own research. You don&#39;t pay me to teach you&quot; 9 times out of 10 they are full of shit üòÜ 
 
If you&#39;re not interested in &quot;teaching&quot;, why even post the comment/statement/info to start with? 
 
If you&#39;re making an investment based on something you read here, always verify. Just because someone posts a lot here doesn&#39;t mean they know WTF they are talking about. I&#39;ve found it to be the opposite.,2023-01-07T19:47:18Z

$ZIM very strong move on the greenest spy day,2023-01-07T10:38:35Z
$ZIM I love the stock I just wondering why they have to pay a huge chunk of income as dividends. They ipo about 18 bucks, rip to 90.00 and now back down.,2023-01-07T09:24:45Z
$ZIM So the assumption is that the final 2022 dividend ( regardless of being 2 or 5 or 10 ) is not going to move the stock on a net basis ? It runs up same value and then drops. And 17 is the price for all pain that&#39;s coming in 2023 / 2024.,2023-01-07T07:20:00Z

$ZIM Don&#39;t just think about shipping. Think about where they ship, how many ports, what they ship, what they use to ship, ingenuity  and on and on. Definitely make up your own minds based on your own digging. Knowing analysts are out for themselves is good information. How can you use that to your advantage is the key.

$ZIM 32 EPS FULL YEAR FORECAST. 50 PERCENT OFF. BARGAIN,2023-01-06T21:08:01Z
$ZIM this is essentially a binary play at this point. It all depending on true-up dividend and dividend going forward. If they affirm the true-up dividend, this could go back to 25+, if they reduce or nix, could easily get to low 10s.,2023-01-06T20:38:59Z
$ZIM added a few more shares going as wide as a ocean and as deep as a piss puddle with funds spreading the love all over this market,2023-01-06T19:38:56Z
$ZIM its like watching people discuss the price of canadian oil in 2017.  
 
World price was  $40 and Canadian bitumen hits a record discount selling for $11 barrel. . 
Analysts are calculating that the cost of extraction of bitumen is $5 barrel therefore cenovus is &quot;still good&quot; even if prices drop to $6 then the stock is fairly valued if oil stays at $6 barrel forever.  
 
3 months later it&#39;s back up to $30 with world price of $40 thanks to Canada&#39;s production cap.  
 
And now the industry is screaming of shortages again.,2023-01-06T19:04:18Z

The liner bonanza isn‚Äôt over yet ‚Äî high contract rates should keep outsized profits flowing well into this year. But with the historic super-cycle winding down, it‚Äôs time to take stock of how fleets evolved over the past three years.
Alphaliner released its overview of 2022 fleet changes on Tuesday. Together with Alphaliner‚Äôs historical records, the data shows that the aggregate market share of the top 10 lines has stayed steady through the super-cycle ‚Äî now at 85% of the global fleet versus 84% in early 2020 ‚Äî but with big changes among individual players.

Zim: While several lines grew due to newbuilds ordered pre-pandemic, others specifically increased capacity to take advantage of the booming freight market. One was MSC, which grew by buying second-hand ships. Another was Israel‚Äôs Zim (NYSE: ZIM), the 10th-largest carrier, which used a different strategy: Chartering.,2023-01-06T18:08:32Z
