$ZIM 

Credit Suisse and banks going down under, Bond yields going lower - What does it mean?

1. Housing and other goods demand picks up to a normal level - More shipping reqd.
2. Interest on leasing the ships goes down

Both tailwinds for ZIM shipping prices for a cash burn of $2 Bn over next two years otherwise.,2023-03-18T21:40:22Z

$ZIM 100% agree.  This doesn‚Äôt even need a short squeeze.  Did you see their balance sheet?  Rev $12.56B?  Net income $4.63B?  Literally show me a balance sheet this good:

$ZIM  shorts or no shorts. This is a $30 stock trading at $25, with $6.40 div.

So, I&#39;d say there is an easy $ 11-12 gain per share, potential here.

One more thing, although they have variable div rates, the company is DEFINITELY investors/ Div oriented. Hence I don&#39;t see the Div going away in the future.,2023-03-18T18:56:33Z

$ZIM when looking at trailing data this is undervalued. But when you look at currant future perceived data it‚Äôs not undervalued at all. Check out the currant container rates. I‚Äôm going to hold, but I‚Äôm not expecting large dividends going forward. If any dividends at all. 

https://fbx.freightos.com/,2023-03-18T15:27:44Z
$ZIM Even without a short squeeze.  This doesn‚Äôt need to squeeze to do well in the short term.  By no means do you need to be banking on a short squeeze to be bullish on this.  With a monster $6.40 dividend being paid April 4th there should be buying between Monday and the 24th anyway‚Ä¶no need for a squeeze.  This should go up on fundamentals and dividend pay out alone.

Even if it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt it be prudent for short sellers to cover BEFORE having to pay an additional $6.40/share‚Ä¶why would they want to hold through that rather than cover now?  Even some covering will push price up‚Ä¶it‚Äôs blind sighted to think that‚Äôs not plausible.

It makes more sense to cover before the div (especially if they can unwind at least some of their position at lower prices) before paying the div.  Then short again post record date expecting it to correct after ex-div date.,2023-03-18T15:13:23Z
$ZIM  
People here talk a lot about short holders, as though they are all powerful in one breath, manipulating the price up and down by $ at a time 
 
And then I‚Äôm the next breath they try to drum up support for a short squeeze as though the firms that hold major short positions don‚Äôt basically have unlimited resources to cover in a moment‚Äôs notice 
 
These funds have sophisticated models that have priced in any eventuality and they are absolutely able to buy up their positions nearly immediately if things go south 
 
Have a look at the names of the firms that hold major short positions? Jeffries, Goldman, etc. And their entry points can be high (in other words, they have already made a lot of money off of people here), so they can wait out selling for a long time 
 
There will be no short squeeze. The stock will trade sideways for a long time. And the little players here who borrowed to buy will get bored and sell. The price will fall and the shorts will make money as usual,2023-03-18T14:51:19Z

$ZIM It is definitely not too late to buy shares.  To receive the div you need to buy by Friday, the 24th‚Ä¶shorts need to cover before then.  Selling pressure has to be minimum with the record date on the 24th even in the unlikely scenario that FOMC announces 50bps on the 22nd.  If they announce a pause in rate hikes ZIM should still benefit from immense buying pressure as people pile in to receive the dividend on the 4th!

What a beautiful set up for this week!!!,2023-03-18T14:18:12Z
$ZIM Huge start to the week this week.  The dividend record date is March 24th.  If you don‚Äôt have shares by the 24th you will not receive the $6.40 dividend on April 4th.  Short sellers need to pay the $6.40 dividend to whoever they have borrowed the shares from on top of the $6.40 paid out by ZIM.  Because the record date is this Friday, March 24th, if shorts hold until then they will be recorded as being short shares and will be forced to pay the $6.40‚Ä¶they NEED to cover this week.

In the current macroeconomic environment I don‚Äôt see a better spot than this this week!
