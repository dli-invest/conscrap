$ZIM I realize the odd timing of events when there is &gt;25% Dividend involved just confuses the toes right off people that don&#39;t understand the Due Bill process. But in the end, all dividends are the same. If you buy it at least one day before EX Date and hold until EX Date then you are golden if the dividend was your goal. Don&#39;t stress over Record Dates or Settlement Dates or all the junk the NoNothings spew. It&#39;s just one date in the process to consider.,2023-03-24T20:52:40Z

$ZIM I believe everyone should be able to make fun of themselves. 

If you don&#39;t get out now your momma is going to have to pay 125% of my taxes on the divy I may or may not get on 4/4.  Your grandma will have to borrow all my shares to pay off her taxes on her broke car to the Israeli tax collector that may or may not have one eye. 🤔 shorts might be evil 😈 🤔 I&#39;m not sure how the market works.  Profit is bad for people that have a different strategy than I do for building wealth.,2023-03-24T19:37:38Z
