PERSPECTIVE ON PROFITS 
 
ONE conceded that the most recent quarter will be the high point. The reversal has already begun. It cited ‚Äústeady cargo movements‚Äù in July, followed by ‚Äúa sudden decline in transport demand in August and September.‚Äù 
 
Going forward, it warned that ‚Äúdue to the inventory build-up situation in North America and Europe‚Äôs entry into recession, it is expected to take some time for cargo movements and short-term freight rates to recover.‚Äù  
 
Even with predicted reductions, ONE expects its fiscal-year profits to total $15.3 billion, down 9% y/y but still its second-best fiscal year ever.   
 
To put the forecasted decline in perspective, ONE‚Äôs average quarterly net income in March-December 2019, pre-COVID, was $43.7 million. The average quarterly profits ONE expects in the next six months amid ‚Äúdeteriorating conditions‚Äù is 49 times higher. That‚Äôs a forecast most CEOs would envy, and one that does not meet the definition of a ‚Äúhard landing.‚Äù
