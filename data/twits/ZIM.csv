$ZIM 

Time to analyze the hell out of ZIM:

Most important to me:
- ROE = 118.43% (strong) 
- ROA = 54.02% (strong) 
- P/E = .46 (cheap!)
- Low PEG = (cheap!)
- Earnings per share = 205%, with growth of +400% the past 5 years (wow) 
- Altman z score =4.39 (strong) within the safe zone for bankruptcy risk.
- Piotroski z score = 8.00 (strong) high profitability and great health. 

Now bad:
- revenue growth is decreasing. 
- high debt
- huge dividend (wait,  why would that be bad?) Is simply not sustainable if revenue is dropping, but sucks people in.

So I think we have a good company, with good management going through really shitty times in Europe. I expect that it will drop further,  the dividend will likely either fall or be halted for the time being. 

Fundamentals say it will struggle further but is a huge discount right now. Technical is simply not there for buying and expecting a huge lift. This is buy and hold for years. No pumping and squeezing here. Overall bullish for longs.,2022-10-24T03:25:11Z

I‚Äôm trying to research into why ZIM had such a high Q2 dividend. Obviously it‚Äôs not a regular thing but why? Did they just have a good quarter like the CEO said in august, or was it due to Russia/Ukraine and the supply shortages?,2022-10-23T23:04:01Z

$ZIM: The low PEG Ratio, which compensates the PE for growth, indicates a rather cheap valuation of the company. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/ZIM/fundamental-analysis?key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-10-22T05:03:00Z
