$ZIM day trading is for suckered. Im buying the dip,2022-12-20T03:00:34Z
$ZIM I never expected this stock&#39;s price to fall so much. I bought around a month before dividend (240 shares @ avg $ 24). Otherwise I would&#39;ve waited to buy in. Disappointing, but it is what it is. I&#39;m waiting to see if it drops more, but if it drops below $15 I&#39;m buying more.,2022-12-20T01:55:49Z
$ZIM Ultimately, this should attract new dividend investors and thus support their share prices over time.,2022-12-20T01:41:55Z
$ZIM Facts, the lower their share prices go, the higher their dividend yields (the absolute amount of dividend dollars they pay divided by their share prices) rise.,2022-12-20T01:40:34Z
$ZIM someone buying AH for 17, is there news?,2022-12-20T00:57:19Z
$ZIM I think I rode the same train with $FUBO. Unbelievable how the shorts can destroy a company. This has incredible cash Reserves. I&#39;ll wait till next year and see if the wave builds going in to March. When you lose stock price far more than the dividend something is up.üòéüòéüòéü§ë,2022-12-20T00:50:57Z

$ZIM Drewry from this past Thursday. Alright, alright, I give you that is 42 DOWN WEEKS IN A ROW. Pretty depressing. Now herein is the catch....that 1% decrease is the lowest decrease in probably ALL OF THOSE WEEKS!! Now one low decrease does not a trend make, but, BUT perhaps we are at a bottom!! 
 
****************** 
 
Our detailed assessment for Thursday, 15 December 2022 
The composite index decreased by 1% this week, the 42nd consecutive weekly decrease, and has dropped by 77% when compared with the same week last year. 
 
The latest Drewry WCI composite index of $2,127 per 40-foot container is now 79% below the peak of $10,377 reached in September 2021. It is 21% lower than the 10-year average of $2,692, indicating a return to more normal prices, but remains 51% higher than average 2019 (pre-pandemic) rates of $1,420. 
 
The average composite index for the year-to-date is $6,547 per 40ft container, which is $3,855 higher than the 10-year average ($2,692 mentioned above).,2022-12-19T20:37:13Z

$ZIM Told you 15.00,2022-12-19T19:48:01Z
$ZIM  the next dividend is going to be quite interesting.  
 
I hope this is trading under 10 bucks by next EX.  
 
Can exchanges go negative?  
 
I am going to set a buy order for 1 cent good till filled  on the next  EX day.  
 
The exchanges might just force the price there with computers.  
 
The only question now is, who would ever sell there? Dividend snipers?,2022-12-19T19:42:16Z
