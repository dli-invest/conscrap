$UWMC all my divi hunters need to check out $ZIM for a stupidly high dividend yield that was just announced. $6.40 per share!!! Crazy!! Ex dividend date is Tuesday April 4th. GLTA!!,2023-03-15T04:35:03Z

This response is for US residents only. This is what I do...

Asset allocation X Asset location:

If you own $ZIM in Bucket 2 accounts. (IRAs and 4O1k) = no taxable events. No tax loss harvesting on the flip.
*ideal for short stop limit orders. Take profits...Capitalize on them swings.

Bucket 1 accounts. (Taxable brokerages)
I personally run for the long term dividends. Just do your little 61 days with the with ankle bracelet. Then you get qualified dividend status passport.  

*ideal for New Yorkers filing single status in the 32% tax bracket for higher.

If you still thirsty and not an ol head like me try covered calls.  

In terms of the taxes on your dividends- in your taxable brokerage accounts:

Get you a mid-range CPA and he/she will fill out the all tax credit forms for you. If you still doing your own shit on TurboTax.... work on that situation first.
