$ZIM Dividends paid on the 3rd until ex-date on 4th meaning you get paid for them before you purchase them.,2023-03-31T21:09:30Z
$ZIM I&#39;m not an expert but from what I read on the ZIM site the holder&#39;s of ordinary shares as of March 24th will receive the dividend. To be such one must be recorded by that date T2 which would be and owner as of  March 22nd. It takes 2 days to settle an account and be recorded as the owner. I could be wrong.,2023-03-31T20:15:14Z
$ZIM 2022 Dividends 
In accordance with the Company&#39;s dividend policy, ZIM&#39;s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of approximately $769 million, or $6.40 per ordinary share. Together with prior dividend distributions made on account of 2022, dividend distributions for the year totaled approximately 44% of the year&#39;s net income. The dividend will be paid on April 3, 2023, to holders of ZIM ordinary shares as of March 24, 2023. Since the foregoing declared dividend amount per share constitutes more than 25% of the Company&#39;s ordinary share price on the declaration date (March 13, 2023), per the instructions of the NYSE, the ex-dividend date with respect to this dividend distribution will be April 4, 2023. Shareholders who wish to receive the dividend must hold their ZIM shares until the ex-dividend date.,2023-03-31T20:10:22Z

$ZIM does the strike price of calls get reduced by the dividend price too or no?,2023-03-31T19:48:54Z
$ZIM Fidelity just advised me and if they are wrong there is an issue that if I sell my shares I will still get the dividend on Monday since it is 2 day settlement and i would have owned it on ex-div date.,2023-03-31T19:45:47Z
$ZIM  just dumped my shares. Took the profit and maybe buyback after the dip. Might be a mistake, time will tell.,2023-03-31T19:33:23Z
My alerts for LARGE caps. I have timestamps + buy fills for everything What&#39;s my win rate?

I ONLY buy when Algos are tired of selling. How? I buy when &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; is low.
I don&#39;t make 100s of trades. I only buy when I get a confirmation. Ask me for the receipts. 

Next, I&#39;ll trade $ATVI + $CRWD + $SNOW + $ZIM + $NVAX,2023-03-31T19:26:55Z
