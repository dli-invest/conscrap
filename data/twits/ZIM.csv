Our detailed assessment for Thursday, 05 January 2023 
The composite index increased by 0.7% this week, the first increase in 43 weeks, but has dropped by 77% when compared with the same week last year. 
 
The latest Drewry WCI composite index of $2,1235 per 40-foot container is now 79% below the peak of $10,377 reached in September 2021. It is 21% lower than the 10-year average of $2,694, indicating a return to more normal prices, but remains 50% higher than average 2019 (pre-pandemic) rates of $1,420. 
 
The average composite index for the year-to-date is $2,135 per 40ft container, which is $559 lower than the 10-year average ($2,694 mentioned above).,2023-01-05T20:35:40Z

One reason I&#39;m invested in $ZIM is that China has cancelled its zero-Covid policy. Large numbers of people are rapidly catching Covid and significant numbers are dying. That is unfortunate but it will pass quickly. In the meantime their economy is bound to pick up as more people get back to work and more barriers to productivity drop. I expect a new surge of shipping volume to follow. Both ways. What do you think?,2023-01-05T19:05:17Z
$ZIM  Market is valuing this stock, as it is going to lose money this year. Any Conservative guess how much eps can they earn this year. Even if it loses 90 percent of its revenue it would still make some money.,2023-01-05T18:52:03Z

$ZIM So how does the 25% Israeli tax work? I am assuming it&#39;s withheld by the company?  Would I have to report gross proceeds, then the tax paid, or do you report income net of the tax? Thanks for any input.,2023-01-05T15:37:33Z

$ZIM I would like to also clarify this for Delusional Bears üêª/ Shorties who making statement like ‚Äú if the shipping rate drop down to pre-Covid rate, @ZIM will burn through their cash (around 3-5billions dollars) in 3 years‚Äù. This is a total Delusional Statement that Bears make. WHY? In 2019 when shipping rate bounced between $1200s to $1400s. @ZIM posted a net loss of $0.19 a share. Translate that into real number it would be around $24 million dollars for the total of 120+millions share that the company has. To burn through 3 billions in cash. It would take 150 years to do so ( Assuming that shipping rate is the same and cost of oil and labor is the same). Taking it to the reality with increase oil prices and wages going up 10% a year. It will take $ZIM at least 30 to 40 years in business with no profit to be under water!!!,2023-01-05T14:14:52Z

$ZIM this is reality. Shipping index in 2020 bounced between $1300 and $2400 with the majority in the $1400s and $1500. Zim net profit was $518 Million dollars. If the rate dropping down to Pre-CoVid rate ( most likely will not). And for a conservative Net Profit of 2023 for $500 million ( actual number could bounce between 0.5 and 1.2 billions). For a dividend of 30%   ($1.5 dollar and $3.6 dollars a year) . Let‚Äôs say we will take the lowest possible number which is $1.5 and pay 25% of Israeli tax. We still net around $1.15 per share from dividend in 2023. Translate it to yield you will get a solid 6.76% per year. Which is still more than average compare to most of corporations out there!!! This is realistic number and it is still better than most investment!!,2023-01-05T04:45:46Z
