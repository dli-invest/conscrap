$ZIM still think the best way to play the div here is to sell at close day before ex div. Buy back the next morning on ex div day. You capture the FULL dividend amount, no foreign tax, and no other tax either bc you didn‚Äôt receive any income.,2023-03-28T01:12:29Z
@44milliondollarclub can you do $ZIM please?,2023-03-28T01:11:56Z
$ZIM I can&#39;t wait until after the divvy. These people shouldn&#39;t be buying something they don&#39;t understand. How about a nice mutual fund for them?,2023-03-27T23:48:39Z

$ZIM even with a divi tax..it still is better than 90%. Better than  other divi stocks out there...,2023-03-27T23:28:30Z
@LevinBurant this is going to be dragged to the bottom after ex-day. I predict a 65% discount on $ZIM on that day. It&#39;s going to be good to watch.,2023-03-27T23:22:55Z
$ZIM $Premium on ex divi puts, insane or rational?! M.M.s banking $$$,2023-03-27T23:15:07Z
$ZIM Lots of disagreements in here.,2023-03-27T22:55:38Z
$ZIM As we approach the ex-dividend date of April 3, you can still buy the stock and get your $6.40 dividend, minus potential taxes of 25%. So, I pray for your prosperity and happiness!,2023-03-27T22:05:26Z

$ZIM can we just solve this once and for all. The smart investor would have a shit ton of shares for the dividend and long term growth, AND buy puts OOTM expiring  next week.,2023-03-27T21:41:46Z
@midnight12 @Immortaltruth @mike325 @KingBocephus73  
Come on folks, just BLOCK (I am after this post) the fucktard short that he is.  He&#39;s just sowing disinformation to get the uneducated stupid idiots (who refuse to READ for themselves and learn) to sell thus helping him further in his quest.  He&#39;s selling short and if he can get you to sell $ZIM too - double bonus.

$ZIM 

The payment of a dividend via due bills is quite unlike a normal dividend payment.  Shares that are purchased after the record date but before the deferred ex-date (the due bill period) are traded with a due bill attached.  The chain of events that begins on the payment date works like this:  The dividend is first paid to the shareholder of record, then, on the due bill settlement date, which is commonly one trading day after the ex-date, the dividend is withdrawn from the account of the shareholder of record who sold the shares during the due bill period and is then paid to the shareholder who bought the shares during the due bill period.
      The dividend is paid to all shareholders of record first because that is the only information the company has on who is eligible for the dividend.  The due bills are then executed by the stock brokerages of the buyers and sellers during the due bill,2023-03-27T21:33:03Z

$ZIM If you bought Zim last week because you thought you‚Äôd be a billionaire this Friday then you‚Äôre in the wrong place. 

This is a solid company with outstanding books that happens to pay stellar dividends. 

The End 

This isn‚Äôt Ape - this isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúto the moon‚Äù gme - this isn‚Äôt a AMC short squeeze - it‚Äôs not a muln - nor bed bath beyond. 

Zim is for traders who actually look at fundamentals,2023-03-27T21:05:13Z

$ZIM  so what happens to everyone buying the stock between now and April 4th?  
 
You won&#39;t get the dividend but your shares will get chunked 25% on EX day.  
 
Seems like this is legalized fraud but we will see how it plays out I guess.  
 
Enjoy being forced to hold your shares while they go down for the next 2 weeks or forfeit the dividend.  
 
Normally you only have to hold the stock on recording day. Not for 2 weeks.  
 
The best play is to sell before EX day.

$ZIM now alpha loves zim. Lol  they change according to their positions.  https://seekingalpha.com/article/4590251-zim-12-percent-discount-to-cash-value?source=copy_to_clipboard,2023-03-27T20:49:48Z
@LoveWarren I got confused about this as well. I even asked $ZIM investor relations how it works but they refused to comment on anything except what was in the press release. 
 
I bought today one share of $ZIM at $22.0 to verify how it works. But I think it is supposed to work like this: 
$ZIM pays $6.40 to the stockholder on record date (March 24). But if that stockholder sells before the ex-div date of April 4th, that person is supposed to forward the dividend to you. 
 
I think here the seller&#39;s broker is supposed to send the dividend to your broker. (I don&#39;t think this requires the seller to agree to pass you the dividend) 
 
This whole process is called &quot;Due Bill&quot;. See https://ibkr.info/article/3043 for a short description 
 
There is also a 25% Israeli tax on this. One of the brokers will forward this, so you should only expect $4.80. 
 
This can get complicated if the same share exchanged hands many times. But in principle you are supposed to get the dividend,2023-03-27T20:39:29Z
$ZIM hello just need like 30 or so after divi. K thank you,2023-03-27T20:32:55Z
