$ZIM 

Fed backstopping all banks, likely to pause the hikes, providing liquidity again will change the future outlook of demand for container shipping 

BOD meeting of Zim today will be more optimistic about future then they were 3 hrs back and can allocate more dividend capital,2023-03-13T00:13:21Z

Fed has ended QT and now again providing liquidity to Banks.

Narrative changes very fast going forward.,2023-03-12T22:55:49Z
@kirkulr We have been waiting for the &quot;collapse&quot; to come since 2016, its not happening mate. 
The fair price of $ZIM calculating with -95% net income drop and a faire P/E of 15 would be $37. 
$ZIM is heavily undervalued  compared to its peers as its P/E ratio is still only around 1/7 of its competitors (who&#39;s stock price is constantly growing since December by the way). And its undervalued not because of performance but because of shorties. Literally they are the only reason that this is trading at $20 instead of minimum $40. (with Hapag Lloyds&#39; P/E of 3.1, $ZIM&#39;s price should be $151, just saying).,2023-03-12T22:39:17Z
$ZIM SVB Handled.  We should have an Epic Monday.,2023-03-12T22:34:17Z
$ZIM Also, please ignore the &quot;analysts&quot; and their bullshit. I looked into Zim&#39;s financials, carried capacity, dewry, freight rates etc all the way back until 2017, also compared it to its competitors (mainly Hapag LLoyds), and ZIM&#39;s fundamentals are super strong. There won&#39;t be any loss in FY23, and I expect strong results in FY24. By the end of FY24 ZIM will be one of the largest shipping companies with nearly half the carrying capacity of Maersk. So if you are brave enough, then sell premarket on Monday, and rebuy it intra day, if you are a long term player like me who is not brave enough for this (nor have the time) then hold it. By the end of the year this will go to at least $40.,2023-03-12T22:19:28Z
$ZIM This company is a hidden gem, but it will be destroyed on Monday probably, unless big earnings surprise (unlikely but possible). The reason for this is not the fundamentals or the company&#39;s performance, not even the highly probable temporary dividend cutback but 1 single thing: shorts. 
ZIM&#39;s short ratio is around 20%, and more than half of the daily sell volume in the past 3 days were shorts. Whatever happens on Monday, they will short it to the ground. Which also means they will have to cover. Cover 20%+ of the total outstanding shares. Well, good luck doing that without triggering a short squeeze.  
My projection is: -15% on Monday, -2% on Tuesday, green for the rest of the month, price recovering to $22 in 2 weeks max.,2023-03-12T22:13:34Z
$ZIM not trying to get thrown off by FUD but would the smart thing be to sell this on market open? This whole bank crash stuff is making me think it will be a slaughter house this week. I&#39;m in it for the dividend and it would be a gift to get it at a cheaper rate by DCA but not sure if it&#39;s smart to invest with so much corruption, b. s. and likely coming bail-ins etc. around the corner,2023-03-12T22:07:04Z
$ZIM don&#39;t underestimate the Israelis smartest people in the world.... somehow I think we will be OK.,2023-03-12T21:46:18Z
$ZIM who is zim‚Äôs closest competitor?,2023-03-12T21:24:20Z
$ZIM ... regardless of the amount of dividend... $SIVB has ruined the party. Zero net, net. = zero sum effect. Dividend of $5 and markets lose 5%. Risk aversion tells me ZIM will trade below $15 this week, regardless of dividend.,2023-03-12T21:06:16Z

I lost big money in past on this smooth brain‚Äôs - Stone Fox Capital ‚Äòs blackberry and Fitbit bullish articles.

He should refer to Starbulk and Maersk CEO who are running business and do not see cash burn at all in near future

I have puts just for hedge but I don‚Äôt think any one else knows how to run operations profitably in lower transportation rates environment.

Read the transcript of SBlK and CEO mention that how slow speed or fast speed makes a difference in dynamic performance pricing etc and when analyst asked will you drop below 286 Mn $ operating profits and not go or dividend, CEO says- I don‚Äôt see that happening.

Watch when Bond yields drop suddenly with banking crisis and Fed‚Äôs inflation hunt folds prematurely ,,2023-03-12T17:27:48Z

$ZIM I put all money to go short right before earnings. I am convinced there will be decent pullback around 20 %. There is just not another option. It will go down by any outcome. Guidance will suck. Divy will be cut down to save money ahead.,2023-03-12T13:07:24Z
