$ZIM if you want to hold the stock LT may behoove to buy some puts or sell some calls with an effective date after the 4th. Just hedges for any drop in the stock after the divvy.üòéüòéüòéü§ë but if they come out with a great news or something else after the Divi you will probably lose your hedge.,2023-03-24T04:36:55Z
$ZIM I hope everyone can hold 10,000 shares, and then receive a dividend of $10 annually after deducting the dividends,2023-03-24T04:30:17Z
$ZIM usually the stock price drops for the amount of the dividend and then some. Just beware. I don&#39;t know if it will happen this time or not.üòÄüòÄüòÄü§ë best to all,2023-03-24T04:27:57Z
$ZIM they say shareholders of record March 24th. But if you buy on the 24th sometimes they miss recording you. You will have to hold until close the business April 4th.üòéüòéüòéü§ë,2023-03-24T04:21:21Z

$ZIM Everyone needs to remember this is a &quot;special dividend&quot; so the ex-dividend date is after the pay date (4/4/23).  You will not get the dividend is you sell before 4/4/23.  See below:

$ZIM hold at least until I retired. :),2023-03-24T01:11:10Z
$ZIM so, what happens if you were to short shares after record date and don&#39;t cover until exdate or later...answer is the 6.40 div would be removed from account.  
Same reasoning, if you buy shares after record date and hold into exdate, you will receive the 6.40 div. 
I&#39;ll be buying back some if this dips tomorrow or Monday. GL,2023-03-23T23:39:19Z
$ZIM I guess nobody wants the dividend. Either that or people are mad about the 25% tax. Even with the tax it&#39;s still a  $4 freaking dividend.,2023-03-23T23:32:25Z

$ZIM For those thinking about this, here is what will happen. Good Luck Shorts. You are going to need it after 3/24 at 4 PM.

$ZIM Lots of misinformation being pumped. Read Due process people. I think etc, is not correct. Anyone that buys after 4:00 PM 3/24 will follow Due Process just like the seller. Very simple. Good luck to those who are shorting. Due Process finding you soon. Better close before 3/24 at 4 PM.,2023-03-23T20:59:32Z
$ZIM to  get  the  dividend you have to buy the stock in after market before   8pm....its  when  you  settle  bought today settles Friday.......buy  Friday  3/24  settles  Monday....your  out  of  luck,2023-03-23T20:54:48Z
Which stock is the best to invest? Compare $USA vs. $USB vs. $ZIM. https://srnk.us/go/4509308,2023-03-23T20:48:43Z
According to the original news report, $ZIM will &quot;pay a dividend April 3, 2023, to holders of ZIM ordinary shares as of March 24, 2023. Since the foregoing declared dividend amount per share constitutes more than 25% of the Company&#39;s ordinary share price on the declaration date (March 13, 2023), per the instructions of the NYSE, the ex-dividend date with respect to this dividend distribution will be April 4, 2023. Shareholders who wish to receive the dividend must hold their ZIM shares until the ex-dividend date.&quot; 
 
Therefore, I believe those that sell the shares between March 24 and April 4, 2023 WILL NOT receive the dividend. Also, those who buy the shares before April 4, 2023 will NOT receive the dividend. 
 
So I think $ZIM gets to keep the dividends for all the shares that are traded between March 24 and April 3. 
 
In other words, I believe $ZIM will take a big drop tomorrow.  
 
Don&#39;t take my word for it. Read the original announcement: https://investors.zim.com/news/news-details/2023/ZIM-Reports-Financial-Results-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-of-2022/default.aspx,2023-03-23T20:45:32Z
$ZIM Looks like some people are trying to short early. Spamming the board with garbage. Good luck clowns.,2023-03-23T20:27:27Z
My alerts for LARGE caps. I have timestamps + buy fills for everything What&#39;s my win rate?

I ONLY buy when Algos are tired of selling. How? I buy when &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; is low.
I don&#39;t make 100s of trades. I only buy when I get a confirmation. Ask me for the receipts. 

Next, I&#39;ll trade $ATVI + $CRWD + $SNOW + $ZIM + $NVAX,2023-03-23T20:26:48Z
$ZIM I am doing an experiment. The last three times that I thought I should have sold, but was iffy, I got burned. So, this time, I sold 70% of my stock, and locked in a terrific gain. So, the experiment is: 
 
a) Am I wise or foolish to hold the remaining 30%, preferably for at least a year? Maybe these dividends will make the stock pay for itself. 
 
b) Or maybe ZIM will go to $30+ before April 4, and I will rue selling the 70%. 
 
c) Or maybe I will be absolutely surprised with something unexpected. 
 
In any case, the experiment will be ongoing. I think this is a great company with a wonderful balance sheet, and the fact that, within two years, some people have made over 200% return due to dividends, is laudatory. I am happy for them. I hope to join them. 
 
God bless you all, although I hope the shorts decide to go elsewhere. May all of you--bulls and shorts--enjoy your lives, prosper, and be generous to others.,2023-03-23T20:26:22Z

$ZIM Zim is paying a $6.40 dividend April 4th (the stock is at $24 now). If you live in the USA, Israel withholder 25% as tax withholding. To some extent you can get this back as a tax credit when completing your USA income taxes but the process is convoluted and it is fairly likely you will not get credit for all of the taxes withheld (it depends on your situation, one factor seems to be if you pay over 25% tax rate for all your income maybe you will get it all back - it is complicated so maybe not...). 
 
Anyway Zim has come up with a process to try and have the withheld funds paid to you.  It is also fairly complicated.  It seems you have to complete this form  https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1654126/000117891322001220/exhibit_99-2.htm 
 
Some details are here 
 https://investors.zim.com/news/news-details/2023/ZIM-Updates-on-Withholding-Tax-Procedures-on-April-2023-Cash-Dividend/default.aspx 
 
Anyway, this whole process is a bother, it would be much better if they came up with a process that relied on your brokerage account itself. The way this works now, 1) you have to provide details to another party that creates a risk of that information &gt;,2023-03-23T19:15:23Z
