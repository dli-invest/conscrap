$ZIM is valued rather cheaply when comparing the Enterprise Value to EBITDA ratio to the industry average of 4.73. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/analyzer/stock/ZIM?view=fundamental-analysis&amp;key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-04-05T04:56:00Z
$ZIM This is obviously the news that drove the share price down today.  Although it is aimed at curbing freight costs, it ultimately will have little impact because it ignores the important role of all supply chain participants, including ports, marine terminals, truckers, railroads, and warehouse operators at fixing the supply chain. 
 
This bill will ultimately benefit, and be very bullish, for the more developed, technologically driven, publicly traded, and sophisticated shippers like $ZIM $GOGL $DAC and $SBLK who already comply with the tracking, reporting, and transparency that the bill requires.   
 
However, the bill will be a nightmare for the privately owned &quot;giants&quot; of the shipping industry such as Mediterranean Shipping Company, CMA-CGM, Ocean Network Express, and others (who control more than 40% of the market) and are not bound to the strict reporting and compliance standards as publicly listed companies.

Mostly references trucking (so weird - for past year we were told not enough trucks or drivers, now too many (?) due to weakening consumer demand from inflation). Might be partial reason why all shipping and transports went down. But lord knows these shipping companies mostly profitable with low PE. But market only gets excited over memes and Musk. Anyway still waiting on my dividend,2022-04-05T01:25:06Z
$ZIM don&#39;t forget that many traders use stop losses which could have been triggered today. I&#39;m still bullish and hold for the dividends. Heck I bought more ZIM, SBLK, GOGL today at their lows.,2022-04-05T01:22:06Z
$ZIM 
Did anybody received dividend?
And how much? Full $17?,2022-04-05T01:06:38Z
$ZIM I am just baffled and cannot figure out why all of the shipping stocks dropped between 5% - 8% in unison between 9:30 AM and 10:15 AM EST this morning and then just leveled out. 
 
It&#39;s like $25 Billion of market value was erased in 45 minutes, on no news, while the  rest of the market went up.  What the heck is going on here? 
 
Does anyone have any plausible explanation for this?
