No soft landing for ZIMs share price!!!

(Bloomberg) ‚ÄìFrench container line giant CMA CGM SA is seeing an across-the-board drop in shipping rates and a loosening of logistics bottlenecks in some regions as demand softens.

‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôve been seeing now for many weeks is a decrease of freight rates in almost all sectors,‚Äù Chief Executive Officer Rodolphe Saade said Friday in Algiers. ‚ÄúWe expect that decrease to continue. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll see a strong drop but rather a soft landing.‚Äù,2022-08-30T02:18:41Z

One-way leasing rates for standard containers, were in the range of $100-$300 before June 2021(see graph above). The rates picked up from July 2021 skyrocketing at $1470 in the month of July 2021 and peaking by September to reach $2792. The leasing rates then started to decline. This year in May, the leasing rates stood at $1277, plummeting to $1095 in June and further to $906 in the month of July.,2022-08-30T02:16:19Z

$ZIM Keep your eyes on the S &amp; P 500. That&#39;s the elephant in the room. As long as it&#39;s trending downward, ZIM will follow and go down, also.  I see the low $30 range.,2022-08-29T23:40:00Z

Just wanted to say , bags are heavier than yesterday and lighter than next week. . 

Bagging one bull a  tick.,2022-08-29T22:42:37Z
$ZIM we should see a bounce as shorts get 4.75 bucks out of their accounts in the next few days - but this has been brutal,2022-08-29T22:29:25Z
$ZIM Best thing to do is to average down.  Don&#39;t let the shorts escape without some pain.  You know this thing will run again on the next ER/divi and there will likely be a big fat juicy &#39;catch up&#39; divi at year end.,2022-08-29T21:58:28Z

$ZIM Private equity is sooooo starved for yield and deep value,  they&#39;re actively positioning to take over shipping sector operators like ZIM... ZIM is probably the most buyable shipping sector name with staying power... Their model is flexible and their structure is streamlined and efficient... I would not be surprised to see multiple PE shops positioning here...,2022-08-29T20:07:43Z
