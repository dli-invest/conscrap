$ZIM ... it has stabilized.  Please don&#39;t expect a dividend. The CEO told you so. Nevertheless, earnings will be awful. But we play by forward earnings.,2023-01-18T00:54:23Z
$ZIM Iâ€™m trying to understand what chain stores thinking?? Seeing record foot traffic and dwindling supply of goods yet paying 10x in air freight vs container shipping and filling consumer demandâ€¦ if I was target, Walmart Costco shareholder I would be demanding ceo and board resign immediately and 30-50% profits returned to shareholdersâ€¦ fu shorty pay me!! I stayed at a holiday inn express last night..,2023-01-18T00:39:21Z

$ZIM Numbers laid out well in this reddit post. I think his Q4 30% number is on the low side, but at least this bull is not bullshitting himself:

$ZIM As noted last week, max pain is $20 for Friday. 
 
This will be a good test of the predictive power of max pain for this stock. This is what I expect: Tues: 17-18; Wed: 18-19; Thurs: 19-20; Fri: just above or below 20 all day..,2023-01-17T20:50:28Z
$ZIM told ya fooled twice,2023-01-17T20:35:43Z
$ZIM Price action flat, bullish divergences, volatility flat, high short interest, huge dividends, positive cash flow, company making money hand over fist. What is not to like here? If it get shorted more, I will load up. Just took a nibble.,2023-01-17T20:29:43Z
$ZIM As I have mentioned. Shorties can weight their own risks. Will they be able to short this to $5?? Possibly!! The most they can make will be $12 a share if the price go down to 5 Bucks (which makes a company with 5billion in cash worth approximately 600 millions market cap ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£) if this share shoot up to $45. Who gonna pee in their pants? Shorties!!!! ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,2023-01-17T20:10:50Z
$ZIM they will be announcing their dividend payment soon, I predict it will be $8.90 per share and the stock will rally hard,2023-01-17T20:09:41Z
