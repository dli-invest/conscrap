$ZIM P/B ratio is irrelevant here because management is locked into expensive 3-5-7 year charter contracts and will be forced to operate at a loss if container rates drop another 20-30%,2022-09-25T20:42:19Z
$ZIM lots of TEU in new ships coming online this year and next gonna drag container rates down even further,2022-09-25T20:40:46Z
$ZIM dividend trap for tutes to dump on amateur retail bagholders. FV likely between 15-20. There&#39;s probably another $10 in dividends in the next 6 quarters before it gets eliminated + the fair value of the business,2022-09-25T20:38:58Z
$ZIM zim in the 20s is an absolute gift. Even with a quarter of this year&#39;s pay out in 2023 this is a dividend power house. Management needs to take advantage of this low price and buy back shares, even a 10 per cent buy back would put a stop to the shorting and start to move the price higher.   I would be fine with a 10 per cent dividend and a $75 dollar stock price. Thoughts?,2022-09-25T20:21:22Z
$ZIM So the shareprice is about halve of the value of the company. This is such a large discount 🙄🤷  https://www.investopedia.com/investing/using-price-to-book-ratio-evaluate-companies/

$ZIM on a relief rally this could have a hefty Green Day just due to how bad it is beaten.,2022-09-25T19:48:35Z
$ZIM In the past week shipping rates in several shipping sectors actually came in higher... 
- North America West coast to China/East Asia UP 7% 
- North America East coast to China/East Asia UP 8% 
- North America East coast to North Europe UP 7% 
- North Europe to North America East coast UP 1% 
- Europe to South America West Coast UP 2% 
It&#39;s a start and is very encouraging that rates may be bottoming. Current price is $4262/per container.,2022-09-25T18:10:42Z
$ZIM Container rates already down to $3k. Maybe only $1k to go. Getting close.,2022-09-25T17:14:15Z
Like many in this room, I&#39;ve been wondering why $ZIM stock price keeps sinking and sinking despite all fundamentals being strong and a healthy outlook for high yield dividends. One potential explanation is the &quot;subsidiary&quot; status of ZIM under Kenon Holdings Ltd. (KEN - NYSE holds about 20-25% of ZIM&#39;s stock, down from 29% in January 2022). ZIM&#39;s historic earnings prompted KEN to sell off millions in shares at the peak and then declare a major dividend for its shareholders on ZIM&#39;s results. Another major shareholder DANAOS did the same thing. This flooded the market and the shorts moved in. I can&#39;t calculate the net effect but it appears it&#39;s all been negative. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KEN/community/,2022-09-25T15:57:00Z

$ZIM Just hold your investment forever you cant lose doing that if your young and if your old just give in to short-sellers.,2022-09-25T14:11:04Z
Don&#39;t miss this opportunity! $ZIM enters a Downtrend because Momentum Indicator dropped below the 0 level on August 19, 2022. View odds for this and other indicators: https://srnk.us/go/4018687,2022-09-25T13:26:14Z
$ZIM  It would be down right irresponsible of the Board of this company to not authorize at least $250 Million stock buyback. I think we get a double in price if they do that.,2022-09-25T13:11:12Z
$ZIM nobody should tell bag holder, they just won&#39;t listen,2022-09-25T11:54:35Z
$CLX $ZIM The worst investors are always the ones who have something to lose. If you want to be good at investing, put yourself in a position to win every time.
