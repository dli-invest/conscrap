$ZIM&#39;s low PEG Ratio, which compensates the PE for growth, indicates a rather cheap valuation. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/ZIM/fundamental-analysis?key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-06-08T02:23:00Z
$ZIM what to make of this. One day shipping rates are nuts, the next day collapsing. Is it worth betting against a stock w 1.4 pe and market cap less than revenue w crazy dividend, even if shipping rates come back to earth. Worth holding and collecting dividend?

Shanghai Port is benefiting from a gradual recovery in exports after a two-month citywide lockdown, as rising demand for ocean transport pushes up freight prices. 
 
Though the world’s largest container port is not yet back to its pre-lockdown handling capacity, most major shipping lines have made plans to return to the dozens of harbours along Shanghai’s 200-kilometre coast, looking to secure more orders from exporters getting back on their feet. 
 
Ocean freight rates have increased in the last few days, according to a weekly index compiled by the Shanghai Shipping Exchange. On June 2, the index hit 4,208.01, 0.8 per cent higher than a week earlier.
