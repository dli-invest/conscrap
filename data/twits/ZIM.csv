$ZIM Takeaways fromCFO call,2022-04-15T23:16:51Z
$ZIM it doesn‚Äôt matter what you paid for your shares. The dividend will be the same. She is about right in the middle of the high and low for the past 12 months and the PE is ridiculously low. Proceed with caution but IMO proceed.,2022-04-15T20:29:33Z
