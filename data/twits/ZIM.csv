$ZIM Based on this info, where do you guys see the stock going? On paper, it seems the company itself is still amazing, while the stock itself isn&#39;t going to be worth toilet paper soon. Like there&#39;s a disconnect, between fantasy land market gambling and how real world businesses handle the day to day. I&#39;m concerned my shares are about to keep plummeting, even while the company they represent retain amazing future potential. The company outlook is bullish, the stock is bearish, you know? I don&#39;t like this feeling. Any thoughts? Any price guesses for the next two quarters?,2023-04-06T01:48:13Z
$JEPI $RYLD $ZIM Stocks are suppose to drop by the amount of the dividend because the value is the company dropped by that much. It‚Äôs not tanking, it‚Äôs a market adjustment.,2023-04-06T01:16:46Z
$ZIM Anything under $20 is free money,2023-04-06T01:04:16Z
$ZIM  this stock has been on its way to a penny stock for a while. $6.40 div looks great, then you get $4.00. And stock value drops $7.00. Put your money in $JEPI  or $RYLD. Screw this trash,2023-04-06T00:09:39Z
$ZIM I bought 19 dollar calls yesterday. why did it drop so violently at open today? is it because of dividend?,2023-04-05T23:59:00Z
$ZIM 
Haven‚Äôt gotten the dividend from E*trade yet.,2023-04-05T23:25:29Z
$ZIM $JEPI  I want to buy some zim for that ridiculous divi. But to be honest the tax thing with it has me way to confused. Lol,2023-04-05T23:07:24Z
@spiritchild $zim same here, bought at $17.43,2023-04-05T22:55:48Z
@mds18 that is what was expected to happen with this dividend...

Ideally (best case scenario) you would have purchased $ZIM sometime from Dec to Jan when it was $17.01ish up to 17.19ish, held it from January to now (if you&#39;re a dividend investor), collect your dividends, and not be bothered at all by the fact that the current share price on the ex-dividend date for this dividend would be reduced by the the 6.40 dividend amount.  This would bring you back down close to your entry point and a little richer with your added dividends.
Now you have the opportunity to start the cycle again and buy more shares.

OR

You could have bought in 17s/16s Dec/Jan and taken all profits when it hit 25 at the end of Feb, not hold after Feb keep day trading/ swing trading up to ex-dividend date and be out by EOD before ex-dividend date adjustment.

$ZIM if you are investing. You have a sum of cash, dont make my mistakes when i began with stocks and buy for all your money at once :p Split this monthly sum for buys each day and buy only when its red, because hitting bottom is mostly luck.,2023-04-05T22:26:52Z
$ZIM I had no idea that the would foreign tax withhold. Will I ever see the 2k they kept? Lol,2023-04-05T22:19:52Z
$ZIM Cost of borrow went from 20 to 78% today. Shorting this stock at this price level and high interest is plain stupid. Next week back to 19 dollars.,2023-04-05T22:08:46Z
$ZIM 

It bounced off that 17.40 fib but I wanna buy at 17.20 and stop out at 16.23 if the low breaks. My plan, but it could‚Äôve finished the correction today ready to go into wave 3. I‚Äôd expect a gap up tomorrow to validate a wave 3 view. 

Neutral zone,2023-04-05T22:03:39Z
$ZIM isn&#39;t this supposed to squeeze? I kept hearing the shorts were screwed.. figured this would be going upwards even after the dividend?,2023-04-05T21:37:04Z
$ZIM question: so will the share price go down with every dividend paid out? If so what can stop that?,2023-04-05T21:30:42Z
$ZIM Did a lot of buying today. Thank you!,2023-04-05T21:29:25Z
$ZIM I&#39;d like to thank the shorts who were kind ( =dumb) enough to pay my Divi!

ü§ó Hugs.,2023-04-05T21:27:28Z
$ZIM No Thank you for your contribution, just like No thank you to your Govt who send annual 3B with Capital B donations since 1947!,2023-04-05T21:20:42Z
$ZIM : Sold my short position for a small loss on this. 

I&#39;ll admit defeat.  Establishing a long position to make up the losses 

ZIM had stronger Kung-Fu than I thought.,2023-04-05T20:57:13Z
$ZIM Did anyone here try to get some of the Israeli withholding tax back?,2023-04-05T20:51:20Z
$ZIM long term investment, I‚Äôm sitting back collecting my dividends and reinvesting üòé,2023-04-05T20:40:50Z

$ZIM Anyone using E*Trade get their dividend yet? I‚Äôm still waiting.,2023-04-05T20:29:00Z
$ZIM Hold  onto  your  short  position for at least 5 years. üò± See what will happen. I will hold for 20+ years.üòÇ Just pay the occasional dividend and pay the borrowing fee‚Ä¶ü§£,2023-04-05T20:21:58Z
$ZIM Sucks for those that got reinvested yesterday instead of today.  I guess all the shorts that covered before the ex-date all jumped back in today.,2023-04-05T20:15:14Z
