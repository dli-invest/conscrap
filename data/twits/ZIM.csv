$ZIM question on dividend payouts.  Does the Isreali govt. withhold taxes on the dividends or is their a tax treaty?  Not much info I could find..,2023-01-30T20:33:13Z

$ZIM large spike of shorts came in at 18.93.  around 10k shares.   Not sure if will make difference.  But if it pushes .10 higher now. Might trigger stop loss.,2023-01-30T18:04:38Z
