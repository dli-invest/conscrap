$ZIM  nice try.

1. US taxpayers get their 25% back thanks to US - Israel ( and many other countries) tax agreements.

3. You&#39;ll pay US capital gains tax ANYWAY...

Last, with your FUD &quot;logic&quot;: why invest if you pay taxes ? 

Me ? I am perfectly fine paying tax on gains.,2023-03-26T04:08:49Z

$ZIM seems like a nice 25% tax payment off the bat to the Israel government.  Than in USA if in regular account will get taxes as well.  Nice dividend amount, but with paying taxes to both places.  Is it worth it?,2023-03-25T23:46:36Z
With a price book ratio of 0.47, $ZIM is valued rather cheaply. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/ZIM/fundamental-analysis?key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2023-03-25T23:36:00Z

This is no exaggeration a couple years back MYO was a 120m market cap and the company was twice as small. It is currently trading around a 12m market cap and they are getting approved by more countries and probably the USA soon. International revs and already at all time highs and pipeline is also at highs which is an indicator of possible revenues in the future. With the USA approval it could make more revs then mkt cap at the very least. This is one of the safest easiest swings in the market.   🚨 MYO 🚨,2023-03-25T22:34:25Z

My alerts for LARGE caps. I have timestamps + buy fills for everything What&#39;s my win rate?

I ONLY buy when Algos are tired of selling. How? I buy when &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; is low.
I don&#39;t make 100s of trades. I only buy when I get a confirmation. Ask me for the receipts. 

Next, I&#39;ll trade $ATVI + $CRWD + $SNOW + $ZIM + $NVAX,2023-03-25T20:26:46Z

$ZIM so according to the due bill process a buyer any point from the record date to the ex date would receive the dividend from the record holder. So why wouldn&#39;t someone just by right before the ex date like normal. At least that how I understood what I read,2023-03-25T19:03:54Z

$ZIM not I heard the Aliens get paid first provided no more balloons until the EX Date!!!,2023-03-25T07:33:28Z
@Unwantedconvo @Dontlook001 I moved a chunk to $ZIM at peak I was 285k shares. Now down to 150k which frankly I’m only keeping because my tax bill is already way too high to sell more!  I mean this goes for 20/share anytime they want to sell. That’s just simple math of 4x peak sales on oral which is frankly below market.  Previously I was happy they didn’t do it but now I have no confidence in execution and no desire to wait 4 more years.,2023-03-25T06:55:46Z
