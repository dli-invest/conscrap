$ZIM well I know others have made their predictions and I suppose the BOD can change their mind at any time. (I don‚Äôt see that happening). So cross referencing Q1-Q3 22 along side Q1-Q4 21 I believe I have gotten our number. I estimated a conservative 1 billion net for Q4 22. First 3 quarters we already were at net 4.2 B. (We did 4.65 net for all of 2021 btw). If my 1 B is on par with what we did our 22 annual net will be 5.2 B. The board paid out 30% Divi in 22 so thus far they have paid out $10.55 in dividends. 50% of net would be 2.6 B right on track with where it was in 2021. Complete annual dividend is 21 was $21.50 per share. That‚Äôs at 120,930,232 shares outstanding though. I am currently only seeing ZIM with approximately 120,050,000 shares outstanding (multiple sources). Also if you take Q3 22 dividend they only paid out 120,000,000 shares. This is all approximately of course. I know ZIM had a share buy back so it appears outstanding shares have dropped. So‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.,2023-02-09T00:23:02Z
