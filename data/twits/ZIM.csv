$ZIM I came across this today. Multiple sites say the dividend yield is almost 100% on this stock. How can this be possible? What am I missing? Everyone would be in this stock if it were that easy.,2022-10-31T02:16:34Z

$ZIM One of the best ways to educate yourself on the market is through penny stocks. You may lose a few bucks here  but it&#39;s a great education. Here&#39;s one for the books: A rise in volume or share price without documented revenue or some increase in assets of a company is known as DAY TRADING. Don&#39;t get caught up in this. Day trading is based on forecasting investor emotions and capitalizing on them.,2022-10-30T13:08:47Z
$ZIM Major share price considerations are based on actual documented information from the corporation (not analysts) ie... Revenue, assests, signed contracts, the economy, etc.... Minor considerations consist of future predictions, patents, word of  agreements between businesses etc...Don&#39;t be fooled by what people think. Need documentation.,2022-10-30T12:49:34Z
$ZIM The DOW finished out at 32861. That&#39;s way over blown. Work of the Elites. Good for ZIM buyers. If the DOW crashes there will be another dive to under $23/share I would think. I am broke at this point. I will not spend the Christmas money lol. Family first. I will bite my lip on this one.,2022-10-30T12:29:46Z

When comparing the current price to the book value of $ZIM, it is valued rather cheaply. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/analyzer/stock/ZIM?view=fundamental-analysis&amp;key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-10-29T23:15:00Z
$ZIM   Plan &quot;A&quot; got em 1M+ short shares covered last week. Short interest is currently 13.5M shares to cover in 13 trading days because they know, and we know it too. that earnings will be &gt;$9/sh and div will be &gt;$3/sh.  Any news of freight rates showing signs of stabilizing would be a very powerful catalyst, doubling ZIM PPS or more.,2022-10-29T23:04:41Z
$ZIM The play book that worked last week of hitting the bid hard in the morning and then accumulating on the bid at lower prices will NOT work come Monday thru Nov 16th. When that gets figured out, plan B for shorts covering will be panic buying. That usually leads to MoMo (Momentum traders) buyers coming in, which ends up as my favorite thing of all, being short squeeze.,2022-10-29T22:40:16Z

$ZIM This is from the Seeking Alpha article below: 
 
These are quotes from the article: &quot;We are of the opinion that current levels offer investors with an extremely attractive risk/ reward ratio, given the potentially rich dividend payout of $10.81 by FQ4&#39;22.&quot;  
  
&quot;Nonetheless, consensus estimates remain bullish about ZIM&#39;s prospects, given their price target of $55.00 and a 90.97% upside from current prices.&quot;  
  
I&#39;d love to know what others think about these projections.,2022-10-29T00:29:59Z
