Compared to an average Enterprise Value to EBITDA ratio of 2.97, $ZIM is valued rather cheaply. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/ZIM/fundamental-analysis?key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2023-03-11T05:14:00Z

$ZIM 

Looking at Maersk YoY revenue in Dec Qtr they had -4% YoY reported.

Here street is pricing step down from 3.7 to 2.09 Bn- 45% down YoY

I know that contract mix  , route , scale and rates are different etc but still 
Wall Street could be caught completely off guard with ZIM reporting much higher than $2.09 Bn as one Industry player reporting -4% and another expected to report -45%, does not seem good at face of it.,2023-03-11T00:50:09Z
$ZIM The word &quot;panic&quot; is widely misused. &quot;People fled in panic from the burning building.&quot; This is incorrect, because people have good reason to fear harm in a fire.  
 
The idea of panic properly refers to a groundless (usually contagious) fear, similar to the spontaneous terror that was aroused in people who heard the god Pan play his pipes. 
 
If you replace Pan by &quot;analyst&quot; you can see how useful the word is when discussing the behaviour of ZIM stock owners. This is one part of the definition from the OED: 
 
&quot;2. a.B.2.a (= panic fear, terror, etc.; see A. 1): A sudden and excessive feeling of alarm or fear, usually affecting a body of persons, originating in some real or supposed danger vaguely apprehended, and leading to extravagant or injudicious efforts to secure safety.,2023-03-11T00:04:53Z
$ZIM - Earnings call this week. TA alert: ZIM Integrated price pattern may cross Stalled Pattern line, reversion expected,2023-03-10T23:36:33Z
$ZIM I sold everything last week. Every stock. I bought some 22.50 calls.  Then today bought some 20 calls. Great deal for them.  Monday I buy into shares after announcement. Really was shock I&#39;d be able to buy in under 20. But it saved me 2 bucks a share selling at 21.50. Now I can buy in cheaper. I couldnt stay in any stock with the bloodbath going on..lol  but looks like evrything has bottomed out. as long as they do a decent divy. It&#39;ll be back to 25. If they panick from the market. Andngo low. Stock will stay around 20 for a while. It seriously does feel like a Texas hold em match Like one guy said..lol  but I&#39;m all in for the ride Monday morning.,2023-03-10T22:43:49Z

$ZIM Here&#39;s an analogy that explains why the stock price drop does not bother me at all. Imagine I own a house, and some agent comes around and offers to buy it for $20. I politely decline. He then shows me articles written by his friends that claim the house is worth no more than that. I am worried, so to reassure myself, I walk down into the basement to check that my chest of money still has $30 in it. Then I go out to the yard to check on my hens that lay golden eggs. They are still laying a few, although not as many as last year. I am hoping for at $4 next year and every year from them. I ask myself, would I give away the house, the treasure chest and all my hens all for the sake of $19 in hand today?,2023-03-10T22:00:07Z
$ZIM Hello from Israel. Insiders info. 
Just one week ago ZIM thought about 50% from profit. Today, in the morning, after Bloody week on WS, they decided to pay 30% - $5.5-6. 
 
Well. I can understand. They don&#39;t want to pay $8-10 if price will be $17-20. Like example $19 - $9 = $10 after Divs 
We all thought and saw from $17 to $25, and waited for $30+ before ER. But, but market and Wall Street said ha ha. 
 
Long. I mean Forever. I&#39;m not playing here, Buy and forget.  
Some years will be $0 divs, some years $20. At the end it will be free money for everyone, and I&#39;m sure next 10y average- 20-30% in divs. Go and find even 10%.

$ZIM 

Liking the company and setup here. I was trying to buy shares even for 1000 shares bid had to be changed twice or thrice

Maersk CEO was bullish on container market.

Looked at Analystâ€™stars and their ratings.

JP Morgan guy is a solid guy, others are not so successful analyst 

On top of that CEO May like to burn the shorts by giving higher than expected annual dividend and destroy short thesis.

Buying stock with puts as hedge ( you never know if another bank goes down on Monday just in case),2023-03-10T19:41:34Z
