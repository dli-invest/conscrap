$ZIM    I&#39;ve been holding and adding shares for a long time. When I get my div, I wait for 20-25 days after div date to Re-invest back in at a lower share price. So far I&#39;ve got 2488 shares ü•≥,2023-03-23T01:48:56Z
$ZIM the guidance was calculated on depressed BDI calc&#39;s it is up 230% so we will BEAT again probaqbly by 200% or so the boss has said..shalom shorties!****,2023-03-23T00:42:39Z
$ZIM this **special** dividend is targeted so that shorts DO NOT PROFIT by a Companies success .Shorts will PAY CASH on 3/24 but stock  price will not reflect the dividend until 4/4 ...this coupled w the &#39;true-up&#39; really puts them to the mat!! its an ingenius way to carve out a CASH PAYMENT to all shorts of record on 3/24 if they dont know they will findout the HARDWAY...I&#39;m so excited I can barely stand it!!!,2023-03-23T00:40:36Z
$ZIM increase in shipping rates by 230% means we will CRUSH expectations by big numbers in Q1 ...I know it cuz we are shipping as fast as our updateded logistics will aquire...we have 68% backlog on all docks in every country :),2023-03-23T00:27:00Z

$ZIM @Guptastocks 

Agree with you‚Ä¶the shares bought by Gupta on March 23 would not be traceable because they would not settle by record date.  Gupta bought these shares from ABC and sells before ex div date.  Gupta gets no div.

XYZ buys these shares from Gupta after March 25th and ABC is on record owning those shares on March 24th.  The shares that ABC owned on March 22nd are marked with ‚ÄúDue Bill Tracking‚Äù.

XYZ receives div on April 4th via the shares from ABC via Due Bill Process.,2023-03-22T23:49:17Z
$ZIM A sincere question: because we have to hold the stock from March 24 to April 4 to receive the dividend, what is likely to happen to the price of ZIM during this holding period; for example, where will the price be on, say, March 31? 
 
Also, please read the attachment.,2023-03-22T23:40:17Z
$ZIM indeed 30 usd at least on April‚Ä¶..üöÄ,2023-03-22T23:31:18Z
$ZIM the shorts will be OUT OF POCKET 3/24 yet the price wont reflect dividend unti 4/4 the are on the HOOK for CASH out of pocket plus the special TRUE-UP dividend they are soooo fukd,2023-03-22T23:30:53Z
$ZIM this is an ingenius way of forcing shorts to put up money out of pocket on march 24 however the stock will not open w the 6.40 deduct until 4/4 a week and a half longer interest PLUS money out of pocket will crush them!,oh and the &#39;true-up div as well...this is gonna get wild ladies and gents!!,2023-03-22T23:22:03Z
@Theoneyardstreet $ZIM 

Agreed with above .

My question is different.

Shareholder Guptastocks buys ZIM shares on March 23 and March 24 and holds it beyond March 25th.

These shares are not eligible for dividend given these will not settle by record date March 24th.

On Mar 26- Guptastocks sell those shares in market and market sells these shares to a  buyer XYZ assuming that he will get dividend..

How would XYZ identify which share has dividend attached to it or not?,2023-03-22T22:39:12Z
$ZIM My understanding is the div arrives late to Shareholder B but still arrives via ‚ÄúDue Bill Tracking‚Äù from Shareholder A.

That‚Äôs my understanding at least.,2023-03-22T22:33:31Z
$ZIM @Guptastocks 

Check it out:

https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/due-bill-process/

- ZIM owes all shares the dividend
- Shareholder A owns shares on March 22nd and holds until March 25th
- ZIM has Shareholder A on record and thus has to pay the dividend to Shareholder A by ex div date April 4th 
- Shareholder B buys all Shareholder A‚Äôs shares on March 25th
- These shares are tagged with ‚ÄúDue Bill Tracking‚Äù
- Shareholder B holds until ex div date April 4th and is still entitled to the dividend
- The mechanism of the dividend flows through Shareholder A (because they were on record by 24th) but eventually arrives at Shareholder B (because they held before and after ex div date) and this mechanism is ‚ÄúThe Due Bill Process‚Äù,2023-03-22T22:28:59Z

With a price book ratio of 0.49, $ZIM is valued rather cheaply. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/ZIM/fundamental-analysis?key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2023-03-22T22:23:00Z
$ZIM DaisyHH LMAO... Comes here posting tons of &quot;watch out for pumpers&quot; comments while the stock is moving up... Either because you&#39;re just a short basher who doesn&#39;t know when to cover, or just a sour grape.  Just because someone is long does not make them a pumper.  Get a life.  Now one believes you&#39;re trying to warn anyone with your dozens of pumper-bashing posts.,2023-03-22T22:15:49Z
@SeeminglyOrdinaryPodcast $ZIM 

I think a large portion of these remaining short shares as of today are kind of outstanding short shares against a big long position by a set of short long hedge funds.

Stand-alone short funds have covered already to a large extent or may be they are fine paying special dividend instead of covering beyond 24-25 range.

It‚Äôs a fundamental undervaluation story first and foremost.,2023-03-22T22:05:47Z
$ZIM watch out all the pumper in here, so many people get burned by ZIM, don‚Äôt listen to PUMPER, check their previous post, make your own decision.,2023-03-22T22:02:50Z
@Theoneyardstreet $ZIM 

How does one identify that share being purchased by one post record date has a special dividend attached to it.

If I buy fresh set of shares tomorrow and on Friday, those shares won‚Äôt have special dividend and I can sell those shares next week, buyers won‚Äôt get any dividend because I did not have any.

It works well when selling and buying stock holder like institutions are transacting directly .,2023-03-22T21:58:56Z
