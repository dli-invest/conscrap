$ZIM The company&#39;s financials look healthy to me, but the economy in general looks bearish. So, is a stock price above $30 in June reasonable?,2023-03-20T01:45:42Z
$ZIM how many believe this will see 30, like some have been boosting about. personally, i would like to see at least 27.,2023-03-20T00:54:26Z

$ZIM dividend soon https://youtu.be/yN0Jld6Womw,2023-03-19T21:17:26Z
$ZIM over the past 5 years, ZIM&#39;s ROIC (return on invested capital) is 36% median return. Expectations is for 10% for companies, so a very nice performance. The FCF ( free cash flow) growth is an outstanding 95%. Net profit margin is 42.7%, their sector median is 6.5% which is incredible pricing power. For the amount of debt they carry it is only 1.8 years to repay it.

ZIM is a powerhouse overloaded with cash. Great long-term investment that will continue to provide benefits for years to come regardless of any troubled waters.,2023-03-19T20:37:03Z
My alerts for LARGE caps. I have timestamps + buy fills for everything What&#39;s my win rate?

I ONLY buy when Algos are tired of selling. How? I buy when &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; is low.
I don&#39;t make 100s of trades. I only buy when I get a confirmation. Ask me for the receipts. 

Next, I&#39;ll trade $ATVI + $CRWD + $SNOW + $ZIM + $NVAX,2023-03-19T20:26:58Z

$ZIM,2023-03-19T17:19:25Z
$ZIM how does this make sense. If you own it before March 24 you revive the payment on April 3rd, but the ex date is April 4th ?,2023-03-19T15:58:43Z
$ZIM someone explain the dividend  it says you have to be a shareholder by March 24th which means 23rd should be the ex date. But I‚Äôm reading ex date is April 4th AFTER the payout ? Which one is it ?,2023-03-19T15:54:51Z
$ZIM I have 10,000 shares. I‚Äôll be getting $64,000 in dividend payments. That will be reinvested thru DRIP. I can‚Äôt be the only one investing huge dividends into buying back more shares. I think we see $32 even after the huge dividend payment.,2023-03-19T15:49:58Z
$ZIM Your telling me they will pay a $6.4 dividend for each ordinary share owned by 3/24?  

That‚Äôs an absurd dividend.  Is this going to skyrocket? 

What am I missing here?,2023-03-19T14:19:46Z

$ZIM the ex dividend date of April 4 seems so unlogical. All the previous times the ex dividend date was one day before the record date. So to me it seems March 23 would be the ex date. That makes there is very little time for shorts to buy back. Monday and Tuesday could give interesting developments. I guess Wednesday all action will be done and will be more quiet.,2023-03-19T11:34:35Z
$ZIM Maersk&#39;s ships are 6 times the size of ZIM&#39;s, then calculate the market value by dividing Maersk&#39;s market value by 6, which results in $46.895 B. 
The current market value of ZIN is only 2.948B, which means there is still a lot of room for ZIM to rise.,2023-03-19T09:36:01Z

$ZIM Next week we should see it breaking the resistance and creating a new support
The question would be why we have to sell it,2023-03-19T01:37:34Z
$ZIM 

Credit Suisse and banks going down under, Bond yields going lower - What does it mean?

1. Housing and other goods demand picks up to a normal level - More shipping reqd.
2. Interest on leasing the ships goes down

Both tailwinds for ZIM shipping prices for a cash burn of $2 Bn over next two years otherwise.,2023-03-18T21:40:22Z
$ZIM I‚Äôm long Zim. Is it a good idea to do a cover call on Apr 3- $30 or 35 strike price expires May 5 to collect extra premium?,2023-03-18T20:50:42Z
$ZIM 100% agree.  This doesn‚Äôt even need a short squeeze.  Did you see their balance sheet?  Rev $12.56B?  Net income $4.63B?  Literally show me a balance sheet this good:
