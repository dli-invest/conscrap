$ZIM donâ€™t forget to email Glickman.Eli@zim.com or holzman.Elana@zim.com and ask why not share buyback,  why so much insider selling and how they plan to lift the share price even though every cash dividend reduces the share price by more then the dividend?,2022-12-06T19:04:41Z
$ZIM letâ€™s see if management buys shares in their own company with the dividend.  Management owns 30 percent and if I see no inside buying a m done with this company until it hits 8-10 dollars.  Management needs to stop being so douche.,2022-12-06T18:59:13Z

$ZIM the million dollar question is do existing shareholders want to buy more ZIM shares?  Itâ€™s a tough one as whoâ€™s going to buy after the shareholders use there dividend to purchase more ZIM shares.  This companyâ€™s dividend is going to hurt the share price going forward unless they change the structure of the dividend from cash too drip.   Really management is hurting the share price more then even the recession.  Hard to have any real believe in management that just unloaded millions of shares after getting the biggest dividend in history.  If ZIM wants to bring inveStors back into the stock they need to put there money where there mount is and start purchasing shares. Eli has made more then 50 million in share sales and dividends from ZIM stock .,2022-12-06T17:01:40Z
