$ZIM  this is my only turd in the septic tank that isn&#39;t floating. What gives?,2022-11-30T20:16:44Z
$ZIM .. this is how China re-opening will affect ZIM&#39;s income positively. With re-opening, productivity will resume. Thus, more goods are to be manufactured, produced, and shipped globally. However, there are few ships to handle such productivity. Shipping rates will rise again due to the scarcity of ships.,2022-11-30T20:14:02Z
