$ZIM So it is very clear how much confidence it can give when it comes to investing in it because of its robustness. However, any investment has its risks. Last week, it outperformed 95% of companies with a +10% rise in the midst of a slump (which I think is extraordinary).  
In conclusion, we await its financial results in May and if they are positive, the continuation of high prices and some volume would all point to Bullish. Let&#39;s hope for the best case scenario.

$ZIM All indications are that the company will continue to perform well.   
I will explain: We are in a period very similar to stagflation, i.e. crisis + inflation. That is why the best stocks tend to be commodities (raw materials and transport), of course technology has fallen quite a lot because they are intangible assets and these give only long term benefits. So, with the rise in freight rates, shipping lines continue to increase their revenues, due to 1. the collapse of the ports and the high demand for shipping containers and 2. the Ukrainian war that &#39;favours&#39; the rise in the price of raw materials (inflation). In addition, it should be noted that the port of Shanghai is gradually improving and there will be work to smooth out the bottlenecks. ZIM is a company that is more than half a century old, with fairly healthy accounts and a good ratio to meet its debt repayments.,2022-05-13T15:47:18Z
