$SFL Any thoughts on what differentiates this company from $ZIM or $DAC ? Looking to get into a global shipping company - I see sustained tailwinds longterm and fancy a nice consistent dividend - but I&#39;m curious which of these would be considered a market leader? Serious responses only. Thanks.,2022-09-22T04:37:25Z

$ZIM I don’t buy for the short term. Zims already paid me more in divvies than I invested. Still the bear case seems to be 3 things going perfectly.  
 
1. container shipping falling 75%. This could happen for sure. Will at some point  
 
2. Zim management making no maneuvers to hedge drops in container prices. Takes no advantage of their niche market. Does nothing but what they dod during 218-2019 
 
3. Zim management squanders 4 billion. This seems the least likely to me. If a 1 billion dollar company wins a 4 bn anti-trust case that money doesn’t disappear. It’ll be given to shareholders, expand revenue, remove debt.  
 
shorts need all 3 t happen to justify this price or lower. I just doubt it with this company and management,2022-09-22T02:14:52Z

$ZIM  Let&#39;s take a look at ZIM&#39;s current analyst ratings based on price targets...  Looks like they have 5 Buy ratings right now... 
 
17 Jun 22 JPM upgraded to Hold with $53 PT... This is now a Buy rating based on their price target.... 
 
1 Jul 22 BOA downgraded to Sell with $40 PT... This is now a Buy rating based on their price target.... 
 
20 Jul 22 Jeffereis initiated at Hold with $55 PT... This is now a Buy rating based on their price target.... 
 
19 Aug 22 Barclays maintained at Hold with $63 PT... This is now a Buy rating based on their price target.... 
 
22 Aug 22 Citigroup downgraded at Hold with $52 PT... This is now a Buy rating based on their price target.... 
 
Sure looks to me like ZIM has 5 Buy ratings here... 6 if you count Goldmans laughable $30 outlier they puked out today....,2022-09-22T01:20:59Z
$ZIM People keep buying fake dips and talking about valuations and blaming the market. That&#39;s just gross..,2022-09-22T01:18:16Z
$ZIM  There are numerous metrics that clearly demonstrate how deeeeeply undervalued ZIM is here... But to me the most glaring is that it&#39;s trading for less than cash on hand... ZIM has become the most obvious example of how deeeeeply inefficient stock market price valuation is over the short term...,2022-09-22T01:09:16Z
$ZIM my average is just under 40. Waiting for a confirmation to start adding again, holding till 2024. Collecting divis,2022-09-22T01:06:53Z
$ZIM Goldman Sachs has its eye on this baby.,2022-09-22T01:06:08Z
$ZIM  ZIM here represents one of the best investing opportunities available to public investors in decades... Yes, that&#39;s right...  There has been outright capitulation in these shares (without regard for fundamentals) over the last several weeks to the point where ZIM has become one of the best take-private candidates in the market right now...  How much is ZIM worth to a private equity shop right now (based on their average 5 year holding period)... At least $60 per share...,2022-09-22T01:04:03Z
$ZIM  The reality in the container shipping world is that spot rates continue to follow a well-forecasted, gradual and predictable glide-path lower, while contract rates  move sideways to higher based on the reality that container ship availability will actually contract moving into 2023 because of unprecedented levels of delayed scrapping that occurred during 2021... I&#39;d say about 2% to 4% of the fleet is over-due for scrapping when factoring ESG considerations... While that doesn&#39;t sound like much it only takes a 1% shortage to send rates skyrocketing higher... That&#39;s how sensitive shipping rates are to supply/demand imbalances due mainly to the long lead times for new ship supply... ... The convergence of these factors along with inflation will cause rates to stabilize and form a new base run rate much higher than pre-pandemic levels...  Deeeeeeeeeply undervalued... Very bullish...,2022-09-22T01:02:52Z
$ZIM  Goldman bailed out the shorts today... Don&#39;t expect their blatant market manipulation to last long... Tomorrow is a new day...  The bottom line here is that real-world market conditions on the ground (very positive) and fundamentals (even better) will ultimately determine ZIM&#39;s valuation when the dust settles and reality begins to matter more than irrational market sentiment and momentum... One thing is for certain here... When ZIM bounces, the bounce will be epic, and the remaining shorts will get crushed...,2022-09-22T01:02:19Z
$ZIM I think if this can maintain annually 7 to 8 billion dollars in revenue for the next three years and pay approximately 5.5 dollars per share in dividends yearly, it would be a good buying opportunity. I am waiting for $22 to compensate for the unknown falling demand risk.,2022-09-22T00:30:29Z
