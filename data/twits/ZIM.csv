$ZIM spot rate is balanced out ..,2022-12-28T04:08:08Z
My alerts for LARGE caps. I have timestamps + buy fills for everything What&#39;s my win rate?

I ONLY buy when Algos are tired of selling. How? I buy when &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; is low.

It&#39;s a simple strategy. Learn what &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; by Algos.

I don&#39;t make 100s of trades. I only buy when I get a confirmation. Ask me for the receipts. 

Next, I&#39;ll trade $ATVI + $CRWD + $SNOW + $ZIM + $NVAX,2022-12-27T22:52:30Z

‚ÄúThe rates are still 50% higher than the 2019 level of about US$4,000 per FEU (40-foot equivalent unit),‚Äù he tells The Edge. ‚ÄúPeople say rates are normalising. However, it depends on the trade lanes. For example, freight costs from here to Australia are now more expensive than to the US West Coast.
