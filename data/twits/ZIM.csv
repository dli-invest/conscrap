$9+ estimate for this quarter, should mean few dollar dividend declared,2022-11-15T21:21:15Z
$ZIM hated unfairly and time will come. It has more liquid cash than it‚Äôs market cap. It can pay 50 % dividend annually. Just $3.25/quarter is $13, which is almost 50% of the current price. Yes, I‚Äôm aware of the 25% Israeli tax on dividends.,2022-11-15T21:06:11Z

$ZIM dripping my divi to average down,2022-11-15T20:25:22Z
$ZIM judging by the action / price range the past two weeks and whisper numbers ---people expect the dividend to be around $3 and value the stock after divy payout still in the 20s. I think forward guidance and Q4 divy expectations (LARGE divy compared to Q1,2,3) will be more telling and affect the SP more in 2023 run up. IMO.,2022-11-15T20:22:21Z
