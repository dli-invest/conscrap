In addition, quarterly accounts are to be published (probably positive) and we are also awaiting possible dividends. 
It should be added that the accounts are quite healthy and that they will already take delivery between 2023 and 2024 of 28 green LNG dual-fuel container ships. This means that they have been able to invest with the debt issued and still maintain positive cash flows. It is truly spectacular and normal that in 2021 they will have the highest annual net profit ever achieved by an Israeli company and will pay the highest dividend in history.

$ZIM We take a brief look at the situation:  
We are in a period very similar to stagflation, i.e. crisis + inflation. That is why the best values are usually commodities (raw materials and transport). 
Thus, with the rise in freight rates, shipping lines continue to increase their revenues, due to 1. the collapse of ports and the high demand for sea containers (which is no longer the case, because covid measures have improved) 
 
 2. the war in Ukraine which &quot;favours&quot; the rise in the price of raw materials (inflation). In addition, it should be noted that the port of Shanghai is ALREADY up and running and that work will be done to ease the bottlenecks. ZIM is a company that has been in existence for more than half a century, with fairly healthy accounts and a good debt repayment ratio.,2022-05-15T17:41:44Z

South Korea&#39;s largest container shipper just reported: 
 
HMM‚Äôs net profit surged 1,932.8 percent on year to 3.13 trillion won ($2.4 billion) in the first quarter, beating market expectations as shipping fees soared. 
 
The figure was higher than FnGuide‚Äôs market consensus of 2.49 trillion won. 
 
It logged revenue of 4.92 trillion won, up 102.6 percent on year. Operating profit jumped 208.9 percent to 3.15 trillion won. Both exceeded market expectations and are record high figures. 
 
HMM said its profit and revenue soared as freight charges rose for most of the routes it ships to, especially those connecting the United States and Europe. 
 
The Shanghai Containerized Freight Index, which indicates sea freight rates of cargo shipments, rose 74.5 percent on year to an average 4,851 points in the first quarter.

$DAC from the FY2018 10K report - DAC took a combined $626M in impairment losses in FY2016 and FY2018, primarily on vessels. I haven&#39;t looked in-depth as to whether DAC still owns all of these ships, but it seems likely that DAC book value of PPE / assets / equity are understated 
 
using balance sheet values from the FY2021 10-K, DAC currently trades at  0.77x book equity. Adjusting for dividends and expected Q1 earnings, I conservatively estimate that DAC is currently trading closer to ~0.68x book equity. if we assume that of this $626M impairment charge, ~$300M (48%) of the impairment was taken ahead of the turnaround in the container / vessel market, DAC is trading at an even further discount to the true economic value of its assets (~0.60x &quot;true&quot; book equity, which is wildly cheap for a company with relatively fixed earnings...) 
 
this also assumes that $ZIM has stayed flat since 12/31/2021 (+12% YTD) :),2022-05-14T13:45:01Z
