Contrasting outlooks 
 
Bjorn Vang Jensen, VP Advisory Services - Global Supply Chain for Sea-Intelligence, said in a post on LinkedIn earlier this week, ‚ÄúI don&#39;t know a single medium-large BCO who is not renegotiating right now, or gearing up to do so within the next month.‚Äù Jensen has had a career that has spanned both the shipper and carrier sides of the equation. 
 
By contrast Xeneta in its latest Ocean Pulse Survey found little evidence of shippers calling for negotiations and rates falling sharply. Peter Sand, Chief Analyst at Xeneta, said:  
 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôd say, from our dialogue with some of the world‚Äôs biggest shippers, that the outlook is actually significantly more stable.‚Äù,2022-09-13T03:06:53Z

The Drewry composite World Container Index (WCI) published on Thursday also showed a continued falling trend if less sharply than the SCFI. The index decreased by 5% to $5,378.68 per feu compared to the previous week. It is the 28th consecutive weekly decrease of the WCI which has dropped by 47% compared with the same week in 2021. 
 
Drewry said the sharpest decrease was seen on the Shanghai ‚Äì Los Angeles route dropping 14% or $780 to $4,782 per feu. 
 
While both indexes remain far above historical averages the continued sharp rate of spot container freight is increasingly drawing questions as to whether the box sector is now facing a sharp correction with the impact filtering into all important long term contract rates.,2022-09-13T03:06:05Z

One example of the sharp decline in pricing is the 50% decline in cost to ship from China to the West Coast of the USA, with a 40-foot container on this route now coming in at around $5,400. In the past week alone a 14% drop in prices on the Shanghai to Los Angeles route has registered. 
 
European rates still sit higher, but are likewise sharply down. Similar containers from Asia into Europe are now coming in at around $9,000, which is over 40% lower than rates at the start of this year. In September of 2021, when supply chain shocks were a major cause for concern across the cycling industry, the rates had tipped north of $20,000 on some routes. The net result of this surge in pricing and lack of container availability led some larger box shifters to charter their own vessels to get around the bottlenecks.,2022-09-13T03:03:05Z
$ZIM  The reality in the container shipping world is that spot rates continue to follow a well-forecasted, gradual and predictable glide-path lower, while contract rates  move sideways to higher based on the reality that container ship availability will actually contract moving into 2023 (despite the hype of looking only at new builds, and ignoring extensively delayed scrapping due to excess demand)... The convergence of these factors along with inflation will cause rates to stabilize and form a new base run rate much higher than pre-pandemic levels...

$ZIM when I send stuff over sea‚Äôs the price is still the same for me as it was 6 months  ago.
