$ZIM omg it&#39;s not a good day üòû,2022-10-27T15:46:32Z
$ZIM has anyone realized two things about this stock? #1- it‚Äôs trading at a price to book of 0.5 or worse. This means when a $5 dividend is paid out, it won‚Äôt drop $5 but $2.5 unless the price to book goes significantly lower. There is guidance that dividend would be about $15 between now and end of Q1. Let‚Äôs say that to correct for the market, that goes to $10. So that means $10 a share in upside value over 5 months (28%) - that amount * the price to book ratio (which is already ridiculously low). So let‚Äôs say $5. So that‚Äôs $5 of highly probable upside even at these absurd multiples and given a reduction of the dividend by 33%. 

#2- shorts (and there are a lot of them) have to pay the above dividend (likely $5 by first week or so of December) or close their position. That‚Äôs a real squeeze set up. Same for Q1. 

People who are trading the shipping slowdown are ignoring these realities that are structural to this stock and the 60+ year track record of this business.,2022-10-27T15:42:02Z
Container prices have tanked in the last 9 months.  We now pay $4,000 for a half container from China to CA vs. $20,000 9 months ago.  That can‚Äôt be good for margins.  I hope I am wrong but $ZIM could fall more,2022-10-27T14:19:43Z

$ZIM OMG OMG OMG ...you guys need to chill out.  Set your buy order and just sit back and wait don&#39;t even look at the price.   Stop being so jumpy and freaking out especially if your in it for the long haul,2022-10-27T13:55:10Z
$ZIM every open this stock sells off.  It‚Äôs crazy that every morning some shareholder wants to sell no matter the price.  The sellers then slow down after 11 am.  This is usually a sign of institutional manipulation playing games with retailers well they build a position.  They may force a sell off down to 21 dollars just to scare the retailers silly then whip it to 30 dollars,2022-10-27T13:50:35Z
