$ZIM Technical downtrend. Next support test is 44 dollars.,2022-06-11T22:35:48Z
$ZIM Great stock but i think their profits wont be anywhere near last quarter China was not shut down last quarter, this quarter China has  been shut down most of the quarter so I believe there profits will tank next earnings date and the stock price will suffer but In my opinion I cant see this going below $44.00 to $45.00 that is  my target to get back in.

$STNG Should be at $4-7/ share now.... This market makes no sense yet $ZIM down almost 20% last few days. Short STNG long zim,2022-06-11T18:04:44Z
$ZIM If you apply the same TTM PE of TSLA (100) to ZIM you would get a price of $5000/ share for Zim. Zim might deserve a higher current PE, considering it has a (YOY) quarterly revenue growth of 100%, higher than TSLAs of only 80%.,2022-06-11T17:48:16Z
$ZIM All they have to do is maintain half of current earnings and defensive money could start flowing back into the shipping sector. Remember, Zim blessed the market by becoming one of the most lucrative and sucessful IPOS of the last 5-10 years,2022-06-11T17:36:18Z
$ZIM First off, let me apologize to all of you for buying ZIM. I have a pretty solid record for killing off investments (JDSU, MCOM, real estate in 2007....the list goes on). 
I bought ZIM because Americans are consumers who make nothing but have lots of money (a generalization I know, and not intended as social commentary, just a fact). Western Europe is similar, but not to the degree of America. Asians make stuff and want to get money for it. They have to get stuff to America. Shipping is the only way to do it. Doesn&#39;t particularly matter that fuel prices are high, raise shipping rates, Americans want stuff and dollars are going to flow to people who make stuff as long as Americans have dollars. 
If you ignore the peaks in the charts created by traders capitalizing on expected price fluctuation around dividend distribution, ZIM is pretty solid.  It may dip into the 40&#39;s, but it is not going broke and it is committed to paying a dividend. Buy the dips and hold for the dividend.,2022-06-11T17:36:12Z

$ZIM If rates come down and they make less money. The company will still be in good financial shape and the world will still be a mess, Next year may be different, but it is impossible to predict. I focus on now.,2022-06-11T16:19:37Z

$ZIM the shipping companies have literally been printing money the last 18 months. Can someone explain why (beside &quot;supply chain disruption&quot;). I suppose they didn&#39;t sink their boats during COVID so there should be enough vessels and competition to keep pricing down?,2022-06-11T05:22:26Z
