$ZIM Ex-div. Date supposed to be in Monday (August 29) so why we opened yesterday (August 26) with 4.75$ less?,2022-08-27T17:48:48Z
$ZIM you see the problem is, zim should be $400 per share.  
 
Then it would have a normal dividend and a normal PE ratio.  
 
And not all the kerfuffle about dividends.  
 
Nobody cares about getting taxed on a 1.5% yield dividend. Stock.,2022-08-27T17:18:53Z

$ZIM only thing that worries me about ZIM, is the fact they lease their ships which is an expense rather than owning the ships, which is an asset. Expenses change, assets depreciate. Over the long term ships leases can go up like rent,2022-08-27T11:54:07Z
$ZIM I lost money on this Friday on a short term trade. No big deal that‚Äôs trading lol. I also hold it in a long term account. Only a little over a 1000 shares at just over $48 entry pre dividend. I am fine with it dropping. In a cash account and will buy more with dividends as it drops. Even at $1 a quarter(don‚Äôt see it happening) dividend will still be very good. Bring on the $30s and $20s  I am no where near a full position.  I like their focus on paying LONG TERM shareholders(read conference call). Sell OTM calls a couple times a year and it gets pretty interesting.,2022-08-27T11:44:28Z

$ZIM This stock feels like Petrobras at 10dollars. It will have capital appreciation of at least 50 to 80 percent a year from now and a yield of 25% for the next 3-4 years.  A cash cow stock like this is not a good place for shorties! They should  get their lesson in a week or two but not for now! Now is the time to buy more stock at these ridiculous levels under 50. I remind you: P/E under 1, DY&gt;30%, net debt=negative, 7year time charter deal for 6 new cont. ships for 100mill per ship with potential earnings of 200mill per ship! For a value investor it doesn&#39;t get any better than this!,2022-08-27T10:54:21Z

When comparing the current price to the book value of $ZIM, it is valued rather cheaply. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/ZIM/fundamental-analysis?key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-08-27T08:55:00Z
$ZIM is this a long term buy?  I compared to the stock price with OOCL.  OOCL has its lowest price at -134/share to current 219/ share. There has been divvy to shareholders every year since 2001 except 2018. Seems to be a good long term investment.,2022-08-27T06:04:51Z

$ZIM - Shipping ETF (SEA) was down 3% today. It seems that ZIM was oversold vs its peers in the back of its div.
