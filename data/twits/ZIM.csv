$ZIM I just buy weekly to accumulate and compound those dividends. Dips are great when they are available. You can buy Meta until the cows come home but your just wasting time and money.,2023-04-27T22:12:02Z
$ZIM Tech sector doesn&#39;t use shipping I guess. Brutal.,2023-04-27T22:02:14Z

$ZIM sold some old business equipment now have 24K to buy more,2023-04-27T21:13:52Z
$ZIM Last green day was on  APRIL 14 despite of Nasdaq having a 3% gain today. Trying to figure out why shorts can be so stupid but the fact Hedge Funds have unlimited amount of money they do not use in a productive way.,2023-04-27T21:09:25Z
$ZIM zim did ok .. but failed to stay  above 17,.. which means it broken the virgin marry and its heading to 15.50,2023-04-27T20:28:41Z
$ZIM I thought my app was broke all day, never seen this green color on zim before.  They fixed it at the last second though.,2023-04-27T20:26:40Z
$ZIM Not sure why shorts picked ZIM when there are so many unprofitable companies out there to short . The fact ZIM is trading close to its 52 week low has factored most of the bad news. Meanwhile other shipping stocks like SBLK, GOGL, .... are over 3% today.,2023-04-27T20:25:49Z

$ZIM this is some serious buying opportunity.  I&#39;ll add 100 more tomorrow,2023-04-27T20:16:05Z
$ZIM let‚Äôs see if my 16.50 put gets put to me tomorrow - I have a feeling I won‚Äôt get that lucky,2023-04-27T20:15:02Z
$ZIM Hilarious. Fucking assholes,2023-04-27T19:59:56Z
$ZIM kind of crazy to see the market on fire and this hitting 52 week lows üò≠üò≠üò≠ i told you all every Israeli stock is a scam stock üòÇüòÇüòÇ,2023-04-27T19:48:04Z
$ZIM shorts are waiting for Powel Power next week before covering any shares.,2023-04-27T19:09:30Z
@Srsfitnessinc except for the fact that it‚Äôs an Israeli company. Then it can be a p/e of less than 1 like $ZIM,2023-04-27T18:52:09Z
$ZIM Nasdaq up 2.62 and we are lucky if it closes green.,2023-04-27T18:48:09Z
$ZIM 
If I hadn‚Äôt opened my mouth and flapped my gums on recognition of chart patterns, this thing would have went to low 16‚Äôs today.,2023-04-27T18:43:40Z
$ZIM WHAT A PEACE OF CHIT... BACK DOWN TO RED,. WHILE EVERYONE IS GREEN,..  DIFFENATLY  INSIDERS SELLING,2023-04-27T18:41:41Z
$HUSA Buying low. $KNOP &amp; $ZIM also.,2023-04-27T18:23:43Z
$ZIM When the DOW drops ZIM will fall. Positive outlook is reported in the Tech Nasdaq. Why DOW up? I don&#39;t know. I guess we will see by end of day. Other news is flat. Keep your eyes open.,2023-04-27T18:13:46Z
$ZIM Can someone please tell me why this is so cheap. Dividends alone for 1 year almost cover the stock price. Surely I&#39;m missing something.,2023-04-27T18:04:32Z
$ZIM it won‚Äôt stay at this price for long. I‚Äôm buying more now because they will run to 20s soon, as they away do‚Ä¶,2023-04-27T17:54:18Z
$ZIM 75% drop in EPS forecasted for 2023, assume that same % applies to dividend then total dividend for all 4 quarters would be approximately $4.00 (dropped from $16.95). But guess what, still easily a 20% yield at the newly adjusted metrics. I‚Äôve got buy orders at $15.00 but I‚Äôm super close to changing my mind and buying here. Will watch closely the next few days &amp; weeks.,2023-04-27T16:52:25Z
$ZIM Nasdaq over 2% and they will drive zim to red . Part of the big plan to frustrate investors before they run it some two weeks from now.,2023-04-27T16:44:23Z
