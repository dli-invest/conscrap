$ZIM 

I’ve got a huge position down there. You’re gonna have to stop me out cause I’m not selling this paper,2023-01-25T03:22:55Z
$ZIM tempted,2023-01-25T00:20:53Z
$ZIM &quot;CIBC Asset Management Inc increased its stake in ZIM Integrated Shipping Services Ltd. by 51.2% in the third quarter&quot;... If the trolls here make you anxious, this is the sort of news that should help to support your faith. That said, I will be rather sad if the price ticks up dramatically in the next weeks, before I receive my dividend.,2023-01-24T22:09:46Z

$ZIM LOADED With APRIL C  OPTIONS!😉🧨,2023-01-24T21:14:31Z
$ZIM if breaks .88 looks good for but over 19.   We will see if the wave keeps rolling.,2023-01-24T20:08:07Z
$ZIM shorts have borrowed all of my shares and i still cant buy any for under $18… i wish i had put more into it at $16.80 - 17.09,2023-01-24T20:05:03Z
$ZIM watching shorts cover at thelast hour is always funny. They should know to short in the mornings.,2023-01-24T20:05:02Z
$ZIM rsi and range looking good now.  We will see if the push keeps going to 19.20. would prefer 19.50.  but not greedy. Just want good range for 20 for the week. And stay there until can reinvest divy.  Lol.,2023-01-24T19:49:43Z
$ZIM you drop into watch about every 3 days. You said the same thing last time. And was wrong.  Yes it will do waves. But it has way too much support to drop that low.   But I could be wrong too. We will see.,2023-01-24T19:23:53Z
$ZIM It&#39;s going back to $17.5,2023-01-24T19:19:02Z
$ZIM think it&#39;s gathering support. Going to add 2k shares here at .80,2023-01-24T18:36:36Z
$ZIM and there&#39;s the lunch time over dip.  Will start to push up again if it stays with last 5 trading days pattern.,2023-01-24T18:11:51Z
$ZIM an &quot;educated&quot; guess at Q4 dividend - IF they pay 50% of income...they made $34.92/share for first 3 quarter and paid $10.55/share in dividends....that would leave $6.91/share in dividend to still pay and lets say they make $5/share in Q4 then total dividend for Q4 would be $6.91/share PLUS $2.50/share = $9.41/share Q4 dividend IF they pay out 50% (which they have in the past),2023-01-24T18:10:19Z
$ZIM NVM. Starting to bleed like the rest of the market.  It won&#39;t be a bad bleed though,2023-01-24T17:58:37Z
$ZIM Looks like shorts trying desperately to keep this under $19,2023-01-24T17:56:02Z
$ZIM 2023 guidance?,2023-01-24T17:54:18Z
$ZIM betting when the after lunch trading starts in 30 mins. This pushes to 19.50 to end for the day. It&#39;s trending that way.,2023-01-24T17:45:15Z
$ZIM interesting day.. the entire market is bleeding like hell. But zim is trucking along getting higher.,2023-01-24T17:32:23Z
$ZIM LFG!!!!🚀 🚀 🚀,2023-01-24T17:21:46Z
$ZIM My brain busted and I accidentally added 2x the amount of shares I had planned. We&#39;ll see how that goes 🤷‍♂️,2023-01-24T17:04:34Z
$ZIM 25,2023-01-24T16:58:58Z
$ZIM she’s going green!!! Let’s go!!!,2023-01-24T16:21:08Z
$ZIM Still early but I don&#39;t see 17&#39;s again. The Dow could dive to 30000 then 17.90 might happen for a few seconds. 20&#39;s will disappear in three weeks.,2023-01-24T16:19:37Z
$ZIM shorts.,2023-01-24T15:55:44Z
$ZIM massively undervalued and has a clear buyer at 16.20-17 and now someone is defending this higher low. 

Even if yearly rev drops a ton they’ll still be insanely profitable and even if dividend cut in half still a massive dividend. Too much cash is a winning equation in this market,2023-01-24T15:55:10Z
$ZIM when in doubt look at the magical buy orders in opening in options.. 500k plus shares at a time…  with low volume on shares trading… shorty over played in here and they know it trying to cover… facts over some random news posting bear 💩!! 5.8b in cash shorty tells me you FVCKING retarded..,2023-01-24T15:47:02Z
$ZIM the amazing thing is shorty buying at $19.30 now to cover… yet so below $19?? How very magical 🧙‍♀️… 2x cash on hand then market cap!!,2023-01-24T15:20:16Z
$ZIM this is normal right?? Millions of shares trying to be covered and sp down?? 🤣🤣🤣🤣 shorty your stupidity is showing!! Where seeking alpha and jpm analyst with anther doom and gloom hit job here??? Predatory trading is illegal shorty!!!!,2023-01-24T15:13:28Z
