$ZIM if you don‚Äôt mind buying too high for the privilege of having a large chunk of your capital returned to you as taxable income, sure go ahead and chase the dividend.,2022-03-16T05:19:40Z

$ZIM oh no, Cramer‚Äôs not a big fan.  What ever will we do?,2022-03-16T01:23:12Z
$ZIM this is the only stock I LOVE IN this POS,2022-03-16T00:38:22Z
$ZIM I guess it will drop about the dividend amount on a few days. Anyway, this company is a fucking money printer. We have been trading growth stocks with no earnings until 2025 for the last couple of years and this beast is trading at x2P/E with a monster dividend lmao,2022-03-16T00:29:41Z
$ZIM how is the dividend paid for contracts ?? It‚Äôs based on the number of contracts you own not shares per contract??? Ty for the help!!,2022-03-16T00:22:13Z
$ZIM With a dividend of $17 coming up, the stock should drop by that amount.  However, will this occur on the ex-dividend date, record date or immediately after?,2022-03-16T00:14:10Z
$ZIM how high by the end of week?!,2022-03-15T23:37:30Z
$ZIM Is this everyone&#39;s first divy rodeo? I mean - it&#39;s on a super run and congrats but it most certainly will pull back. Every ex-div has this pattern ( but this again has an impressive run up).,2022-03-15T22:55:50Z
$ZIM Just buy few shares on or before 03/22 and hold few days to get 17$ dividends?? Easy money?,2022-03-15T22:37:19Z
$ZIM March 17th gap up to $87.20/30 and then reversal sell to $80,2022-03-15T22:31:09Z
$ZIM So the pullback after the dividend?  How big,2022-03-15T22:29:52Z

$ZIM do you guys see how much money this company pulls in each quarter holy shit how is this stock not $500 a share yet that blows my mind,2022-03-15T22:05:42Z
$ZIM Happy for everyone who bought in the 40s. This stock is killing it.  I doubted it though when I heard about it through $CTRM board. Now I&#39;ve been waiting for the perfect PUT.  Look at $DKS after it&#39;s dividend rally.  Money to be made on the sell off for SURE!,2022-03-15T22:04:50Z
$ZIM At this rate, this gig might hit 200 by end of year!,2022-03-15T22:01:28Z

$ZIM 17 dollar Dividend will be paid April 3rd, but must have bought and held as of March 23rd. This is a perfect long. Carrier Shipping is where the goose that lays the golden egg lives. ZIM owns seven ships, for those that think ZIM doesn&#39;t own ships. Carrier Shipping on which entire economies depend on, will increase in value for years to come. ZIM is in the top 20 globally. 2 times price earnings, puts this stock easily at 120-300 and it would still be extremely inexpensive.
