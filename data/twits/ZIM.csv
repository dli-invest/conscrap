$ZIM somehow the 25% Israeli tax and then US tax will substantially take the  zing out of this. It needs to move up so that investors don‚Äôt loose money ( which it does in the past),2022-03-22T21:07:05Z
$ZIM i wouldn&#39;t mind with the fundamentals and tech if this bad boy didn&#39;t even provide dividends, let alone the most shareholder caring stock in its space, the tesla of Industrials &amp; Transports, if u own 525 Zim, you&#39;d be Making $8925, minus the 25% Tax = getting Payed $6,900 every quarter and growing.  Just added another 100, something tells me she&#39;s gonna pay out 10 grand and up next quarter. üòèüí∏üíØ,2022-03-22T20:48:45Z

$ZIM  Couldn‚Äôt ask for better price action so far this week for anyone long going into ex-dividend date.  Did all sellers from after earnings get back in today, or will we get some FOMO before next pullback?,2022-03-22T20:28:49Z
$ZIM that was a beautiful end to the day, finishing on strength. I have never had a stock with such a large dividend before and it was pretty nerve wracking seeing my trading account with a whopping big minus on it, even with the dividend coming in. Of course those who bought two weeks ago for $68-70 are laughing all the way but I figured a drop from that level could break the upward trend. My idiocy and lack of vision cost me a lot. As a former Navy chap, son of a Navy chap and grandson of a Merchant Navy WW2 vet, I love the idea of this stock. I will have to exit again some time this month to allocate to a merger deal but the fundamentals have convinced me and I will be back, even if I have to pay more for the privilege. I love the leasing arrangements of the ships giving flexibility, low p/e and the fair and adjustable div policy that rewards but also keeps it limited by earnings and not an artificial debt led thing to hold the price up.,2022-03-22T20:22:21Z
