$ZIM where the hell can you get a $6+ dollar dividend today for a Q and jump 12 % in a day? 
I&#39;m here until they stop issuing dividend, which is highly unlikely. Stop trading this, don&#39;t be greedy and see how we all fly together.,2023-04-12T01:34:27Z

Earnings in 32 days. Ex dividend date in 44 days. Payment in 56 days. According to stock events.,2023-04-12T01:04:32Z
$ZIM  no.

The stock trades at less than half book/sh. And below cash/share.

Small float. Beautiful chart. What&#39;s not to like  ?

Oh ya. There is the divy as well.
