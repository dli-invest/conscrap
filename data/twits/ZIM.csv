$ZIM wal street investor predicting zim will be 0.000001 cents in 2023 
 
They actually published this.  
 
And it will too if they don&#39;t fix the dividend tax. Math will force it there.  
 
Why would anyone pay 0.000002 cents when it&#39;s guarenteed to go down more?,2022-12-15T02:05:15Z
$ZIM what about the crooked hf and mm&#39;s,2022-12-15T01:24:09Z

$ZIM well at least it’s not down 5% like usual so I guess it’s a win,2022-12-14T23:31:26Z
$ZIM I had discussed Zim being a different co from the old Zim precovid and having essentially no debt but leases with a very dense first order thinker,recently.

Here&#39;s a letter from Zim stating exactly what I said.

My alerts for LARGE caps. I have timestamps + buy fills for everything What&#39;s my win rate?

I ONLY buy when Algos are tired of selling. How? I buy when &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; is low.

It&#39;s a simple strategy. Learn what &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; by Algos.

I don&#39;t make 100s of trades. I only buy when I get a confirmation. Ask me for the receipts. 

Next, I&#39;ll trade $ATVI + $CRWD + $SNOW + $ZIM,2022-12-14T23:04:26Z

$ZIM looks like some decent support at 17.50.  I’m waiting for management to give themselves some more cheap options and warrants done here.  Eli Glickman sold 500,000 share he optioned at 5 dollars and then he will get a couple hundred thousand options for free.  Then the game restarts,2022-12-14T19:46:52Z
$ZIM here we go,2022-12-14T19:38:55Z
$ZIM they shoukd take the dividend money and donate it to a charity every quarter.  
 
The stock would go up triple the amount of the dividend every time.   
 
Seriously.,2022-12-14T18:51:33Z
$ZIM what index you guys looking at? The Freightos Bulk Index or the Harpex charter rate index. As soon as both bottom out it may be an entry point.,2022-12-14T18:25:05Z
$ZIM going through foreign tax credits with one of my clients who owns ZIM really shows me why so many people are avoiding ZIM in North America.  In Canada you get a 15 percent foreign tax credit but the actual dividend is taxed as income.  If it’s in a registers account you lose the tax deferral.  It’s a literal disaster for individual shareholders.   All these newbies are going to get a tax and dividend lesson in the future,2022-12-14T18:09:05Z
