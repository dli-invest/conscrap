$ZIM Before 2021, ZIM&#39;s income from voyages was always in the $3-4B region (mostly $3.5-4.0B) going back to 2012. From this must be deducted the operating expenses, $2.7-3.5B per year. 
 
There are other expenses, but you can see that the scope for profits at this level of income is quite tight, with the best pre-tax profit of $0.5B (about 1/8th of this year&#39;s) being achieved in 2020.  
 
This was a result of getting expenses under control during a period of low freight rates ($1229 per TEU). 
 
If freight rates hit rock bottom for an extended period, I believe we would see 2020-like performance from ZIM, which amounts to EPS of about $5. 
 
Even if rates continue to slide, we should see a small dividend. Things will look up once China opens, the fed stops tightening, a recession is averted and Putin gives up.  
 
If you don&#39;t believe me, take it as a fairy tale.,2022-12-04T06:59:06Z

$ZIM ex div date has already passed, sorry shorts there‚Äôs no more free rides down.   Now the pay dates are when investors actually receive the cash and can reinvest their funds and buy stock.  That means millions of buy orders to push the stock higher will hit next week.  Starting on Wednesday I think.  Just think what happens to the average volume when a couple hundred million dollars in buy transactions hit on Wednesday on a slow market day.  Algos will start front running this on Monday you can believe.,2022-12-04T02:37:09Z

$ZIM If ZIM payed a Special dividend out of retained earnings of $20shr our company would still be more valuable with more money in the bank than when ZIM went public 2 years ago. Bigger, better, stronger in every way!! Fact!!,2022-12-03T22:50:51Z
