$ZIM what I don’t understand is why the other shippers are valued 4-5x higher than us on a p/e basis. They’re all subject to the same spot rates. The same issues with recession, etc. why are they trading 1.6-2.0x p.e but we are at .4? Why is this the only one being valued so low if we all have the same problems?,2022-10-03T04:35:10Z
An Altman-Z score of 4.60 indicates that $ZIM is not in any danger for bankruptcy at the moment. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/ZIM/fundamental-analysis?key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-10-03T03:48:00Z

$ZIM Hedge funds, ETF&#39;s, Mutual funds, etc will begin rebalancing for Q4 after having dumped their dogs last week. It&#39;ll be interesting and I am expecting a nice start for another bear market rally. Might could even last thru the midterm elections. Only 34 trading days till ZIM announces earnings and dividend $$. So we got that going for us too.,2022-10-02T21:05:20Z

@UncleFree  $ZIM someone please explain to me why this is trading like they are having a going out of business sale. It appears to be very oversold with 7 consecutive weekly red candles with the last 5 sliding down a steep lower BB. Earnings and dividends have been solid. Is it coming to an end?,2022-10-02T04:32:06Z

$ZIM Can someone smart explain to me how their dividend is paid? I assume it is based on earnings, and it seems to fluctuate markedly, and include special dividends. I assume they can&#39;t sustain their high yield, but I&#39;m curious how far this will likely decline and whether folks think their dividend is safe. Any info will be helpful as I do my D on this one. I see further downside rick but with a strong dividend, I&#39;ll take this as a good long term play.,2022-10-01T18:16:58Z

$VOC $PXD $GOGL $ZIM $AGLXY $ISNPY

Have you sold growth stocks and need to reinvest the funds into today&#39;s current high dividend value performers?

Israeli based Zim Shipping with 100% shipping dividends;

Bermuda based Golden Ocean with 32% shipping  dividends;

Texas based Pioneer Natural Resources with 9.74% energy dividends;

Houston, Texas VOC Oil Trust with 17% energy dividends;

Australian based AGL Energy&#39;s offers 10% utility dividends.

Italian based Intesa Sanpaulo&#39;s 18% bank dividends, which may be subject to change and may decrease or increase 6%.

This is an amazing strategy adds comfort during hostile market correction. Wait at least one month before buying growth and tech stocks.,2022-09-30T23:34:52Z

$ZIM when gas price high -&gt; shipping rates high , they said &quot; Gas high = less profit&quot; and short it , and when then gas price drop -&gt; shipping rates drop , they said  &quot; shipping rates drop = less profit&quot; and short it😂 I don&#39;t care what they said , atleast , it helped me adding at discount price and collecting dividend 🤤,2022-09-30T22:09:10Z
