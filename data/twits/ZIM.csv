$ZIM Schwab won‚Äôt let me auto reinvest dividends :( guess I‚Äôll just have to do it manually,2023-01-16T17:04:33Z
$ZIM just learning about dividends etc, is that right this has a 176% dividend yield? That seems crazy high?

So I would only need to invest $681/$682 to make $100 a month in dividends?,2023-01-16T15:51:23Z

$ZIM but it could be as simple as container rates over shorted and reality isn‚Äôt reflected in markets.. $jpm trying to cover saying barcoding for next two years to unwind.. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£,2023-01-16T15:47:50Z
$ZIM the sad thing is airlines should be reporting the greatest amount of eps growth in history from air freight rates.. more profits to fly freight per kg than a person.. it‚Äôs like airline hiding profits‚Ä¶ maybe from unions?? Or tax fraud?? Or from debt collectors?? Maybe a combination‚Ä¶. 200lb person paying $200 = $1 a lb vs 200lb  package paying $500 = $5 per 1lb‚Ä¶ freight only going one way from manufacturer to consumer is the only explanation airlines dead heading back to manufacturer‚Ä¶ but even so more profitable saving on fuel costs round trip.. airline love to lose money..,2023-01-16T15:43:41Z

Guess someone woke up to simple facts worldwide consumption for good climbing consumers demand flying around the world.. get it flying around the world air freight .. air freight rate stable at all time highs for months now.. looking like it‚Äôs about to leg up‚Ä¶,2023-01-16T15:24:02Z
$ZIM all I see is air freight keeps smacking all time highs and companies paying outrageous rates and fees for air freight!! Shorty telling me container rates going to zero and shippers going to lose money!! Would anyone here go work for dominos delivery and lose money?? Anyone here going to deliver packages for amazon and not get paid?? Jpm Shorty is full of horse üí©!! Go short air freight prices and move on theirs no win for you if you late to the game trying to short container prices here‚Ä¶,2023-01-16T15:16:49Z
