$ZIM the divi is higher than the stock price? Why not just use a straddle after going long and collect it all?,2022-12-08T05:10:16Z
$ZIM so glad I sold in the 60s and collected some sweet dividends. Shit has TANKED,2022-12-08T03:50:39Z

$ZIM this is so oversold,2022-12-08T03:23:24Z
$ZIM this might be the worst stock ever aside from a bankruptcy.,2022-12-08T03:19:30Z
$ZIM night zimi&#39;s enjoy that fat divi that no other company will give you,2022-12-08T02:46:43Z
$ZIM these shipping stocks always do this. It‚Äôs a criminal enterprise imo,2022-12-08T02:25:27Z
$ZIM Is 10 USD  a good price to buy or still overvalued ?,2022-12-08T02:24:30Z
$ZIM i have been thinking of buying this since 26. Thankfully just thinking.
The price now seems crazy. I understand freight rates are going down but still the price at less than half the book value? What am I missing?
Is the management corrupt? Is there something hidden between the lines I can‚Äôt see in the balance sheet?
Any view on where is this headed?,2022-12-08T02:07:00Z

$ZIM Is over?,2022-12-08T01:50:59Z
$ZIM This  year  only,  l  lost  $300k with  this  shit!  lt  is  a  huge  amount for  me.  Shame  on  Eli  Glickman.  Shame  on  ZIM.  They  had  to  buy  back  long  time  ago.  Nobody  cared  and  they  lured  investors with  their  shitty  before  tax  dividend  trick.  Time  to  wait  and  hope  for  a  quick  recovery.  Destiny‚Ä¶,2022-12-08T01:44:00Z
$ZIM So many debt laden negative EBITDA zombie companies out there that are in serious trouble with the Fed hiking rates aggressively. 

Where would you rather be than in a company with no debt and a cash hoard 2x its market cap and trailing EBITDA 4x its market cap?

I‚Äôm holding here for the long term. This has the potential to go up several
Hundred % easily in the next year or two.,2022-12-08T01:29:59Z
$ZIM to the guy at 60 who said to be real careful at these levels.....you&#39;re the real MVP of this board.,2022-12-08T01:26:57Z
$ZIM Glad I pull out right after the ex-dividend date. If not I&#39;ll be losing a lot.,2022-12-08T01:17:29Z
$ZIM As predicted last week, this one is going to the range of 12 - 14 dollars.,2022-12-08T01:10:53Z

$ZIM will they pay a dividend in the future,2022-12-07T23:52:50Z
$ZIM got my divvy. Time for more puts. It‚Äôs shitting season not shipping season üëÄüòÇ,2022-12-07T23:48:10Z
$ZIM guys calm down about the dividend not being in your account. You&#39;ll probably see them Monday. If you haven&#39;t been holding long, you haven&#39;t seen that it usually takes a bit to process. Probably something to do with the foreign government tax or something. I&#39;ve noticed a couple of my foreign stocks take a couple extra days to reflect.,2022-12-07T23:44:36Z
