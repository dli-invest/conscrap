This and $ZIM are crazy undervalued 

ZIM with greater risk and reward but both are ones I‚Äôll continue to add,2022-12-23T03:36:33Z
$ZIM can‚Äôt pamp or squeeze this. There are way many bagholders that would end your hype, as usual.
World economy will get worse, China is not mRNA vaccinated and isolated. Lock down is inevitable.

$ZIM I wonder why none of the seeking alpha don‚Äôt disclose they paid by the shorts stuck here since ipo.. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ you know @cnbc shorty stuck with paying my dividend!!!! $275 and you can cover with my shares.. open a $275 strike so I can sell $275 covered calls‚Ä¶,2022-12-22T19:26:48Z
$ZIM the only way to lose long term is if their earnings drop to zero in 2024 and never recover. Ever.  
 
EVER.  
 
Like, nuclear war kills 6 billion people and we go back to the stone age ever.  
 
Even then, wouldn&#39;t ships be the most valuable things left on planet earth? Even without fuel? You can rig up sails on them easy enough and float around in the ocean.  
 
I don&#39;t understand what investors are pricing in here.  
 
They obviously aren&#39;t pricing anything. Its just short short short because there is no other play because the dividends are toxic.  
 
I don&#39;t see a graceful way out of the dividend trap. It&#39;s too obvious if this bounces off the bottom over and over and rallies in between  dividends. It&#39;s too easy to 100% win just by riding each wave and jumping off before EX day. And it can&#39;t go below zero therefore a short squeeze into meme stock is the only way back to sane valuations. I have no idea when. Could be as late as 2025. Could be next dividend.,2022-12-22T19:08:42Z

My alerts for LARGE caps. I have timestamps + buy fills for everything What&#39;s my win rate?

I ONLY buy when Algos are tired of selling. How? I buy when &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; is low.

It&#39;s a simple strategy. Learn what &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; by Algos.

I don&#39;t make 100s of trades. I only buy when I get a confirmation. Ask me for the receipts. 

Next, I&#39;ll trade $ATVI + $CRWD + $SNOW + $ZIM + $NVAX,2022-12-22T00:20:13Z
