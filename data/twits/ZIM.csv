$ZIM entire market had a Terrible closing, fully expecting bloodbath tomorrow but i hope not. Short term candles look insanely bearish.,2022-04-07T20:17:28Z
$ZIM interesting close. She was doing well 20-30 mins out then ten minutes out she was still green but began to fall quickly high showed a lack of conviction but 2 minutes out that reversed in a mad scramble which pushed it back up again to close over 1% and increased with after hours. I saw two orders fill 2and 3% higher in the fading seconds as well. So overall pretty good and 3 times higher than the market performed today. We don‚Äôt need big swings just yet as we repair the technical damage and we don‚Äôt need to attract the day traders. Nice easy grind to $65 would be nice before the acceleration.,2022-04-07T20:09:06Z
$ZIM According to DividenMax there&#39;s a $5 interim dividend scheduled for late June :-),2022-04-07T19:53:44Z

Order rates? Off the charts. 
 
********************************************* 
 
The demand for Asian cargoes is likely to rebound as and when the market turns towards the peak season, which historically begins in July. Some sources report that order projections are already well above past years, while carrier sources note strong volume projections for May onwards. This means that an early start to the peak import rush in the US could be on the way.

First the China shutdown produces a lull...then kaboom. 
 
********************************** 
 
Meanwhile, factory and logistics activity in Shanghai has been slashed further with the entire population of 25 million sheltering in place after authorities indefinitely extended a quarantine mandate that was supposed to end Tuesday morning.  
 
Monroe, who heads an eponymous supply chain consulting firm, and other analysts warn that U.S. and European ports are likely to experience a lull in inbound cargo, followed by a huge surge that exacerbates existing congestion. 
 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably worse than Wuhan,‚Äù he told FreightWaves. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to have a lot of pent-up orders. It‚Äôs going to be an overwhelming movement of goods‚Äù that will swamp ocean shipping lines and ports once the lockdowns are lifted, jacking up freight rates even more.

Freight rates slipping? Balderdash!

Bruce Whitfield interviews the Cargo Compass CEO on The Money Show. 
 
We&#39;ve come through a very difficult time with Covid... We were certainly hoping that this year we would start to see it ease off but in fact it has not eased off. 
 
Sebastiano Iorio, CEO - Cargo Compass SA 
We&#39;ve seen that the congestion and delays are continuously growing... Transit times to SA from Europe, the USA and China are continuously rising... 
 
Shipping lines are also increasing freight rates to the point where it impacts the consumer. 
 
Importers are paying more to get goods to our shores; in fact the costs have skyrocketed he says. 
 
Two years ago the basic Shanghai to Durban or Cape Town [12-metre container cost] would have been in the region of $2,000, quite a decent price. Today we are facing, for the same container and slower transit times, anything in the region of about $14,000 for that container.

$ZIM Q1 and Q2 Earnings Forecast 
 
On $ZIM&#39;s Q4 2021 earnings conference call, both there CEO and CFO said that Q1 2022 would look like, but be better, than Q4 2021.  At the time of the call, the quarter was almost over and they knew where their results were.  The quarter only had 3 weeks left in it. 
 
The big surprise for Q2 will be increased volume and rate efficiency caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  A significant amount of cargo used to go from Asia to Europe through Russia.  Since Russia has been sanctioned, all of this cargo has been diverted to sea freight.  Zim&#39;s vessels have been sailing at faster speeds, and working at breakneck paces in loading and unloading to keep up with this increase in demand in Q2.  The war will likely continue (at least through the end of Q2 - June 30) and on their May conference call (when they announce record Q1 results and a large dividend) they will also provide impressive guidance for Q2.,2022-04-07T19:28:30Z
