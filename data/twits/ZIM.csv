$ZIM It&#39;s beautiful how Hapag-Lloyd is going for the new ath again and again and we are here with manipulated ZIM, but I still have hope we will keep up with H-L,2022-05-02T18:20:34Z

$ZIM I have a strange feeling this year dividend will be revised and higher than 2021 or same plus a buyback. We will see but this feeling is based on a high expectation on massive gains in 2022 above guidance.,2022-05-02T16:27:46Z

The year is almost a third over, and with each passing month, shipping lines look increasingly likely to pocket even more cash in 2022 than in record-trouncing 2021.

$ZIM the shorters will close their positions and this will rally few weeks before the ex dividends day,2022-05-02T15:01:11Z
$ZIM Odds they will announce a buyback during their earnings release in May?  I&#39;m guessing 33% chance.   If so, will be rocket fuel for the price.,2022-05-02T14:53:37Z
$ZIM every morning in pre market people try to manipulate this stock down and every afternoon the thing climbs back up like a soldier.  This thing cannot be held down much longer.  
 
This is a very heavily manipulated stock.  
 
The swing traders rape this stock daily. Selling off before closing with 1-2% profit per day.  
 
Just everyone hold it for a week and see what happens guys...,2022-05-02T14:03:33Z
