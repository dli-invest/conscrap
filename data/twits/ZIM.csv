$ZIM Recent posts by Bears using personal attacks against management and half-truths to try and scare people into selling so that they can squeeze a few more pennies out of their short positions shows how desperate they getting.  RSI at 24 and Bollinger Bandwith at 60 shows were at the peak of this selling.  Were all here because we did the DD and know its worth.  Shareholder Equity now higher than market cap.  Don&#39;t give away your shares to these opportunist shorts. They will have to cover very soon.,2022-09-07T04:20:22Z

$ZIM You better donate your money to management sitting in Israel, they love stealing everything. Keep going all the way down to under IPO price. Would be nice if this goes bankrupt by giving dividends to brain dead retail sheep.,2022-09-07T04:02:26Z

On the other hand, besides that opinion on an 80% drp, here&#39;s another look:

McCown is considerably more bullish than some market analysts on where container shipping profitability is headed ‚Äì on 1 September Seatrade Maritime News reported HSBC Global Research‚Äôs Parash Jain forecasting an 80% drop in profitability for the sector in 2023/24.

On the basis of a $245bn forecast for 2022 as whole McCown sees second half profit being $122.6bn very marginally higher than $122.4bn in H1, with Q3 expected to be as good as or slightly better than Q2.

‚ÄúMuch is already baked in for the 2022 financial results and concern on the impact of the orderbook is overdone when the form of new capacity is examined,‚Äù McCown said.

$ZIM this a f‚Äôin joke so many bears around here I‚Äôm loading the boat,2022-09-07T00:42:35Z
$ZIM Everyone keeps talking about how the current profitability won&#39;t last, however forward P/E for 2023 is projected at 2.77.  That&#39;s still insanely profitable.  Simply shorts taking advantage of the temporary post dividend drop.,2022-09-06T22:52:22Z
$ZIM if this gets below $30 25-28, I doubt it will get there but hell if it does I‚Äôm going to take my 5,300 q2 dividends after 25% tax a buy more ZIM. Hadn‚Äôt planned to do that but damn way to cheap below 30,2022-09-06T21:55:05Z

$ZIM train passed in 2021 and 2022 with EPS of $40 and distributing nearly 50% in dividends. Those who invested at $11 ish a share hit the jackpot.  Earnings will now decline to $13 in 2023 and then $5 in 2024. So best case scenario it&#39;s a 7-8 annual dividend and then 2-3 in 2024. What you make in dividends is likely to be lost by the share depreciation. For me it became a value trap, literally.,2022-09-06T20:27:35Z
$ZIM I think this is a longs squeeze, it&#39;s time for the short squeeze.,2022-09-06T20:24:02Z
$ZIM omg dividend must be at risk,2022-09-06T20:12:59Z
$ZIM added at 36. Will add some more if we get under 30. Everyone thinks container rates will callaspe. Do the opposite. Just position yourself for the turn around and enjoy all the dividends along the way,2022-09-06T20:06:37Z
