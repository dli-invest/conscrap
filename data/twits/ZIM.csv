$ZIM $GSL  
 
From the GSL CEO: 
 
This current market has proven to be more resilient than many initially expected, driven by both, continued underlying demand and by supply chain condition that has proven to be more structural than transitory. 
 
Freight and charter markets remain very strong. Liners are forecasting another exceptional year of earnings in 2022. Further, a demand-side spike is expected when China loosens its COVID restrictions, which should have a very positive effect on earnings for the industry.,2022-05-09T21:33:03Z

Port congestion may lift booming container ship market even higher, Global Ship Lease says 
Higher rates have the container ship owner holding off on further acquisitions, executive chairman George Youroukos says,2022-05-09T20:58:11Z
$ZIM  
 
Executives of Triton International (NYSE: TRTN), the world‚Äôs largest container-leasing company, said on a conference call Tuesday that box production is down, new container pricing is down, leasing durations and leasing rates are down, and the pricing of older containers in the secondary market is down. 
 
Down ‚Äî but still higher than in any previous year except 2021. 
 
‚ÄúWhen we look at the market, we say, boy, this is actually a pretty nice market,‚Äù said Brian Sondey, CEO of Triton. ‚ÄúIf you had transported us from 2015 to here, this would be unbelievable. But compared to unprecedented shortages and unprecedented pricing last year, it‚Äôs down a little bit.‚Äù 
 
Sondey described last year as ‚Äúan extreme container shortage‚Äù and the current market as ‚Äústill pretty tight‚Äù but ‚Äúnot quite as extraordinary as 2021‚Äù and ‚Äúmore of a regular market.‚Äù

$ZIM $BTU $UN  
 
My shipping, coal and natty compatriots. The market finished on the low, you know what that means for tomorrow&#39;s opening.... more pain. 
 
As I see it our biggest POTENTIAL source of relief, and I do say POTENTIAL, is the CPI numbers coming out 8:30 EST Wednesday morning.  
 
The only other POTENTIAL relief I see is Shanghai opening up their economy, or one of our fairy godmothers floating in to save us from further damage.,2022-05-09T20:34:12Z
