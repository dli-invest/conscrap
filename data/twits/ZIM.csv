$ZIM I completely understand people taking profits here but it broke the 50dma on Monday and the 8dma crossed the 50dma today on a huge order after close. Ex-dividend in 3 days. I think we could see $77 by EOW.,2022-05-25T05:38:35Z
$ZIM: Both the short term and long term trends are positive. This is a very positive sign. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/ZIM/technical-analysis?key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=TA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-05-25T04:36:00Z
$ZIM if market would just be green for 3-4 straight days this thing will be in the 80s in no time but that seems impossible these days,2022-05-25T02:33:15Z
$SBLK crushed earnings and goes up...When $zim and $grin crushed they went down. Zims already back up though.  So I am assuming SBLK going to 40 this week since they will just rise and dont need a recovery after earnings.,2022-05-25T02:04:24Z
$ZIM gonna close above 66 on Friday?,2022-05-25T02:04:17Z

$ZIM congrats long. I decide to raise more cash to play potential face ripping rally (if happen soon I will UDOW) and add to my QLD through nibbling on down days. ZIM fully recover IMO.,2022-05-24T23:26:30Z

$ZIM Great day!  In my view just as important as yesterday.  Today was proving that this wasn&#39;t a quick bounce on positive news, rather the true value of this company is yet to be seen.  It&#39;s good now to stay patient.  Anything above $70 this week is a win.  Then we can expect above $80 by end of June.,2022-05-24T19:52:15Z

What if Asia-Europe trade demand decreases in June and July (and possibly longer), as inflation and recessionary trends take hold? Again, Drewry does not expect a collapse in spot freight rates, because blank sailings will adjust effective supply and reduce the swings in spot rates........ 
 
 Freight rates have not only become harder to forecast, but they are also becoming a more important topic in the boardrooms of many companies.
