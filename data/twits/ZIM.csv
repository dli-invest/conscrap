$ZIM wonder if profits of the&quot; zim bank&quot;  will show .,2023-03-08T19:11:11Z
$ZIM Seems the common theme of people attempting to cast doubt on the upcoming dividend amount is to consistently talk about the looming projected forecasts of the upcoming years.

The problem I have with this, is they refuse to acknowledge any positive outlooks of expanded growth in new revenue streams, how the Israelis tax system plays a function in determining dividends. It&#39;s all doom &amp; gloom while ignoring the details that matter.

I&#39;ve started to look into the matter. I do not know if any annual tax records are publicly available for ZIM. I am unsure of exactly how the system operates there to date, but I have uncovered several interesting details that could factor in the operations of ZIM as well as play a part in determining the annual dividend for ZIM.

If anyone has any helpful or beneficial knowledge to share on this topic, feel free to share.

(ZIM top-up expectations 2 or 2)  
 
This is exactly why it is more logical to expect a top-up amount of a maximum 5%-10%. Which, based on the more accurate external consensus estimates as well as the decreasing direction of internal guidance on EPS of $2.26, would be a pretax amount at between $2.54 - $4.42 (with 25% foreign dividend withholding tax a net of $1.91-3.32).   
 
Expecting even a dollar above this amount is just plain irresponsible.  It could be as low as 66 cents if they forgo any top-up.,2023-03-08T17:59:45Z

(ZIM top-up expectations 1 or 2)  
 
Seems like some inexperienced traders here are ignoring the reasons as to why there isnâ€™t a flat 50% quarterly dividend payment. It is for FLEXIBILITY!  
 
Obviously 1/2 of EPS quarterly would be preferable for small-time shareholders but the company doesnâ€™t care about random and insignificant retail investors. They are in the business of increasing shareholder value long term across all 120+M shares, including the major holders. And so allowing some flexibility in payments between the 30% to 50% (0-20% yearâ€™s end) of earnings obviously provides improved flexibility.  
 
This is particularly important in cases such as now when the firm is facing the real possibility of two years of negative net income (according to consensus estimates).  Ask yourself why they would institute an OPTIONAL top-up. Because there will be times when it does not make good business sense to pay out the full, or even the partial top-up %. This is one of those times.,2023-03-08T17:59:24Z

@James_giant_eggplant Based on recent reporting by Hapag-Lloyd of record earnings in 2022, including Q4, I doubt we&#39;ll see a major dividend cut on Monday. However, I do agree that the next two years will be very challenging for all container shippers and the &quot;nimble&quot; model for $ZIM will likely be put to a defining test. In the meantime, the many crossover issues (Ukraine war, Russian sanctions, China&#39;s economy, natural disasters, etc.) will continue to challenge all analyses. With so many moving variables to consider, any forecast could be  rendered obsolete before the proverbial ink dries. JMHO,2023-03-08T16:04:14Z
