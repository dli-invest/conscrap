CH Robinson singing a familiar song: 
 
US-based logistics provider C.H. Robinson expects global ocean freight rates for container ships to remain elevated through 2022 as the holiday peak season begins, the company said during its first quarter earnings call. 
 
The company indicated that, while volumes had waned amid hampered production capacity in China, there was a strong likelihood for an increase in booking activity as Chinese production facilities come online, which would serve to keep freight rates elevated. 
 
‚ÄúCovid lockdowns in China have reduced [production],‚Äù C.H Robinson CEO Robert Biesterfeld said April 27. ‚ÄúWe expect some pent-up demand when China fully reopens.‚Äù

$ZIM at a certain point, does shipping congestion switch from being a boon for shippers to being a killer? Like is it possible that shippers eventually price out businesses -&gt; they have to shut down or decrease production -&gt; supply vanishes?

Obviously doesn&#39;t seem like we are anywhere near that but it seems like at a certain point that could be possible. 

Someone sanity check me here.,2022-05-04T17:58:49Z
