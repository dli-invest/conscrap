So many uninformed and delusions posters. It would be hilarious if it was so sad. Everyone just jumped on board chasing a dividend yield that was only accurate for the exceptional situation of the past two years and won’t ever return to this firm.  
 
Watch the price dive when the earnings come out in line with expectations at 2.00-2.50EPS for Q4 with low guidance for 2023. The dividend will be substantially lower than the pipe dream numbers people have been throwing around here lately and the price will fall. 
 
People holding bags will sell at any price as the dividend yield will be terrible moving forward thanks to the low expected earnings compared to 2021/22.  
 
Anyone with a shred of trading experience will likely sell prior to the ex-div date anyway to avoid the 25% withholding tax on foreign dividends. Good luck getting that back as it is a song and a dance and even Schwab describes the 1116 form as “complex and complicated”. Search google for those instructions.,2023-02-27T19:22:34Z

Divvy probably in the $8 range…..ticker price doesn’t matter if your long and not taking profits.,2023-02-27T16:03:22Z
$ZIM do you think anyone actually *wants* the 25% foreign witholding tax credit? Does that benefit anyone like foreigners who have even higher domestic tax rates?  
 
It&#39;s doesn&#39;t help me it&#39;s money lost forever to me. I would rather sell the week of EX try to get out as high as possible and then buy it back after EX cheaper and buy more shares. Every time doing this you don&#39;t collect any dividend but you get more shares every repurchase.  
 
 
The problem is, if everyone is doing this it crashes the price right before EX day then everyone is playing hot potato trying to get out in time.  
 
But if there is actually anyone who wants to collect the dividend?  
 
Dividend snipers please take my shares I don&#39;t want the dividend.,2023-02-27T15:40:06Z
$ZIM everything in my news feed is telling me how bad ZIM is. Sponsored articles mind you.  
 
I think I need $35 to break even.  
 
Even though my DCA is 45 or something because of tge dividends, I bought more shares, so I don&#39;t need 45 to break even. I need 35 with more shares then when I started.  
 
Eventually with dividends the price if the stock could be $5 in 2 years but I made back all my money on dividends.  
 
But the more likely scenario is by 2026 this stock is over $100 share and I bought 4x as many shares using dividend money first.,2023-02-27T15:33:38Z
