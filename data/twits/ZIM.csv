$ZIM So, the Zolmax article (see sidebar) predicts EPS around $6 for 2023. This implies a predicted reduction in revenue by about 85% relative to this year, which means slashing the currently declined freight rates by another 50% or so. I don&#39;t think this will happen. 
 
We won&#39;t know for sure until next earnings what the new normal effective freight rates are for ZIM. Until then, the &quot;market makers&quot; can twist your portfolio back and forth like a nose of wax. Be careful not to over-react.,2022-11-22T19:46:27Z
