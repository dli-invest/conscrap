$ZIM Next week is looking good,2022-03-26T20:55:23Z
$ZIM Let&#39;s listen to the experts: 
 
1. Jerome Powell sees a very strong US economy, no recession, salaries and employment up. 
 
2. James Bullard, St. Louis fed President, is saying pricing power with the vendors, and that supply chains issues are here for 2022 at least. 
 
3. Jefferies transportation analyst targets $ZIM fair value at $120. And he‚Äôs 5* and at the top 5% of Tipranks. 
 
4. EIi Glickman‚Äôs guidance is very good. 
 
5. $ZIM financials say Oil makes 18% of operation expenses (so, 10% increase is 2% in expenses) And Oil was in the sky when ZIM‚Äôs guidance was posted. They are conservatives, they probably haven‚Äôt anticipated a $80 a barrel. 
 
6. UNCTAD says 1.5 million containers will be rerouted from Railways that pass through Russia to see causing a container pricing surge.  Warning that TEU &amp; FEU will be higher than 2021 highs. 
 
All of these people get their salaries not just for bottom lines, but also for predictions and accuracy.,2022-03-26T20:44:51Z

Foreign Tire Sales Inc., based in New Jersey and founded by Richard Kuskin, says Evergreen and other global ocean freight carriers have ‚Äúunjustly and unreasonably exploited customers ‚Ä¶ by substantially increasing their profits‚Äù at the expense of their customers, and at the expense of the American public ‚Äúwhich has been forced to absorb higher product prices.‚Äù 
 
Foreign Tire Sales filed its complaint with the Federal Maritime Commission on March 18th. The tire importer, which offers the Otani and ProMeter brands, says it had a service contract with Evergreen to provide shipping services from May 1, 2021, through April 30, 2022.

$ZIM the global food shortage will require more ocean containers to be shipped to many countries. The demand is not going anywhere and with inflation everyone will want to protect themselves. Thus, rates are not going down while everything around is expensive. Ocean rate will go down when other rates will go down which means never!,2022-03-26T02:47:01Z
