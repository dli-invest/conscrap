$ZIM Just a reminder to those new to ZIM that nobody really knows what the future holds, but there is no reason to suppose that things won&#39;t perk up.  
 
You must not pay attention to pundits who claim otherwise. Henrik Alex on Seeking Alpha (18/12/22) expected share prices to &quot;fall even further&quot; and the dividend to be &quot;cancelled&quot;. Sam Bland of JP Morgan (13/1/23) gave a price target of $17.60. The accuracy of his calls over time has been 53%, only 3% better than my cat. (When I asked him should I sell, he said &quot;Niao&quot;.) 
 
The only way to satisfy yourself that all is in order is to examine the financial reports. Future results will no doubt differ from the past. But remember that even the best of the pundits is making a guess about the future based on these reports. 
 
Who is the best of the pundits? Why, Scott of course. I hope he gets around to doing another piece on ZIM. The last one (9 months ago) is still worth a watch.
