Looks like I can get the dividend tax down to 15% for sure and maybe 5% but that doesn&#39;t sound applicable,2022-11-25T19:39:39Z

Look at all the retailers on here shorting saying price is going to crash into Monday.  Why do I think we burn these retailers?  They missed there short opportunity and are going to get burned,2022-11-25T18:13:44Z
$ZIM so is this going to go down over time ? are we supposed to make money with dividends only with this stock ?,2022-11-25T18:13:11Z
$ZIM that‚Äôs it‚Äôs 25.67 closing price. Open Monday at 22.72,2022-11-25T18:00:45Z
$ZIM I will take the dividend and buy more ZIM as I want the 30 percent dividend next quarter.  Even after the dividend ZIM has 4 billion in cash and a 3 billion market cap,2022-11-25T17:58:11Z
$ZIM bought and wait for more month like $BPT,2022-11-25T17:54:56Z
$ZIM SP manipulation, as usual,2022-11-25T17:34:33Z
$ZIM you could buy ZIM right now and hold until Monday and get a 10 percent dividend. Isn‚Äôt that crazy. What a nut bar market,2022-11-25T17:20:15Z
$ZIM out at 26, will buy back later,2022-11-25T17:09:51Z
$ZIM I think: buy and hold. I bought in at $23.47. The dividend this time is $2.21 after the Israeli tax. The next dividend is $6 to $7.50+ after the Israeli tax. The company has no debt and $3B in cash. Its P.E. is under 1. The larger economy may be rocky, and shorts may continue to reduce the SP, but routes may open up, and a whole country (Israel) has ZIM&#39;s back. So, while I feel it is a risk, due to what the larger economy might due, there is also a chance at this stock could rise 10 to 50% by summer. 
 
Would love to hear other people&#39;s reasoning.,2022-11-25T16:56:26Z

$ZIM So let&#39;s assume ZIM will keep dropping as much as the dividend it gives out for the next 2 quarters. ZIM will give out $13 pre-tax, which will drop its price to around $13 in this scenario. ZIM will have ~$40 per share in net cash at the end of the year (got to account for its leases in the liabilities part of the balance sheet), so market is pricing in that ZIM will perpetually burn through cash. Looking at the income statement pre-covid, ZIM was mostly profitable even when it was leveraged to the teeth. Now ZIM has almost 0 debt, and is earning interest instead on its interest earning investments. So even if we return to pre-covid shipping rates, ZIM will most likely be profitable.,2022-11-25T16:20:06Z
$ZIM why many people sold?,2022-11-25T16:18:09Z
$ZIM do you share holders realize 40-50 percent of the shipping ZIM does is Europe too North America?  Why the obsession of posters with just China stuff. Cheat lie and steal is the new way of investing these days,2022-11-25T16:13:16Z
Container ship rates from China continue to fall

$ZIM If you bought 5,000 shares at $23.47, under what circumstances would you sell ZIM? I think you remain bullish on this stock, @MisterOldManInvestor .,2022-11-25T15:54:06Z
