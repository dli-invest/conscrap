$DAC Let&#39;s be honest, the future is looking brighter for Dac, but the report should just make people bullish on $ZIM,2022-05-16T21:58:28Z
$DAC sold 1.5 million shares of $ZIM in April, after the dividend. Huge net income from operations, plus the pile of money they made from dividends and shares proceedings. A but disappointing they kept dividend at $.75/share and did not announce any buyback (so far, we&#39;ll see the earnings call).,2022-05-16T21:14:58Z

People who trade $ZIM, $LPG, can you rain on my parade and help me understand why PSHG wouldn’t be in line to do the same exact thing these shippers did in continuing to pay large special dividends as they’re so cash flow positive?  It’s in PSHG bylaws that if they’re cash flow positive they’ll likely pay a dividend.  So I need someone to hold back as many insults as possible (but I’ll take a few if it’ll lead me to learning something!), but tell me why PSHG isn’t similar to these other dividend darlings and paying out dividends atm? 

For now I’m still betting on patience, holding plenty of PSHG and LPG (keeping it for the next dividend too 😘),2022-05-16T18:23:56Z

$ZIM the bearish argument here is that with China locked downs increases the chances of a global recession, so lower guidance or disappointing months ahead.  But Im more inclined to the Bullish side here still.,2022-05-16T18:00:04Z
