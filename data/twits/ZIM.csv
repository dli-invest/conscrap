The Price/Earnings Ratio is 1.32, which indicates a rather cheap valuation of $ZIM. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/analyzer/stock/ZIM?view=fundamental-analysis&amp;key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-04-26T00:04:00Z
$ZIM Like most shipping stocks, ZIM is extremely volatile - and with uncertainty from China, that volatility is swinging downward. 
 
However, shipping stocks also tend to have fast, huge upswings. Both $ZIM &amp; $MATX are at a massive discount. Doesn&#39;t mean there won&#39;t be more downward movement, doesn&#39;t mean an upswing will happen this week or next - but these are very solid companies that will see sharp increases at some point,2022-04-25T23:40:56Z
$ZIM I think tomorrow will largely depend on how China recovers (or doesn&#39;t) overnight. If it does, we&#39;re seeing +xx%, if not we may be in a bit of trouble lads,2022-04-25T23:22:50Z

$ZIM how in fucking hell do I own a stock with these fundamentals and wake up in a cold sweat wondering how much more it will sell off and I will be underwater? PE of 1.3, market cap less than revenue, cash generating machine, etc., and it all counts for dick all nothing. Unreal. I have the anti midas touch. Everyone got rich on friggin AMC and GME and I&#39;m holding the bag here.,2022-04-25T22:21:42Z
$ZIM Just grabbing my ankles and holding on for dear life while getting pounded by this biatch.....still!,2022-04-25T22:20:19Z
$ZIM Should be trading in the ~$60 range by the end of the week, if this drop had any fundamentals it wouldn&#39;t have recovered so well by the end of the day.,2022-04-25T21:36:15Z

$ZIM gotta give props to @MonkeyBananaGenius who nailed the short on this one,2022-04-25T19:32:17Z
$ZIM Couldn‚Äôt resist, had to add more! Honestly, I thought I‚Äôll never be able to by this under $60, once I sold a big part at $58 and $ZIM just kept running. Now been buying small amounts since the fall to $61, the company is financially healthy and seems to be able to stay stable for years to come and great dividends too on top of that!,2022-04-25T19:29:57Z
