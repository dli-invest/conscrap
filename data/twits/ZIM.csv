$ZIM seems like a no brainer for management to do a $3.50+ dividend based on how they had to do a $17 div in 4Q&#39;21 to catch up to their policy of returning a set % of earnings to shareholders given how freight rates remained elevated YoY.,2022-05-18T05:05:21Z

Container ship shortage will provide a firm floor!,2022-05-17T22:12:18Z

Container shipping rates: Still sky high but falling back to Earth 
Asia-US container shipping indexes down around 20%-30% from peaks 
 
Weakness in the Asia-West Coast trade is now showing up in the Freightos Baltic Daily Index (FBX). This mirrors the trend previously shown by the weekly Drewry World Container Index. 
 
Between May 2 and May 11, the FBX Asia-West Coast assessment — which includes premium charges — sank 25% to $12,217 per FEU. It subsequently rose to $13,806 per FEU as of Friday. But even so, Friday’s rate was down 33% from the lane’s all-time high in late September. 
 
The Drewry Shanghai-Los Angeles assessment, which doesn’t include premiums, was down to $8,666 per FEU as of last week. 
 
That’s 23% below levels in the third week of January and 30% below the index’s late-September record.

First company to shout FIRE just reported. 
 
Hapag-Lloyd is raining on the parade. Could be why $DAC dove today also on improved earnings. 
 
Asked about this possibility, the Hapag-Lloyd CFO answered: “Could we see a rebound out of China after China opens and everything is normal? Yes and no. Yes, when China reopens again there will be some rebound. But overall, we have to accept that demand is going down over time.” In other words, falling demand could offset some of the gains from China’s reopening and peak season.

Another risk for OEMs and their transport providers is the backlash on the logistics infrastructure when Shanghai finally ends all lockdown restrictions and manufacturing returns to normal. Recalling the first Covid lockdown in 2020, Damas reminded delegates that Shanghai stopped for a few weeks and then surged with volumes on reopening. “At that point the transport system couldn’t cope,” he said. “It is either a demand or supply shock. Be prepared for a production catch up in Q3 and at that point there will be further pressure on available shipping capacity.”

Shipping Stocks Backdrop 
Other shipping stocks also have strong ratings, after the pandemic shutdowns created hiccups in flow of goods from factories to ports to warehouses and store shelves. Shipping costs soared as container ships backed up outside ports and available containers and ships to load with new products became hard to find. 
 
This year, however, the run higher for many shipping stocks has cooled off. Freight rates have eased from recent highs.   
 
Shipping operators also ordered more ships in an effort to ride rising container-freight rates to greater profit. That expanded fleet could eventually push freight rates lower, offering some relief to businesses who have had to pay thousands for a single container shipment. Lower rates would also threaten profits for shipping stocks. 
 
However, it can take years before new ship orders arrive. In the near term, supply disruptions from Russia&#39;s war and a reopening of China&#39;s economy could well keep rates elevated.,2022-05-17T21:15:27Z

$ZIM PhD prediction: earnings under perform relative to market expectation of a blow out. Practically all Q2 has been subject to China lockdowns so guidance is going to be negative from management for Q2 as well. Sell off today was from smart institutions and money managers. All the fundamental talk is strictly amongst retail sheep who don&#39;t realize if the market thought this was a 3-4 PE, it would be a 3 to 4 PE. MARK THIS POST. 57 PT TOMORROW.,2022-05-17T19:56:49Z
