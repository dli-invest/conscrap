$ZIM stressed by the drop,2022-03-27T22:14:07Z
$ZIM at least according to simply wall st...,2022-03-27T19:56:55Z
$ZIM i really hope those ppl who claim it go 50 or 40 to post why it will. 
 
unless something Israel goes war or some unprecedent situation occur like COVID-19.  
 
really can&#39;t see why it will go to 50 or 40. 
 
industrial avg is 4-5 PE.  
 
ZIM is 1.7 PE. 
 
ZIM is clearly lagging behind greatly after posting a very positive ER last Quarter.,2022-03-27T19:19:54Z
$ZIM So to many investors this seems like a value trap, but with 2020 marking the beginning of a shipping supercycle that some are predicting to last many years to come, I think the market will slowly reward all the shipper stocks handsomely as they see freight rates do not abate and oil starts its retreat back to sub $80 by the summer. We could potentially see a PE of 6 on Zim , putting it roughly around $210. 
 
Obviously there are some short term headwinds like oil reaching even higher prices, logistical mishaps, thoughts?,2022-03-27T18:57:23Z

$ZIM starting to think tomorrow is going to be a critical day for this stock. 

Will it recover quickly as it has in the past, or slowly over the next few months‚Ä¶?

Bullish either way.,2022-03-27T16:51:18Z

$ZIM Why the global supply chains will never fully recover, and container ship rates will remain high (A WSJ Documentary released March 23, 2022).  $ZIM $DAC $KEN revenue and earnings will only continue to rise year over year at a rapidly increasing rate.  The leveling off that some analyst are predicting will never be realized.

$ZIM Next week is looking good,2022-03-26T20:55:23Z
$ZIM Let&#39;s listen to the experts: 
 
1. Jerome Powell sees a very strong US economy, no recession, salaries and employment up. 
 
2. James Bullard, St. Louis fed President, is saying pricing power with the vendors, and that supply chains issues are here for 2022 at least. 
 
3. Jefferies transportation analyst targets $ZIM fair value at $120. And he‚Äôs 5* and at the top 5% of Tipranks. 
 
4. EIi Glickman‚Äôs guidance is very good. 
 
5. $ZIM financials say Oil makes 18% of operation expenses (so, 10% increase is 2% in expenses) And Oil was in the sky when ZIM‚Äôs guidance was posted. They are conservatives, they probably haven‚Äôt anticipated a $80 a barrel. 
 
6. UNCTAD says 1.5 million containers will be rerouted from Railways that pass through Russia to see causing a container pricing surge.  Warning that TEU &amp; FEU will be higher than 2021 highs. 
 
All of these people get their salaries not just for bottom lines, but also for predictions and accuracy.,2022-03-26T20:44:51Z

Foreign Tire Sales Inc., based in New Jersey and founded by Richard Kuskin, says Evergreen and other global ocean freight carriers have ‚Äúunjustly and unreasonably exploited customers ‚Ä¶ by substantially increasing their profits‚Äù at the expense of their customers, and at the expense of the American public ‚Äúwhich has been forced to absorb higher product prices.‚Äù 
 
Foreign Tire Sales filed its complaint with the Federal Maritime Commission on March 18th. The tire importer, which offers the Otani and ProMeter brands, says it had a service contract with Evergreen to provide shipping services from May 1, 2021, through April 30, 2022.
