$ZIM imagine if u invested in ZIM at IPO $10. u have already collect 2 years worth of dividend where all your capital has been returned to you. 
 
therefore stay vested in ZIM is the best to protect your capital and against Fed rate hike and fight against inflation.

$ZIM So glad to be back in the game. Sold all shares after prices were pummelling off the ATH, and bought again recently. 
 
What a nice daily chart that is! 
 
&lt;rant&gt;The only annoying thing about it (or rather ST) is the constant whining about dividends... Jesus, before you invest your own money, do your DD, ffs. &lt;/rant&gt;,2022-03-29T19:40:28Z
$ZIM we should see 80 + next week,2022-03-29T19:18:23Z
$ZIM 2% up but if you bought at open it’s 6% up!!!,2022-03-29T19:13:06Z
$ZIM hope transport cost go up more. since i am vested in shipping line and since inflation wont drop. may it blow up higher so i get my offset inflation from ZIM,2022-03-29T19:04:59Z
