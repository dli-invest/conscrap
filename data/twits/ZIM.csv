South Korea&#39;s largest container shipper just reported: 
 
HMM‚Äôs net profit surged 1,932.8 percent on year to 3.13 trillion won ($2.4 billion) in the first quarter, beating market expectations as shipping fees soared. 
 
The figure was higher than FnGuide‚Äôs market consensus of 2.49 trillion won. 
 
It logged revenue of 4.92 trillion won, up 102.6 percent on year. Operating profit jumped 208.9 percent to 3.15 trillion won. Both exceeded market expectations and are record high figures. 
 
HMM said its profit and revenue soared as freight charges rose for most of the routes it ships to, especially those connecting the United States and Europe. 
 
The Shanghai Containerized Freight Index, which indicates sea freight rates of cargo shipments, rose 74.5 percent on year to an average 4,851 points in the first quarter.

$DAC from the FY2018 10K report - DAC took a combined $626M in impairment losses in FY2016 and FY2018, primarily on vessels. I haven&#39;t looked in-depth as to whether DAC still owns all of these ships, but it seems likely that DAC book value of PPE / assets / equity are understated 
 
using balance sheet values from the FY2021 10-K, DAC currently trades at  0.77x book equity. Adjusting for dividends and expected Q1 earnings, I conservatively estimate that DAC is currently trading closer to ~0.68x book equity. if we assume that of this $626M impairment charge, ~$300M (48%) of the impairment was taken ahead of the turnaround in the container / vessel market, DAC is trading at an even further discount to the true economic value of its assets (~0.60x &quot;true&quot; book equity, which is wildly cheap for a company with relatively fixed earnings...) 
 
this also assumes that $ZIM has stayed flat since 12/31/2021 (+12% YTD) :),2022-05-14T13:45:01Z
