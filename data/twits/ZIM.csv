$ZIM This is going to go crazy when they announce their Q4 dividend. I just noticed I&#39;m almost up and still no dividend announcement.,2023-02-10T02:57:43Z
$ZIM  
The beauty of this is that &quot;Four to one&quot; IS &quot;Four to one&quot;. :) The point is that I feel very sorry for all the folks who went &quot;four to one&quot; with HPCO today. All because a &quot;rapper&quot; endorsed a &quot;Dope Company&quot;. Most have not sold yet and the &quot;rug pull&quot; is coming, as it is happening with GNS, slowly but surely. 
ZIM is a real international business. Operated by &quot;Israelis&quot; (YES, Jewish Businessmen) who know how to accomplish significant international goals, etc. 
THE 52 week high last January was about  
$ 98.00. Going &quot;More than four to one&quot; with ZIM will be safer, more assured and therefore, most predictable. :) It is indeed a &quot;nice&quot; feeling to be in good hands of good leadership. :) 
Best to everyone. :),2023-02-10T02:21:14Z
