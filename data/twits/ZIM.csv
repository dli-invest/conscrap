$ZIM ex div date has already passed, sorry shorts there‚Äôs no more free rides down.   Now the pay dates are when investors actually receive the cash and can reinvest their funds and buy stock.  That means millions of buy orders to push the stock higher will hit next week.  Starting on Wednesday I think.  Just think what happens to the average volume when a couple hundred million dollars in buy transactions hit on Wednesday on a slow market day.  Algos will start front running this on Monday you can believe.,2022-12-04T02:37:09Z
$ZIM unbelievable low price ..oh that&#39;s when to buy ...buy and hold wait for Dec 14 see price at $24.50 Cheers,2022-12-03T23:24:44Z
$ZIM If ZIM payed a Special dividend out of retained earnings of $20shr our company would still be more valuable with more money in the bank than when ZIM went public 2 years ago. Bigger, better, stronger in every way!! Fact!!,2022-12-03T22:50:51Z
$ZIM Everyday new low. They should start to buy back. I somehow never trust lsraelis but l am still optimistic.,2022-12-03T22:14:09Z
$ZIM It&#39;s not that difficult to understand were we going.,2022-12-03T20:26:29Z
$ZIM The analyses of ZIM&#39;s prospects remind me of the reactions of teenage girls to people and experiences. Things are either cute or loathsome, with nothing much in between. The need to dramatize, exaggerate is human nature.  
 
Here is an interesting point for debate: benefits of (a) drip vs (b) buybacks.  
 
(a) The company pays dividends that are taxed at 25%, and investors use the remainder to buy N stocks on average that have fallen by x% some time after the ex-div date. 
 
(b) The company buys back N stocks on behalf of investors at the market price. 
 
The apparent breakeven point here is when the stock price falls by 25% after the ex-div date. However, the 25% tax paid is not entirely lost. In both Canada and the US it has value as a tax credit that can be applied to taxable investment returns (the amount will depend on individual circumstances).,2022-12-03T18:49:06Z

$ZIM RE: 
 
COH exceeds MC. $ZIM has a &quot;cash burn&quot; future according to many that have decent knowledge of this sector. That is based on how these sector&#39;s rates are preforming and presume to perform in the medium term. How long will lower rates last is the key point/question in my consideration on holding onto my shares. Unfortunately My $29+ sell order was missed by a few dimes so now I&#39;m left deeper into the RED. I may unload some if we get consolidated rebound &quot;dead cat bounce&quot; if you like. I can always redeploy to another undervalued equity. GL Longs..,2022-12-03T18:09:25Z
$ZIM According to ETrade, my ZIM dividends are not eligible for dividend reinvestment. Anyone know why?,2022-12-03T16:12:42Z

$ZIM How&#39;s my LONG tribe doing today? Strong company with strong fundamentals.  Nice dividend yield, even with the 25% foreign tax scalp. Broken stock, primarily due to non-intristic factors and uncertain external forces causing fear, doubt and more uncertainty, triggering weak hands to sell. Time to buy more attack up for next dividend and rise in share price next year. #LONGTRIBE,2022-12-03T15:53:29Z
$ZIM for all the shorties thinking this will drop for ever, most recent Morningstar fair market value üëá,2022-12-03T14:27:41Z

$ZIM when is dividend pay day?  Buying more of it,2022-12-03T07:26:57Z
$ZIM once they start the combo of dividend + buybacks then the stock will go up.  If they only do dividends and no buyback, then it‚Äôs lopsided and the stock goes no where.,2022-12-03T03:11:11Z
