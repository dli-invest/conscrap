Won‚Äôt these dividends stay fat for Q3 and Q4 since the economic storm is forecasted for 2023 for the most part?,2022-09-17T01:54:23Z
$ZIM I made a bunch in calls riding this up last year but am now waiting until maybe $22-24 to get back in. It may never get there but that&#39;s my target.,2022-09-17T01:51:26Z

$ZIM container going back to 2k,2022-09-16T22:46:01Z
$ZIM  so fed ex announces record low deliveries.  
 
I see this as a repeat of the pandemic which drove up container rates. Same effect different cause.  
 
So you have ports in the USA jammed full of containers because the port is full, warehouses full, stores full. Backs up everything right out to sea.  Ships waiting to unload.  
 
Yes, shippers will stop loading more containers and wait for inventory to clear.  But the whole thing will get backed up right to Asia again first.  And asian ports will be jammed waiting for everything else to clear. Same effect, different cause.,2022-09-16T22:34:42Z
$ZIM market up? Zim down. 
Market down? Zim down?

$ZIM  The last hour of trading today was a harbinger for the end of the short narrative here... I would be surprised to see further significant downside even if the sector, or overall market continues lower... It&#39;s just stupidly cheap here... It seems the market is ignoring the transformation ZIM has made in it&#39;s business model, systems, and platform... Buyers here are going to be richly rewarded for many years going forward... The shorts should be packing their s--- and hitting the road by Monday...,2022-09-16T21:26:30Z

$ZIM elon musk would be talking big time if tsla stock did this crap I sold all my shares pm. can&#39;t handle  any more of this stock.,2022-09-16T17:47:44Z
$ZIM the assumption that dividend will stay at same level. There is basically zero chance for that and honestly if I was the CEO I would stop dividend in 2023 due to do much uncertainty. It is the responsible thing to do for long term. 

My target is $22 -$20 by end of Q1 2023,2022-09-16T17:42:47Z
