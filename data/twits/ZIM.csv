$ZIM was analyzed by 12 analysts. The buy consensus is at 78%. So analysts seem to be mildly confident about $ZIM. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/analyzer/stock/ZIM?view=analyst-ratings&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=ANALYST&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-05-28T06:33:00Z
$ZIM  too much pressure on markets today be careful I fucking love this stock btwüëç,2022-05-28T05:45:35Z
$ZIM I have been thinking about the tax implications of the dividend for Canadian residents. I consider an investment of $100 that gains value of $50 *and* gives $50 of dividend over the same time period (similar ratio to ZIM). I assume 25% for the taxpayer marginal rate. 
 
In a taxable account, you pay capital gains tax of $6.25 plus $12.5 on the divi, for a total of $18.75. 
 
In a RRSP [like US 401k] you pay a whopping $50 in tax on withdrawal, as everything (including $100 principal) is taxed. 
 
In a TFSA [like US Roth IRA] you pay $12.5 in tax (withheld by Israel on the divi). 
 
So, the TFSA is still not too bad, so long as the price of ZIM is rising in line with the divi. You benefit from untaxed capital gains.,2022-05-28T05:23:28Z

 Lack of free tonnage keeps charter market insulated against freight rate falls 
 
While a softening in consumer demand has weakened global freight rates, the containership charter markets are largely insulated, due to the absence of open tonnage and the duration of time charters. 
 
Although there are signs of the red-hot charter market cooling, particularly in the smaller sizes, and some loss of appetite for multi-year fixtures, MSI‚Äôs May Horizon report indicates no immediate signs of major corrections.

Well- looks like zim  will move northward  into next week. Hopefully it continues the buying momentum.  The last dividend was too large and created a serious vacuum for short players to take advantage of. This was a lot easier to absorb.  Maybe Anyone who sold expecting the major shorting might be sorry. We will see after the pay date.,2022-05-27T20:33:20Z
