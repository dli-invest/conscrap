$ZIM First Frank-the-tank, then this fellow below me. Both expressing strong opinions about the character of the ZIM management that are backed up by nothing. Frank does not even know the share count, and I suspect the other fellow is no better informed. 
 
If you want a share buyback, do it yourself while the stock is cheap. By Friday the options action suggest it will be at $20.50, which is where it would have been had the price fallen by the dividend payout. Coincidence? Hardly. 
 
For the record, I look forward to the 2023 guidance, and will base my decisions on that. The 2022 guidance given after Q1 this year proved to be accurate.,2022-12-14T04:50:15Z
$ZIM I wish I could Sue the board. These Fing crooks belong in jail. They should have been buying back shares for months now! The major insiders just pocketed their massive dividends and couldn‚Äôt care less about the rest of since since they got their shares for nothing. I‚Äôll never buy another Israeli company again.,2022-12-14T03:47:43Z

HOWEVER, amidst all the bad news: 
 
Easing fuel prices are removing some pressure on container rates, according to a report from Judah Levine, head of research for Freightos, and the U.S. East Coast has still booked gains versus the pre-Covid market as more Asian trade has shifted there. While Asia-U.S. West Coast rates are now at a level 5% lower than in 2019, Asia-U.S. East Coast rates are still 32% higher than three years ago.,2022-12-13T20:02:12Z

HOWEVER. 
 
PAY ATTENTION TO THE LAST SENTENCE 
 
‚ÄúIn 2023, there is a high possibility of an all-out price war,‚Äù Roeloffs said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt seem that the capacity restrictions that we have seen in the past two years are due to return, so we‚Äôll just have ample capacity both on the vessel as well as on the container side. With the competitive dynamics in the container shipping and liner industry, I don‚Äôt expect especially the big players to hold back, and we do expect prices to come down to almost variable costs. We also foresee market consolidation.‚Äù,2022-12-13T20:01:18Z

Asia-U.S. West Coast prices (FBX01 Weekly) fell 26% to $1,426/FEU. This rate is 90% lower than the same time last year. 
Asia-U.S. East Coast prices (FBX03 Weekly) decreased 19% to $3,723/FEU, and are 78% lower than rates for this week last year.

The ocean freight contract market tracked by Xeneta‚Äôs global XSI recorded a drop of 5.7% in November, the third month in a row rates have dropped, and the largest month-over-month decline recorded since the launch of the XSI in 2019, according to Peter Sand, chief analyst at Xeneta. ‚ÄúFor many carriers, the fall in the XSI will trigger the fall in their average rates and will bring an end to record-breaking quarters,‚Äù he said. 
 
Sand expects the challenging environment to continue given the 40 percent drop in Chinese manufacturing orders and logistics managers expecting demand normalization to not occur until next summer. 
 
The change from a supply chain that struggled in trying to keep up with unprecedented pandemic demand to a weak demand environment and freight market now oversupplied with both ships and containers highlights the risk of a prolonged downturn in the global economy. Central banks across the world are raising interest rates to fight inflation.,2022-12-13T19:58:37Z

Logistics managers are sending the message to clients that the ocean freight market is correcting itself at a faster pace than anticipated. 
 
Shipping firm HLS recently wrote to clients, ‚ÄúWe initially expected the market was about to correct itself and normalize some time in 2023, but it comes much earlier than we expected.‚Äù 
 
The peak in the market, according to Alan Baer, CEO of OL USA, was the second quarter. ‚ÄúFrom there a steady decline,‚Äù Baer said. The market may have reached the low point in November, he said, but added, ‚Äúit is still too early to tell if this is a trend.‚Äù  
 
Despite the spot market collapse, the major shipping lines reported nearly $122 billion in profits over the first three quarters, according to Sea-Intelligence CEO Alan Murphy. 
 
Trade data shows a decline in Asia imports to the U.S. by 11% year-over-year in October, which built on a September decline. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt find any grounds for optimism in November,‚Äù HLS told clients.,2022-12-13T19:57:42Z

$ZIM  problem here for ZIM is tax loss selling.  When your losses are so big and no one thinks there will be any good news for a while for shipping your screwed unless you have a buyback program. Sell now buy back lower and have a 50 percent capital loss to offset gains.  Again management hosing investors,2022-12-13T18:14:46Z

$ZIM Bears win again. 10 months in a row.  Bulls lie to themselves that the market magic is going to ignore the stupid dividend setup that hurts its shareholders and we will realize the value in the company with a .38 NAV.  Every time over 18.50 we sell off faster then ELi Glickman can pocket a few million off shareholders.,2022-12-13T17:58:44Z
