$ZIM the comments here are kind of nuts. Ive never seen any other wall where people are so convinced about the share price movement after a dividend payment üòÑ,2022-03-18T03:32:23Z

$ZIM So all you nervous nellies run for the hills you will just miss out on 17.00 per share.,2022-03-18T00:38:24Z
$ZIM AMKBY. Another shipping stock that just had a big dividend.. 1.92 per share. Closed at 17.30 before ex divi day. Stock price the next morning showed 15.38. So they took it off share price. But it opened at 16.61. 2 days later back over 17.00. I expect the same here.,2022-03-18T00:25:20Z
$ZIM I got 20 shares. It&#39;s tomorrow last day for dividend. I&#39;ll buy 2 more if it is.,2022-03-18T00:12:33Z
$ZIM I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m confused about all this talk of share price tanking after dividend paid. Granted a huge dividend but Not clear on mechanics of how/why share price will react a certain way. Don&#39;t shorts have to pay any regular dividends as condition of being short?. I do know whenever I own a stock where everyone predicting xyz will happen and affect the share price in such and such way, it almost never plays out that way.,2022-03-17T23:47:29Z

$ZIM so my first divy play here, yes I‚Äôm expanding my repertoire. So to all you divy players, will this actually drop 17 bucks on Tuesday?  Seems like a wash isn‚Äôt really a solid ST play. Thoughts?,2022-03-17T21:16:13Z
$ZIM people scared of what will happen after the dividend should look at what happened to Zim post paying out its dividend in December. It ripped higher as shorts had to cover. Lol,2022-03-17T21:15:30Z
$ZIM market makers are underwater on this one. Will do everything they can to not pay out. Oddly, we know Shorts are gonna cover if they can‚Äôt crack the stock on Tuesday, meaning we can get the dividend while shorts will pile out. Plus Zim will be short sale restricted on Wednesday next week causing even further potential for short calamity. the last div Zim rallied hard after it got paid out. Counterintuitive nonsense but bring it bears. Enjoy hitting the exits en mass on wednesday while paying 17 dollars to me!,2022-03-17T21:10:17Z
