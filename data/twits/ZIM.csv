$ZIM  
Who here is drip&#39;n back into the stock monday, also is anybody trading covered calls on this position. It kinda seems like a no brainer right now (which is seldom seen in the market). With covered calls, you still collect the dividend and you collect your premium, with the best balance sheet I have ever seen on a stock, is this not an easy trade. If anybody has any insight or alternative thoughts please let me know. P/E sub 2, with the acquistion of almost 20 vessells in the past 2 months, kinda seems like they are in a good contracted out position,2022-04-02T01:23:44Z

$ZIM i wonder if people are thinking this will drop a bunch on monday (dividend amount) because that is the date we all get paid our dividend? hope they aren&#39;t thinking that but WTF do i know...i figured people understood dividends and how they worked better than it seems they do,2022-04-01T19:06:07Z
$ZIM so the Ken stake was reduced by 6 million shares, seems to calculate as an average price of $77.1 per share, sometime in March. I am curious if it was in the run up prior to the div or after ex div when it briefly hit that range. And who was the buyer or was it just an on market transaction? Curious to know. Also curious to know the reasons for selling, since they still own 20% stake. Profit taking? Tax reasons? Reallocation of capital? Would be good to know. Doesn‚Äôt really change anything.,2022-04-01T18:47:45Z

$ZIM stopped for a loss when it broke $72. Areas that should be holding around the market aren&#39;t. Getting a bit cautious here, can always re-enter later.,2022-04-01T17:35:45Z
