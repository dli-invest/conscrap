$ZIM &quot;When is the dividend, how much is the dividend?&quot; - Clueless retail investors like these are the reason why this stock can be successfully shorted, despite a price/book ratio well under 0.5. Look at other shipping companies. They have P/B in the region 1.3 to 2. Yes 4 times higher. That will apply to ZIM too, once the panics stops. &quot;But when is the dividend?&quot; you ask... I give up.,2023-02-02T01:43:47Z
