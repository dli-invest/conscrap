$LPI I sold puts and will buy calls. Santa gave me a discount on this one. Such a great buy.  
 
Another one is $ZIM. More cash than market cap. Inventory will get replenished at some point and shipping rates will rebound. I do hope that we get a bit longer recession so that I can accumulate on the cheap and 5x invested.,2022-12-10T05:15:34Z

$ZIM Global shipping rates are what matter most to us and are very difficult to predict.  What I can predict with certainty, is that lower shipping rates are the cure to low rates because shipping companies will go out of business, lowering supply, and ultimately leading to greater profitability for those that survive.,2022-12-09T22:24:22Z

$ZIM Here&#39;s the response I received from ZIM regarding buyback:   
Thank you for your email and for being a ZIM shareholder. ZIM management is committed to creating enduring shareholder value and a critical component of this is returning capital to shareholders. We have indicated in the past that until today, we opted to promote return of capital to shareholders with dividends, in accordance with the dividend policy and have taken steps to improve our policy to reward long term shareholders since going public in early 2021. Management and the board have considered and will continue to evaluate what is the best avenue to returning capital to shareholders, and as stated, until today opted for dividends. We will continue to work closely with our Board to ensure all options are thoroughly explored for the benefit of shareholders, including a buyback program.

Close your eyes again for 5 years.
