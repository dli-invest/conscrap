$ZIM that chart today looks like the bat was watching!  Shorties better fear!,2022-11-29T21:24:17Z
$ZIM @marketdancer just one small point - INDEX shows SPOT container freight prices. ONE MOMENT - JUST 20% of all container and other shipping industry real world orders are SPOT orders. other 80% are long term orders with very different prices. very different from index - mean HIGHER - that mean today only 20% of revenue are based in medium (at all carriers and shippers total revenue) on SPOT - and other are LONG TERM contracts, lets take as example DANAOS shipping $DAC  - they more than half year ago already were signed contracts for long term for almost 3 (THREE ! years) on capacity more than 95% for 2022-2023 and until about 80%+ for capacity of 2025. 
that is real reason, why freightos index went down but $ZIM 3q revenue and almost ALL shipping companies revenue was record high, in time, when 3q freight rates were ALREADY down to 4000-3500. 
that is reality, but not the logistic middlemen  companies wishes. middlemen here are just small part of equation. and NOT STRONGEST part,2022-11-29T21:13:23Z
