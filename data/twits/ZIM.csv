$ZIM a lot of people here are saying there&#39;s going to be a sell-off after the div and that we&#39;ll be 70+ before div. And also saying that the price will settle around 57. I get the big sell off after the $17 div, that makes sense, but would there really be a big sell off over a 2.80div? Like it doesn&#39;t make sense that most people would abandon their positions for 2.85 minus tax to the point where it would drop $13. And if there&#39;s soo many people just chasing that pre div jump, is there really enough to make it crash that much? Feels like this stock will reach 80+ soon enough, seems crazy to give up on your positions when you likely won&#39;t be able to buy back in at your current cost. Am I missing something?,2022-05-23T21:34:59Z

$ZIM I question what is going on. I agree this should be at $120. The global economy has is making buyers very cautious. But, everyone is looking for something to believe in. No doubt ZIM has kind of cornered the shipping container market. Brand new LPG driven ships coming in 2023. Leases extended for a few years. A proven track history. Loaded with liquid cash. Massive dividend payouts. But then there is the ahhhh; well nothing I guess.,2022-05-23T18:32:28Z
