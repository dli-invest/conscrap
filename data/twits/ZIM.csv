$ZIM Can someone help me understand the dividend on this stock? Do you actually get 17 dollars per share? What is going on there?,2022-04-21T04:31:03Z
$ZIM If you see users here (@Immunoglobin) pumping penny stocks and tagging it with ZIM, make sure to report.  We&#39;re here to talk about ZIM, not other companies.,2022-04-21T01:07:10Z
$ZIM Finally, somebody is recognizing the technology advantages that ZIM has against its competitors!  Maybe now they&#39;ll trade more like a technology stock and get more than a 1.6X P/E (industry average is 4)

$ZIM still undervalue so add more shares,2022-04-20T21:40:50Z
$CTRM is currently trading at $2.30 per share with a market cap at $0.22B and 29 operating vessels.

$ZIM  currently trading at $60 per share with a market cap of $7.12B and 110 operating vessels.

If we stay with a direct apples to apples, without other external factors, CTRM market cap should be at $1.9B (at current market circumstances and assuming ZIM is traded at fair value.) Then CTRM SP is 11% of its current value and it would be normal to see a 9-10 times spike approx. $20 SP

Just the basic math. But I‚Äôm sure there are more factors involved.,2022-04-20T21:30:04Z

Providing an outlook for freight rates going forward, Deutsche Bank analyst Andy Chu stated, ‚ÄúWe expect 2022 to be a record year for the container shipping industry supported by higher contracted rates.‚Äù  
 
However, the analyst thinks ‚Äúweaker-than-expected demand for goods will help ease the supply chain issues and port congestion, and may help freight rates normalize faster than anticipated.‚Äù  
 
Chu downgraded Hapag Lloyd and A.P. Moeller Maersk stocks to Holds and lowered the freight rate forecast for 2023 and 2024.  
 
Chu expects freight rates to decline by 30% and 25% for 2023 and 2024, respectively. Earlier, he projected a 20% and 15% decline in freight rates for 2023 and 2024 for Hapag-Lloyd and Maersk.

Shanghai relaxes COVID-19 restrictions, 12 million freed from lockdown 
 
Throughout the Shanghai lockdown the port has stayed open, according to Mandarin Shipping founder Tim Huxley. But economic disruptions have been caused by the strict COVID-19 lockdown. 
 
Huxley told CNBC China&#39;s shipping industry could come back strong in the final days of April.,2022-04-20T19:09:52Z

$ZIM $GOGL  
 
The queue of container ships outside major Chinese ports like Shanghai has been getting longer by the day, and Huxley said many ships are not even calling in Shanghai now. 
 
Supply chain disruptions have dogged the global economy since the early stages of the pandemic as a result of lockdowns, changes in consumer behavior and, more recently, the Russia-Ukraine war, among other factors. 
 
It may take a while for things to completely return to normal, but Huxley says ‚Äúconsiderable‚Äù comfort can be taken in China‚Äôs ‚Äúincredibly quick‚Äù bounce back from its 2020 Covid lockdown.   
 
‚ÄúAs a result, we then had the strongest surge in container freight rates and container shipping demand in history,‚Äù he added. 
 
‚ÄúThis time ‚Äî we don‚Äôt know obviously ‚Äî but there is clearly going to be huge amounts of pent-up demand, both with factories returning to work and with getting these exports and manufactured goods out again,‚Äù Huxley said.,2022-04-20T18:55:55Z

ALL INDICATORS SHOW A SPIKE IS COMING.  
 
Shipping rates are falling from pandemic peak 
 
China lockdowns and a reduction in US spending on durable goods has pushed shipping rates down in the last month, although a spike is also on the way

However.... 
 
Container shipping could rebound by late April as Covid eases in China, shipping investment firm exec says 
 
PUBLISHED TUE, APR 19 202211:26 PM EDT 
 
The container shipping industry could see a ‚Äúvery strong‚Äù pickup starting late April as the Covid situation in China eases, Tim Huxley, founder of Mandarin Shipping, told CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúStreet Signs Asia‚Äù on Monday. 
Shanghai has been on lockdown since last month because of a rise in Covid-19 cases. 
The city, also home to the world‚Äôs busiest container port, subsequently suffered from a breakdown in the logistics supply chain.

Next few weeks still gonna be rough. Damn China.  
 
Exacerbated by ongoing supply chain disruptions, port congestion along the East and West Coasts is driving the price of shipping containers downward, a trend that is expected to last for the next few weeks, according to research from Germany-based technology firm Container XChange, which tracks container movement trends worldwide.
