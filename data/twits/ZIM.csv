$ZIM Remember my little dividend junkies - this is a 6-7 week play that will net you a 30-40% return. You‚Äôll need to exit post ex date. 

Diversifying afterwards into things like ET (.30) a share every quarter and is a steady rock solid investment or ARR a reit that pays (.10) a share a month AMBKY also pays out a yearly dividend which should come in March.,2023-02-02T22:43:45Z
$ZIM Does anyone know the date that you have to own shares to get the dividend?,2023-02-02T21:58:42Z

$ZIM Those who are long need to grasp that it is not in their interests to have the price rise just before the dividend payout. If you have $8 of dividend in hand at a share price of $16, you can increase your holding by 50% by dripping. But if the share price is $20, your holding can increase by only 40%. So let the fear factor dominate for a while longer.  
 
But why would you want to increase your holding? One solid reason is that each share gives ownership of a fraction of the cash reserve, that will be worth about $16 per share, maybe more, even after the dividend payout.,2023-02-02T20:20:39Z
$ZIM If some is going to leave money sitting there for you to take then you should take it,2023-02-02T20:17:45Z

$ZIM Well, if I had a crystal ball, I would have taken all my shares and sold them at $22.88 today and buy them back now at $21.69, and thus had 5% more shares.  
 
But maybe the stock market is teaching me to be patient, and grateful that we are up over $1, today.  
 
And to hold on in case this stock in the next month or so goes to $25, $30, or higher.,2023-02-02T19:33:41Z

$ZIM My average purchase price for ZIM is $41, as I have averaged down over time.  I would like to buy more at the current cheaper price, based on the great dividend payouts.
