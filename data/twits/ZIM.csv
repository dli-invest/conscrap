$ZIM Tomorrow (Monday) is the last day investors can purchase $ZIM stock and be entitled to the $17 dividend per share.  Tuesday, $ZIM goes ex-dividend.  Where do you think the stock will close at on each day?  It should be interesting to watch!  GLTA!,2022-03-21T03:37:50Z

There could also be a time in the near future where they decide to start buying back shares which will help the SP go UP

$ZIM Thanks to everybody for their feedback on my strategy of being in for the dividend and buying PUT options as a downside hedge. I agree that selling PUTS seems like the better way to go, however I am going to take a different track. So here is my strategy, I am in for the dividend, and I am going to buy PUT options 20% out of the money. If I am wrong, I will only lose the premium, if I am right I will clean up big time. I guess we will have to see what happens. If I get burned, it will have to be a lesson learned.,2022-03-20T16:15:57Z

‚ÄúThe prospects for greater U.S. soybean and corn exports due to a worse-than-expected South American harvest and the Russian-Ukraine war has shippers securing covered barge capacity for future needs,‚Äù J. Alan Barrett, director of research and consulting at Higby Barrett LLC in Memphis, said in an email. 
 
Further pushing up barge freight was the resurgence in coal markets amid demand to replace Russian natural gas and crude oil, presenting a rare demand boon for both agricultural and energy along U.S. rivers. 
 
‚ÄúMany years have passed since the two most important commodities for the Mississippi Inland River System have been simultaneously bullish,‚Äù Barrett said.

Another year of crazy hiccups‚Äô: Russia and China pose new threats to global supply chain

But supply chain specialists said they expect conditions to deteriorate, reversing the recent improvement in the container ship backlog off the California coast and complicating the Federal Reserve‚Äôs fight against inflation. 
 
‚ÄúWhat people expected to be a recovery year is going to be another year of crazy hiccups in supply chains,‚Äù said Johannes Schlingmeier, chief executive of xChange, a shipping container leasing company in Hamburg.,2022-03-20T16:09:04Z

$ZIM Who is ready for the $17 Dividend which will drop the stock price down $17?

Will u hold?,2022-03-20T13:22:55Z
$ZIM Getting ready for the monster dividend payout, too bad Israel charges a 25% tax on the dividend, that is kind of stinky. Here is an idea, why not be in for the dividend, and buy some PUT options as a downside hedge? It should be a win-win situation unless I am missing something.,2022-03-20T13:17:41Z
$ZIM - Hammer event detected suggesting April volume increase https://www.macroaxis.com/stocks/Pattern-Recognition/Hammer/ZIM,2022-03-20T13:11:32Z
$ZIM longer term holders should happily receive the dividend payout.  New investors should wait until Tuesday to buy.  Easy peasy.,2022-03-20T11:55:42Z
$ZIM when you sell on monday you want to save the tax which is 4.25$. the problem is that you may pay much more when you will try to buy it on tuesday.,2022-03-20T08:32:35Z
$ZIM lol all of a sudden sudden sentiment for Zim is green,2022-03-20T03:44:04Z
$ZIM I see everyone promoting this strategy of selling shares before ex-div date and then buying them back for less on or after ex-div date to &quot;avoid receiving the dividend&quot;.  Why wouldn&#39;t all investors hate dividends then?  If dividends are so bad, why do companies pay them?  Why don&#39;t all investors use this strategy to avoid all dividends? 
 
If I am not mistaken, $ZIM largest shareholders - $KEN and $DAC are in the same boat we are but with a lot more shares.  How pissed are they that $ZIM declared this large dividend?  Their dividends are subject to Israel dividend taxes too.  They don&#39;t get the foreign tax credit refund.  The dividends are also taxable income to these companies.  Their shares in ZIM will experience the same price fluctuations as ours post ex-div date?  Shouldn&#39;t they be absolutely pissed off at ZIM?!?!? 
 
Instead, $KEN and $DAC seem to be thrilled with $ZIM&#39;s dividends and enthusiastic about receiving them.  So, why do so many investors seem to be avoiding them?,2022-03-20T02:00:49Z
