$ZIM $DAC Strong Q4 earnings and maintaining dividend (0,75$) might be saying something about potential strong $ZIM Q4 earnings and (year end) dividend release. Outlook 2023 is in line with expectations/valuations so no surprises there too.,2023-02-15T07:27:15Z
$ZIM They wrote this too .. &quot;A lot of desperation and cultist posts on here. Look you bought in at 50,60,70,90 dollars and lost a packet even with those lumpy dividend payouts. I get that you are desperate to see a uptick but the fundamentals are not there. From 2012-2019 the company made an average loss of -5.7% on turnover with rates around $3300. They are now around $2700. A 30-50% payout will see a coming Div of $1- $2 and from Q2 onwards zero as there will be no profit and a price of $10-15 which is fair value. I wont read your replies&quot;,2023-02-15T07:12:27Z
