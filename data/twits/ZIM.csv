$ZIM Shipping companies enjoy the high rates and they don√¢¬Ä¬ôt want or plan to push for any reductions. I truly believe there is zero chance we will ever see rates like pre COVID. this is true with moving cargo on flights as well. The margins in trucking, ocean/air shippings are changed for ever. Thus, we might see much higher or slightly lower imo. Some hope this is not the case but history teach us otherwise. Long hold ZIM!,2022-04-04T01:30:07Z
$ZIM High short sale volume and dividends getting reinvested this week‚Ä¶ 
Any predictions?,2022-04-04T00:14:21Z
Short sale volume (not short interest) for $ZIM at 2022-04-01 is 44%. http://shortvolumes.com/?t=ZIM via @shortvolumes,2022-04-03T22:41:35Z
$ZIM Zim has much less cyclical risk than analysts seem to believe.  This is an excerpt from $KEN (Zim&#39;s largest shareholders) press release on Friday: 
 
&quot;ZIM carried approximately 3.5 million TEUs in 2021 representing a 23% increase as compared to 2020, in which ZIM carried approximately 2.8 million TEUs. The average freight rate in 2021 was $2,786 per TEU, as compared to $1,229 per TEU in 2020.&quot; 
 
So, yes, rates have doubled and may normalize several years into the future as supply chains recover and new ships are delivered.  However, we&#39;re looking at a company that took 23% additional market share (keeping the rate increases out of the equation) and that is impressive.  Absolutely worth more than a 1.8 P/E.,2022-04-03T21:52:53Z

Moral of the story: BE AGILE.  
 
According to the latest monthly report from freight rate benchmarking firm Xeneta, long-term rates increased by an average 7% in March. propelling the year-on-year contract rate gain to almost 100%. 
 
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYet again, another bumper month for the carrier community, with climbs across all major trade corridors,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù said Xeneta CEO Patrik Berglund.

Meanwhile, Drewry, while suggesting that some of the downside risks were now stacking up for the container lines, said it did not think it would be the end of the bull run for container freight rates √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú but it added a caveat: √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe market is extremely volatile and things can change very fast.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù,2022-04-03T17:23:33Z

$DAC Spot rates have been declining recently, but contract rates have offset the decline. Here¬ís a quote from GCaptain:

&quot;Despite some easing spot container freight rates major bottlenecks remain and Covid situation in China, as well as a possible US west coast labour dispute, are expected to keep rates relatively high through 2023.&quot;

The slight easing of eastbound trans-Pacific container spot rates and US truckload spot rates, coupled with weakening economic indicators, is dangling signs of so-called normalization for ocean and surface transport prices. That those record highs may be over will be cold comfort for shippers, however. 
 
Container lines are hedging any comments on the easing of container rates and US port congestion with warnings that the volume pressure isn‚Äôt letting up and port performance gains may slip again. Zim Integrated Shipping told investors it expected some spot rate normalization in the second half of this year. Yet the carrier‚Äôs leadership told JOC.com nothing was guaranteed. 
 
‚ÄúIt is possible there will be actually no [container spot rate] normalization before 2023,‚Äù Xavier Destriau, Zim‚Äôs executiveVP and cfo, said Mar 9. ‚ÄúThere is no significant capacity coming in 2022 and incremental capacity will only start coming in 2023.‚Äù

Rates are unlikely to return where they were before the pandemic, when carriers suffered from overcapacity and low profits for years, said Stephanie Loomis, vice president of international procurement at freight forwarder CargoTrans, Inc.   
 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs settling into the market now that the days of really very low, ridiculously cheap ocean rates are over,‚Äù she said, adding that prices are unlikely to stay at these levels for more than a couple of years and will likely settle a little lower.
