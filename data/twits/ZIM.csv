$ZIM The price will drop $17 per share on Monday to reflect the dividend. But it will quickly recover that drop in price IMO. PT set at $140,2022-03-19T04:29:30Z

$ZIM what are some other good divi plays this year?,2022-03-19T02:49:38Z
$ZIM looking forward to collecting a 17 $ dividend. And also looking forward to the company up loading the next 3 quarters divis to maybe 3. Or 3.50 per quarter. And also looking forward to a plus 20$ next April. I like ZACKS price target of 120$. I think that is about 50$ low but what ever.,2022-03-19T02:17:40Z

$ZIM closes below the 4EMA on daily with selling into close during last hour of day.  Probably going to get the same action we got in December before ex-dividend.  Sucks that markets up big 2 days in a row, and we were down.  Will price hold 80 on Monday?,2022-03-18T20:12:20Z

$ZIM only gap not filled is just under 80?,2022-03-18T17:15:27Z
$ZIM This is the type of misinformation new investors are following.,2022-03-18T17:01:47Z
$ZIM dont worry guys. 84- 17 is 67. u get dividend use it to buy the stock at 67 on Ex Date. it will go back to 84 this way. invest back to the company to reap the max benefit.,2022-03-18T16:55:14Z
$ZIM going broke what a joke..  pumping your short. The company is debt free. Earned 39$ per share last year. Could earn 50$ a share this year. Trades at 2x earnings. I think there is a decent chance it closes GREEN by the end of the day.,2022-03-18T16:39:47Z
$ZIM no brainer,2022-03-18T16:33:29Z
$zim reminds me of $tops back in the day boat shippers got pummeled for years. I say zim pays the dividend and then goes broke bc they gave away all the money, u don‚Äôt build market cap by giving away the loot, duh.   Reinvest it etc it grows, have a good year and then give it away sounds like a bad strategy to grow market cap this headed much much lower. The dividend payment will fuel the sell off,2022-03-18T16:07:22Z
$ZIM sold my calls yesterday at that big spike and buying shares to get that dividend.  Ready for big returns.  Good luck to all.,2022-03-18T15:12:04Z
