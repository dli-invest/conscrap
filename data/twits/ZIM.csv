$OCCI $ORC $IEP $ZIM $USOI  anyone here that trades on Webull noticed that their charts are reduced by the dividend amounts? So each time a dividend is paid the chart history keeps going lower and lower. Seems like an unnecessary duplicate since they always trade ex-dividend anyway. Just curious if anyone else noticed and / or asked them about it. Thanks!,2023-02-04T03:52:25Z
$ZIM has a good Piotroski-F score of 7.00.

$ZIM  going to be vulnerable here and ask a dividend question

Wife is pregnant, don‚Äôt make enough to cover one of us working. Have about $40k to figure out what to do with. Can anyone state this pays its dividends and worth the investment? 

Doing my own DD but nothing beats real exposure to the truth like experience.,2023-02-03T23:57:20Z

$ZIM this dividend is crazy. Should I assume I&#39;m wrong because it&#39;s showing me 136.59% Divi. That can&#39;t be sustainable. Regardless I think I might stick around and park some money here this year.,2023-02-03T20:35:46Z
$ZIM I could be full of sh*t but today&#39;s move seems like it could be some shorts taking advantage of a blood red day and returning shares.

Eirher way, $25 next week,2023-02-03T20:18:56Z

$ZIM undervalued, has been too cheap for too long. They still don&#39;t have the same Price to Earnings multiple as their peers despite continued success. I&#39;m staying onboard the dividend ship with ZIMMMM,2023-02-03T18:08:52Z
