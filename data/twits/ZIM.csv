If the Left Coast bottles up, rates would climb again: 
 
Long-stalled West Coast port labor talks are showing no signs of progress, according to people familiar with the negotiations, extending uncertainty for U.S. retailers who rely on the coast to import goods from Asia. 
 
Shipping industry and Biden administration officials had hoped the talks, which began in May, would conclude last fall. But, people familiar with the negotiations say the parties haven‚Äôt made progress since the summer on regional issues that are delaying discussion of major contract provisions, including wages and automation.  
 
One person familiar with the talks said there was a growing sense of frustration in the maritime industry. ‚ÄùEveryone would like to see this conclude so there‚Äôs no more uncertainty in the market and we can move on,‚Äù the person said.
