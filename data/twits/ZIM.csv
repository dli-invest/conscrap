The prevailing viewpoint on freight rates is that ALL EYES ARE ON SHANGHAI: 
 
******************************************* 
 
Global supply chain disruption is set to last at least another 12 months, and could run through all of 2023, according to Toll Group Managing Director Thomas Knudsen. 
Marcus Hand | Apr 12, 2022 
 
‚ÄúMy view is that prices will come back up. As soon as a Shanghai opens up and suddenly you get these massive bottlenecks opening up in other places,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think prices are going to be elevated. They&#39;re [customers] are going to keep on relying on a supply chain that&#39;s broken, so disruptions, lack of predictability, I think everything they&#39;ve struggled with the last one - two years is going to be the same.‚Äù

....the optimism is such that it is only at the last minute that the market must face the hard reality as 
the inevitable ‚Äúpricing of the contract‚Äù takes place. In the meantime, a lot of work has been done in the background 
to clear prompt open vessels and, with the improved seasonality as a tailwind for spot rates, the expectation is for 
a rally in the coming weeks.

The weekly Drewry assessment for Shanghai to Los Angeles came in at $8,824 per standard container on Thursday, down 20 percent from early March.  
 
&quot;At the moment [Asia-West Coast] demand is fairly low, almost unseasonably so,&quot; George Griffiths, managing editor of global container freight at S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, told International Shipping News on Monday. 
 
Freight rates are still high on a yearly basis. 
For example, freight rates on Shanghai - Los Angeles dropped 3 percent or $288 to $8,824 from March 31 to April 7, while its annual change shows the very opposite - an increase of 110 percent year-on-year, according to Drewry&#39;s composite World Container Index.

This FREIGHT RATE dip is widely seen to be TEMPORARY. Really surprised there is not more buying on the come.  
 
********************************* 
 
Feature: Asian lockdowns prompt further uncertainty in container market 
 
...Market uneasy as Chinese lockdowns persist 
...Freight rates soften, but dip expected to be temporary 
...Market sentiment holds bearish, and rates are expected to regain lost ground as China comes out of lockdown and backlogged volumes begin to mount. 
 
As of April 12, Platts cFlow trade analytics software showed 315 vessels waiting in the Shanghai/Ningbo region queue and 141 in the Hong Kong region. 
 
&quot;Shutdowns in China could assist to give ports in Europe and Asia some breathing room. ... &quot; an ocean carrier source said. &quot;Shipping lines could shuffle some capacity into other trades like North Atlantic, Indian Subcontinent or Middle East.&quot;
