$ZIM  
Math can be hard for some, so here are the basics of what to expect according to the company‚Äôs own so-called dividend policy (search for ZIM dividend policy as a source).  
 
1 - Dividends already paid in 2022 = $2.85 + $4.75 + $2.95 = $10.55, or ~30% of net income for Q1, Q2, &amp; Q3. Easy enough so far.  
 
2 - Upcoming dividend:  
# 2a - Q4 part of net income @ ~30% based on $3.05 EPS guidance is: $0.92.  
 
So full year at 30% (likely will amount to $11.47)  
Note: this would div yield of 17.8% as of closing Jun 01, 2022, not quite the 125%+ people are going crazy over (also then deduct 25% withholding tax, lol).  
 
# 2b - Optional full year top up (according to ZIM policy of &quot;30-50% of the annual net income&quot;) of an additional 0-20% will range from:  
[] $0.00 (as explained above) to ~20% of net income from Q1-Q3 + likely inaccurate generous consensus estimate of ~370million or ~$7.52 
 
[] For a range of $0.92-$8.44 (based on high consensus).,2023-02-20T20:24:14Z

$ZIM ZIM isn&#39;t my biggest shipping stock anymore, but it has been beat down more than it should regardless. Way more bullish on DAC and GSL, but ZIM still has a big upside to it in the longer term. But gleaning its intrinsic value is very difficult compared to lessor companies due to its current asset-light model and unsecured future revenue. Also what people seem to ignore is that it is using its huge cash position to earn interest. TTM non-operating interest income is $92 million, which is close to annual operating incomes in the past on its own...,2023-02-20T16:18:34Z
$ZIM Both the $30 price target and $15 price target set by analysts make sense if you look at it from their perspective. 
ZIM probably will start to bleed money from next year due to their asset-light charter model, their income is dependent on charter rates+container shipping rates (fbx, drewry etc etc)... Depending on how much ZIM bleeds cash in the future, both $30 and $15 could be reasonable. But I&#39;d think that $30 is more likely right now. $15 PT assumes that ZIM will keep chartering the same amount of ships at the same routes while rates keep falling to pre-covid levels. I think this assumption is extreme, and I believe that ZIM management will stop chartering so many ships and shrink their fleet. Lots of renewals coming up, with a gradual shift to LNG ships to decrease cost. ZIM is also prey to retail valuations according to only their dividend policy and not their retained earnings+ future earnings, which is increasing its volatility.,2023-02-20T16:12:48Z

A.P. Moller-Maersk (AMKBY) announced on February 15, 2023 that shareholders of record as of March 29, 2023 would receive a dividend of $2.20 per share on April 17, 2023. 

Last year AMKBY currently paid investors $1.30 per share, or 11.58%, on an annual basis.

$ZIM To be consistent and according to past statements of wanting to pay regular quarterly dividends, the next payment date should be around 3/8. I&#39;m guessing that since there hasn&#39;t even been an earnings announcement date, this is going to slip. So much for trying to establish a quarterly policy.,2023-02-19T16:59:10Z

$ZIM I wouldn‚Äôt touch this stock with a 10ft stick. Once the meme crowd jumps on board, all logic goes out the window.  
 
I have no thoughts on the direction of this stock. Or of the company in a general sense. But that is reason enough to stay the-f away. I might as well go play crypto-roulette. 
 
Also equities that attract memidiots tend also to lose money rather quickly with all the new attention. Not sure how exactly, but no one knows how to mess a good thing up quite like the ‚Äújump aboard this rocket‚Äù crowd.  
 
A shame for the real investors involved.,2023-02-19T08:08:10Z

The truth is that &quot;Stock price predictions&quot; are a joke and they are ALWAYS wrong. They are always wrong because those who do the &quot;predicting&quot; intentionally &quot;under predict&quot; so... 
they....always look like a &quot;hero&quot;. :) 
The greater truth is...ZIM is owned by &quot;Israeli&quot;.. 
that is Jewish...businessmen, who will ALWAYS &quot;Look out for number one&quot;. They will always find a way to pump this back to $ 90.00 to  
$ 100.00 a share. 
THAT is where each of them will &quot;Make the money&quot;. And, so will we. :) 
Ignore EVERYTHING anyone says about this company and alleged &quot;news reports&quot;. :) 
ZIM is a winner. :) 
Best to everyone. :),2023-02-18T17:09:35Z
