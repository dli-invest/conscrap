Insiders own 1/3 of the company. They really canâ€™t sell so the share price isnâ€™t overly significant to them when you canâ€™t sell. 
But dividends absolutely count and why thereâ€™s no doubt thatâ€™s the focus vs share buybacks and other trickery.,2022-11-10T03:30:54Z

$ZIM So, I am a little confused. I think the ex-dividend date is 11/25. What will be the ex-dividend date after that? Roughly 3 months later, or what? And is probable that the one in early 2023 will be larger than the one in November/December 2022?,2022-11-09T21:57:27Z

$ZIM so now a 7.5% spread between $ZIM and $GSL on the day. Makes zero sense.
