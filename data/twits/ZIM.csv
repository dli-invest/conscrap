$ZIM  to the moon,2022-03-15T03:52:54Z
$ZIM I follow Gogl and Zim And I find the price movements between the two interesting. GOGl already did it‚Äôs dividend and Zim is next and it is interesting watching the price action.In GOGL it went to an all time high just before the div which is not  strange but the day before ex div it dropped hard. I was curious why such selling pressure before a div, why wouldn‚Äôt you want the div? I have come to realize the div locks you into the stock until the price recovers but if you pump up the price before the div and jump at the last minute you are free to leave with your capital gain. Then either rebuy after the div  or, more likely, come over here to Zim and repeat the same thing. Zim was in a steady uptrend, lost its way for a little bit like the rest of the market, and now is accelerating as it reaches the div date. After the Gogl div date. And Gogl hasn‚Äôt recovered because I figure those guys are now here. With such a large div I wonder if we will see what happened to Gogl play out here,2022-03-15T03:38:40Z

$ZIM I‚Äôm not too familiar with dividend investing - for those that are, I‚Äôve heard that often stock price falls the amount of the dividend after the ex-div date. In the case of a massive div like here, can a $17 drop actually be expected?,2022-03-15T00:51:31Z

$ZIM  Below is the unusual SweepCast activity, which I previously discussed on my previous post. #optionstrading #stockmarket,2022-03-15T00:17:56Z
$ZIM Decent Bullish Chart!!  The stock has broken the trend line resistance level with a huge volume and reached New ATH. Looking at the daily chart, the stock is continuously above the 20D,50D &amp; 200D SMA levels. #optionstrading #stockmarket,2022-03-15T00:16:27Z
$ZIM continues to be the strongest stock in the market. Great fundamentals, institutional ownership, strong stock in a strong group. Market pressure hasn&#39;t been able to bring it down yet. #IBDPartner @InvestorsBusinessDaily,2022-03-14T22:50:18Z

$ZIM new here to dividend investing... I can sell on the ex dividend date and still get the dividend correct?,2022-03-14T20:58:53Z
$ZIM this is a powerhouse of a name. I think $100 soon seems likely,2022-03-14T20:47:34Z
$ZIM I think it will go down after they pay the dividend,2022-03-14T20:44:24Z
$ZIM can someone the explain the effect of the share price and options with the huge dividend? Are  people just assuming it will tank when dividend collectors sell?,2022-03-14T20:30:45Z
$ZIM dividend euphoria is going to cost you‚Ä¶
Just like the last dividend rug pull. 
Target $72

$ZIM I just continue buying shares of zim periodically. My thoughts are that post divy, it will shoot back up in price right after the 17 dollars is taken out. An average 1 year pt of 90+ dollars, incredible growth, and the new baltimore integrative shipping feature, screams higher stock action. The avg volume has almost doubled in the past 3 months, as more people start to notice this beast,2022-03-14T20:21:16Z

$ZIM one of the only stock in green today,2022-03-14T20:11:31Z
$ZIM at current dividend of 15%, the investment would double in about 4.8 years; that doesn&#39;t even  consider reinvesting the dividends.,  which would make it in even less time.  What would be a bearish argument at current price levels here..?,2022-03-14T20:09:07Z
$ZIM very strong,2022-03-14T20:05:15Z
$ZIM love the momentum and fat dividend on this.  Anyone else in $GRIN too?  Similar business, fat dividend, and only a $400M market cap...,2022-03-14T19:54:36Z
$ZIM if it dip $17 buy and average down, it will go up immediately anyway,2022-03-14T19:40:49Z
$ZIM so this is going to dip $17 on ex-Div date. Is that a good price range to get in?,2022-03-14T19:20:10Z
