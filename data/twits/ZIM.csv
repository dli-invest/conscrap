&quot;Space is open in most of Asia as a result of the volume drop from central and north China, especially ex Shanghai,&quot; a carrier source said, adding that May volumes and freight rates are likely to be rangebound against those seen throughout April. &quot;There is no clear news in as far as when Shanghai can be completely reopened.&quot;,2022-04-30T17:36:04Z

$ZIM Look at it this way, in a week that destroyed the broad markets, ZIN actually closed up (on the weekly)

THAT is a strong showing!

$ZIM have a great weekend, some natural pull-back given market conditions and the run from 48 to 58, long and strong, fully invested here with ZIM (as you can see from my posts) and I also mentioned a week ago to not only buy ZIM, to buy RECONAFRICA (RECAF/ RECO.VN) IT WAS ALL GREEN this WEEK.

$ZIM The ironic thing is that these companies reporting reduced profits (AMZN, AAPL, etc.) are bringing down the market. Take a wild guess why their profit is reduced and where it&#39;s going.,2022-04-29T19:39:34Z
$ZIM snagged 100 more shares today. This is a no brainer. Earnings will be great, rates should remain high, and the dividends will be magical.  
 
This might turn into a great short after Q4 dividend date is past, but until then bullish as hell.,2022-04-29T19:30:56Z

Critical comment from other posts....I added the caps.... 
 
Subsequently, we think average annual freight rates are likely to decrease by around 44 percent in 2023. As this follows two years of very high increases, the dollar values will still be MUCH HIGHER higher than they were pre-pandemic.,2022-04-29T19:12:10Z

When will the freight rate go back to normal in 2023?  
 
SH: Unfortunately, that is impossible to answer as it is linked to the timing of the liner supply chain recovery that is highly unpredictable. The quicker it happens, the sooner rates will recede.  
 
Our working position is that port congestion will be fixed around the midpoint of next year. Subsequently, we think average annual freight rates are likely to decrease by around 44 percent in 2023. As this follows two years of very high increases, the dollar values will still be much higher than they were pre-pandemic.

Ocean carriers can expect container system inefficiencies to continue through the first half of 2023 as more medium-sized and even lower-volume ports become congested, according to Simon Heaney, senior manager at maritime consultancy Drewry. 
 
Heaney, during a Drewry webinar Tuesday, cited the worrisome trickle-down effects of widespread port congestion, echoing points made by the consultancy in its first-quarter report published at the end of March. 
 
Throughout last year, ports saw unrelenting heavy congestion, and the lack of improvement could mean at least another 12 months of lengthy delays and high freight rates, Drewry‚Äôs first-quarter report said. It identified the Russia-Ukraine war and mainland China‚Äôs zero-COVID strategy as double threats to the global economy that could worsen existing supply chain bottlenecks. Other potential hindrances include regulatory scrutiny, rising bunker fuel costs, decarbonization, and inflation.
