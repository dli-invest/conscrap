Compared to an average Enterprise Value to EBITDA ratio of 2.91, $ZIM is valued rather cheaply. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/ZIM/fundamental-analysis?key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2023-01-20T22:14:00Z
$ZIM I think it&#39;s about to get entertaining here. I&#39;m just going to sit here, holding my shares and collecting cash while I watch the house of cards fall as everyone realizes this company has a boatload of cash and is still making money despite the headwinds. What will they do with all that money? Give it to the shareholders of course.,2023-01-20T21:57:02Z
$ZIM month over month inflation in Canada just went negative. Lots of talk about lowering rates. Lots of talk about over doing it with interest rates.  
 
If I was a short seller I would be covering everything right now.  
 
These people are insane. Go short tesla or something instead jeez.  
 
If the FED pivots it won&#39;t be a gradual comeback. It&#39;s going to be a face ripper as everyone who is sitting on cash will be qued to go back in again at the same time short sellers get pants&#39;d  and can&#39;t get out.  
 
There is a lot of cash sitting in peoples accounts right now. Everyone is waiting for the right time, whatever that means.,2023-01-20T21:43:03Z

$ZIM Long term DRIP investors should not fret. The dividend does not depend on the share price. But the lower the share price dips, the more shares you can buy back. Unfortunately, *if* an $8 dividend is announced the share price will most likely rise by a similar amount, before the inevitable dip on ex-div day. If it does not, or if the ex-div dip is excessive, the benefits will be massive, allowing drippers to increase their holding by ~50%. Seems too good to be true, and probably is, but prices may dip low enough, courtesy of shorts, for a decent haul of new shares.,2023-01-20T18:29:07Z
$ZIM I am new here. Is the PE of less than .5 accurate?,2023-01-20T18:28:26Z
