$ZIM GME (Gamestop losing $4 per share) up 10% today to $90 ---that&#39;s how manipulated some stocks are! Imagine if ZIM had that sort of comp valuation and manipulation following! Sometimes the markets or stock price make no sense whatsoever. After all Tesla got to over $1,200 before it&#39;s great fall. ZIM is better than both these stocks.,2022-05-13T03:43:34Z

Interesting - makes me think those invested here should be more heavily weighted in container lessors with fixed contracts rather than betting on spot rates. ZIM is a bit riskier, though still probably has some upside from here,2022-05-12T21:15:58Z

Friend dnik8050. 
ZIM at $200 a share would have a and with the benefits of the year 2021 it would have a PER of 5.16, a luxury that many companies would already like to have.,2022-05-12T20:29:25Z

For RaymondR3ddington  06:32 PM $ZIM 
 You guys still think this is worth $100+ huh? 
 
 
Friend,  ZIM PER = 1.7 and a luxury balance without debt and with 3,800 M$ in cash and 1,225 in accounts receivable. 
 
Other companies that have dropped 50-70% and still are in PER 30-40. 
 
Don&#39;t you think they are enough arguments to be worth 100? 
At $100 the PER would be 3.5,2022-05-12T19:59:30Z

$ZIM So it is very clear how much confidence it can give when it comes to investing in it because of its robustness. However, any investment has its risks. Last week, it outperformed 95% of companies with a +10% rise in the midst of a slump (which I think is extraordinary). 
In conclusion, we await its financial results in May and if they are positive, the continuation of high prices and some volume would all point to Bullish. Let&#39;s hope for the best case scenario.  
 
What did you think of the review?

All indications are that the company will continue to perform well.  
I will explain: We are in a period very similar to stagflation, i.e. crisis + inflation. That is why the best stocks tend to be commodities (raw materials and transport), of course technology has fallen quite a lot because they are intangible assets and these give only long term benefits. So, with the rise in freight rates, shipping lines continue to increase their revenues, due to 1. the collapse of the ports and the high demand for shipping containers and 2. the Ukrainian war that &#39;favours&#39; the rise in the price of raw materials (inflation). In addition, it should be noted that the port of Shanghai is gradually improving and there will be work to smooth out the bottlenecks. ZIM is a company that is more than half a century old, with fairly healthy accounts and a good ratio to meet its debt repayments.,2022-05-12T19:01:44Z

$ZIM continue to be a great opportunity. Probably will show amazing earning next week, and macro scenario is still great.,2022-05-12T16:30:54Z
$ZIM With the gradual resumption of economic activities, the world trade picked up the pace, which in turn, is likely to aid the first-quarter results of shipping stocks like ZIM Integrated Shipping. This is because the shipping industry is responsible for transporting an enormous proportion of goods involved in world trade.

Revenues in the to-be-reported quarter are expected to have increased from fourth-quarter 2021 actuals, driven by improved revenues from containerized cargo, reflecting higher freight rates among other factors.

The positive sentiment surrounding the containership market is a huge positive for ZIM Integrated Shipping and might have aided its top line in the soon-to-be-reported quarter,2022-05-12T16:29:15Z
