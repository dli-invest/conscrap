@Hoekie12 @Billy777 @spiritchild @Luckiberti since it’s 25% there are special rules. check out $ZIM ’s last dividend. same rule applies.,2023-04-16T21:15:11Z

@SoxFan666 @Billy777 I added $ZIM after the dividend adjustment. Also collected the $6.80 (less 25%)
I’ll hold this one, collect the dividend then play it by ear. 
Same goes for $EC and $PBR.A,2023-04-16T19:37:01Z
My alerts for LARGE caps. I have timestamps + buy fills for everything What&#39;s my win rate?

I ONLY buy when Algos are tired of selling. How? I buy when &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; is low.
I don&#39;t make 100s of trades. I only buy when I get a confirmation. Ask me for the receipts. 

Next, I&#39;ll trade $ATVI + $CRWD + $SNOW + $ZIM + $NVAX,2023-04-16T19:26:48Z

$ZIM alpha finally had an honest article this weekend called stress test on zim. It really dug into the numbers. It went as far as worse case scenario. I&#39;ll link it but u thought I&#39;d do my own math with those numbers since the how much divy question keeps popping up. Going with the numbers at a 25 strike price. Zim investors are looking at a return of 14% on their money.  With total of 3.50 in divys for the year. And risk level extremely low.  Ofc this is the conservative rock bottom. Meaning the worst. And its when it&#39;s the worst is the time to buy and add as much as you can. This  est I did also puts next divy at 0. So with today&#39;s markets being batshit crazy. Investors have the comfort of earning at least 14% with potential to 50%. Not a bad investment.,2023-04-16T18:57:23Z
