$ZIM Bullish reversal completed at 11:00 AM today, 3 outside  up pattern on hourly chart.,2022-03-30T21:25:51Z
$ZIM Saw this on some other boards.  Not sure where it originated or how reliable it is.  But, I thought I would share here. 
 
Here is what the whisper numbers are saying: 
 
REV: $4.8 Billion ($1.7B same quarter, last year year) 
EBITDA: $3 Billion ($0.5B same quarter, last year year) 
Net Income: $2.58 Billion ($0.5 Billion) 
 
The rumour is that they will be declaring a $4.00 dividend to keep up with the 20% of Net Income in every quarter and 50% of their net income by the end of the year. 
If these numbers are even near to being remotely close, This stock is going soar. They&#39;d be beating their own guidance by 40% - 50% and the analyst expectations by at least 80%!,2022-03-30T20:56:29Z

According to Bloomberg, the German ports of Hamburg and Bremerhaven saw new highs in ship congestion this month, while Rotterdam, the continent‚Äôs busiest gateway for container traffic, saw its vessel backup at the start of the month reach an 11-month high. 
 
The snarls make any return to normal unlikely this year unless demand unexpectedly craters. Ocean shipping, the workhorse for some 80% of global trade, was stretched so thin that the spot rate to send a 40-foot container of goods to the U.S. from Asia averaged more than $10,000 in the second half of last year ‚Äî about seven times higher than the pre-pandemic level. Those rates have come down in recent weeks, but experts say the reprieve probably reflects a seasonal lull before transport demand and costs pick up again. 
 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to get worse as we move through the second half of this year and into peak season,‚Äù Mark Manduca, the chief investment officer of GXO Logistics, told Bloomberg.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Danish shipper Maersk said the Shanghai lockdown will severely hurt trucking services and increase transport costs, as China&#39;s intensifying efforts to fight the spread of COVID-19 further rattles global supply chains. 
 
&quot;Trucking service in and out (of) Shanghai will be severely impacted by 30% due to a full lockdown on Shanghai&#39;s Pudong and Puxi areas in turn until 5th April,&quot; Maersk, the world&#39;s second-largest container shipping company, said in an advisory to clients on Monday. 
 
It adding that warehouses in Shanghai would be closed until Friday. 
 
&quot;Consequently, there will be longer delivery time and a possible rise in transport costs such as detour fee and highway fee.&quot; 
 
SEKO Logistics, a U.S.-based freight transport and warehousing company, said &quot;We are anticipating: a sharp increase in air freight rates from today. We have already received some sky-high offers for enquires to Europe so far today,&quot; it said on its website.
