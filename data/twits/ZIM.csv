$ZIM all I know is Iâ€™m in a 16-24 trade now and am selling atm calls on a fundamental monster trading at its lows. Bears thesis is revs will fall but they havenâ€™t yet.

CTB spiked also which is a deterrent on shorting it long term I guess,2023-03-31T01:11:30Z
$ZIM,2023-03-31T00:29:27Z
@Sheeny2 This is a &gt; 25% dividend so will trade under the DUE BILL rules. The current date are no good and will be revised by the Exchange to comply with those rules. Google Due Bill. Also a visit to the $ZIM ( &gt; 25% dividend) stream will cover the rules in many post not in legalese. Plan accordingly.,2023-03-31T00:24:25Z

$ZIM I will support this company as long as they give me that juicy Divy.,2023-03-31T00:00:10Z
$ZIM everyone talking about the obvious scenario that stock will drop after all the freeloaders looking for the div bail out. I went back at looked at stock price post previous dividends and I donâ€™t see huge drops. Is that a function of the price being  skewed after it trades at its new price? Or am I not looking at charts correctly?  Anyone have any information or has anyone dug into this?,2023-03-30T23:01:21Z

$ZIM $VHC i am not paid,  nor do I pump anything ever until today. I have 1,000 shares of ZIM. Today I bought 7,000 shares of $VHC. A $1.00 dividend on a $1.45 stock. Payable on 4/17â€¦â€¦. I think itâ€™s a great deal,2023-03-30T22:18:29Z
$ZIM gonna be a mad rush to get shares tomorrow with it being a Friday....can&#39;t wait!!!,2023-03-30T22:18:18Z
$ZIM  
Because all shares now have the dividend attached to them (happened on the record date) and trade along with the dividend, if one purchases shares from now to any time up to close on pay date April 3 and hold them until the open on April4, they of course receive the dividend.   
  
Since the record date, one may sell or buy shares and the dividend transfers along with the share via the &quot;due bill&quot; process. The last man (or woman) standing who owns the share at close on April 3 before the ex div on the 4th, receives the dividend.  
  
quite simple actually,2023-03-30T22:05:26Z
$ZIM good chance to go bonkers over the next few days as people realizing they get a huge dividend plus a very solid company that is shareholder friendly and will generate profit for a long time.,2023-03-30T21:45:58Z
$ZIM as a U.S. citizen what is the best tactic for non retirement acct? Sell shares end of day April 3 3:59pm? Rebuy next morning $6.40 cheaper at 7am?,2023-03-30T21:27:57Z
$ZIM Just in case someone asks tonight.,2023-03-30T21:12:50Z
$ZIM Last day to buy for dividend, Today, Friday, or Monday?,2023-03-30T20:47:56Z
$ZIM seems volume is done for the day. We will have to wait for tomorrow for 24.50,2023-03-30T19:49:43Z
$ZIM Just to clarify, if I purchase shares prior to 4/3, I will be eligible for a $6.40/share dividend payment? Seems off from what I know, but seeing people talk about &gt;25% yield provides exceptions. If someone could clarify, that would be helpful. Thanks!,2023-03-30T19:29:40Z
$ZIM so if I put 5k in this will I get 5k at the end?,2023-03-30T19:04:26Z
