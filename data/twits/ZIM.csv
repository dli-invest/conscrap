$ZIM Game on ! Will wait for breakout. Nothing else seems good in market right now, other than this.,2022-04-18T18:29:28Z
$ZIM So, conservatively they earned between 10-12 $ in Q1 and will at least do 8-10$ in Q2, so we are already at an accumulated dividend of 6-10$ in 2022 for the first half. So this is already trading below 50$. So even if worst-case would hit, and we would be at ~12-14 $ eps in the 2nd half of 2022, we are talking 10-17 $ of dividend. If China reopening and the annual peak beginning at the end of Q2 only leads to a stabilized 7-9k$ drewry index and not the spike many experts expect then we would be at ~10-11 $/quarter, so 12-22$ of dividends. And that from a debt-free company with the highest profitability in the sector…,2022-04-18T18:27:23Z
$ZIM was a good trade into earnings. They paid out a $17 dividend and the stock has dropped since.,2022-04-18T18:25:28Z
