$ZIM 40s next,2022-06-10T02:41:32Z

$ZIM Entered today. It seems that not everyone knows that 50% of ZIM contracts for the next 6 to 12 months are already signed /agreed with the highest rates. Strong results at least up to Q1-2023,2022-06-10T01:31:35Z
$ZIM guys this can easily go under $40 and possibly even $20-$30s range. I like this company but every time it crashes it finds a lower low and a lower hight.

It went to mid 80‚Äôs then crashed after div to 50‚Äôs followed by $48‚Ä¶

Went to low $70‚Äôs and now it‚Äôs already down in the 50‚Äôs with a heavy sell trend/pressure and no resistance until the mid $40s then down to hell.,2022-06-10T01:27:13Z

$ZIM This shit is 75% owned by institutions and insiders. And yet people are Heavily stacking shorts against it every single day. 3.5 mil yesterday, 2 mil today. Roughly 8% short. 8 + 75 = 83% of outstanding shares, not including however much Retail is holding.  
  
Idiots holding short positions are so fucked as soon as there is any kind of uptick with higher liquidity.,2022-06-10T00:37:57Z

$ZIM last couple of days haven&#39;t been ideal. Bought in at 59.29 a couple of months ago after the dividend pay out sell-off. Saw the 4.5% drop in Pre trading hours a couple of days ago so set my stop-loss at my cost. Collected probably $20ish dollars in divs last year and 2.85 this year per share so not too bad. Going to wait and see how the next two weeks play out and decide on when to buy in again. I don&#39;t feel the slaughter is over yet but could be wrong. In the likely event that there&#39;s a similar div paid out next year, anything in the low 40s is a deal. From a personal standpoint, it sucks waking up every morning and not owning this stock lol.,2022-06-09T23:46:53Z

$ZIM big bounce coming tomorrow.   Easily back to $70.,2022-06-09T22:25:00Z
$ZIM I thought it was a good entry point yesterday. Today was good too. It just paid a dividend, so it will probably be a little while before it jumps back up. Patience is all it takes.,2022-06-09T22:23:49Z
$ZIM  lol zim is goldmine if you don‚Äôt see it ‚Ä¶   go Do your homework,2022-06-09T22:21:58Z
$ZIM I know, it&#39;s a stock that many of you love, but I commented on it briefly yesterday, with little response. That&#39;s fine, it was expected.  
 
I get it. but quite frankly it looks to me like this stock is under heavy distribution. 
 
It&#39;s only my two cents. I won&#39;t keep going on about it.

$ZIM don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve ever seen a company hit a TTM P/E of sub-1, except maybe those charged with fraud.

I don&#39;t think there&#39;s fraud going on here.,2022-06-09T21:39:42Z
$ZIM cant believe i got another chance at this stock below 60. with 14 eps only in the 1st quarter. most likely a 2 year return on my capital. just looking at baltic dry index, apr-jun prices are so much higher than jan-mar,2022-06-09T21:07:44Z
$ZIM first buy today. hope it to hit under 50. will buy it tons,2022-06-09T21:02:07Z
$ZIM Market cap currently $6.3 Billion, Shareholder Equity $4.2 Billion, Free Cash Flow $1.5 Billion.  This is a cash cow that is making money hand over fist.  This dip is simply an opportunity to buy low.,2022-06-09T21:00:37Z
