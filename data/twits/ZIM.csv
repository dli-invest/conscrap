$ZIM I posted when freight rates for containers were dropping and said ZIM was a sell. Now I see a bottom forming with rates. Banks cutting targets. Probably goes higher now,2023-04-23T21:53:47Z

Re: JPM analyst Samuel Bland

‚ÄúZIM Integrated Shipping (NYSE:ZIM) -3.9% in Friday&#39;s trading as J.P. Morgan downgraded to Neutral from Overweight with a $20.80 price target, slashed from $27, expecting the stock to lag its peers from a profitability perspective over the next 2-3 years due to high costs related to ship charters.‚Äù,2023-04-23T20:28:09Z
$ZIM A very conservative valuation that halves current operating cash flows and cuts the normal metric of 10x CF to 1/3 to 3.33/EV would result in a share price of $56. It may be the most undervalued stock anywhere. In any case, $ZIM should be trading between $40 and $60 a share.,2023-04-23T16:32:27Z

$ZIM I have a question about my ZIM transactions.  I sent a message to IBKR today after I bought around 2500 shares(today) hoping to recapture the losses I had post dividend(because I don&#39;t need any more losses)  I had 2600 share through Xdividend date and was properly paid.  After that on the 5th and 6th of April I sold all the shares at around $19.   So I got $16,640 in dividend(minus foreign tax) and had a $7,800 capital loss.  I was assuming my purchase would recapture that loss, but I do not see that reflected in the usual way on IBKR.  Is it not a wash sale somehow?,2023-04-21T23:39:17Z

@TheContrarianOne It is not bizarre. $ZIM benefited in 2021 and 2022 from abnormally high prices for shipping containers. Those prices have come back to earth and the company&#39;s outsized profits have disappeared.  
 
There are a lot of people on stocktwits that refuse to believe that and still dream of future $6 dividends. The earnings for Q1 2023 are supposed to be only about 25% of Q4 2022 earnings.  
 
Read the Q4 earnings announcement and notice how they forecast the profit for the whole of 2023 to be less than the profit for Q4 2022. 
 
Once you take that into account, the pricing starts to make sense. A lot of people are simply waiting to see the Q1 earnings and get a feel of expectations for the future,2023-04-21T20:35:40Z
