$ZIM as expected..... pullback is normal...,2022-03-24T05:09:08Z
$ZIM I&#39;m new to stocks that pay out large dividends once a year. I sold before the ex date and haven&#39;t bought back my shares yet. Now I know what to expect next time an opportunity like this comes around. It didn&#39;t crash and burn after the ex date like a lot of other stocks that pay out huge, so that&#39;s proof that it really is a good company. Now I&#39;m having regrets I didn&#39;t go in with my entire account and hold through the ex date. Maybe next year.,2022-03-24T03:58:36Z

$ZIM I suspect ZIM is back to 90 or so over the next 1-2 months. Own this for the growth not the dividend - but if you think that sort of payout isn&#39;t pretty spectacular you are a DOPE!,2022-03-23T23:59:59Z

$ZIM,2022-03-23T21:14:18Z
$ZIM $17 dividends are fucking  horse shit all it did was allow dumb shit shorties and greedy fuckers to pull out and manipulate the price of a $90 stock with perfect fundamentals and hold it down i will never partake in a double-digit div again especially when a foreign entity is involved,2022-03-23T20:35:45Z
$ZIM ** About when does everyone expect this to be at about $85? ** I want to get mostly out of this as soon as possible. I borrowed money and used margin to buy up lots of shares for the dividend. Then when I saw the huge profit I was making, I made up my mind to sell and rebuy before the ex div date. I however was waiting for it to go to 90 or 91.50 and it never did (it reached like 20 to 30 cents less max) and I fell asleep during those hours. The horror when I woke up and saw that long downward line graph showing it dropped to $80 something. I still sold, but made about $600 and change instead of like $1400 and change!!

Anyhow, I re-bought 100 shares before the ex div date and am now at negative $1,000, with an average of almost $83. I have been buying during the dips.

OK. This is enough. Just wanted to vent a little, tired of staring at this, and just want to put everything back in order as quickly as possible -- repay the loan and use way less to no margin.,2022-03-23T20:24:00Z
