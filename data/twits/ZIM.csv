$ZIM Iâ€™m fascinated by this stock. I realize itâ€™s all about shipping rates, and stock price could get cut in half again. It will be interesting to watch the dividend if that happens. No position,2022-09-09T03:50:50Z

$ZIM is valued rather cheaply when comparing the Enterprise Value to EBITDA ratio to the industry average of 2.93. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/ZIM/fundamental-analysis?key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-09-09T02:20:00Z

$ZIM looks like a great buy. Theyâ€™re printing money ðŸ’° right now having generated nearly the market cap in profit through the first 2 Q of â€˜22 (&gt;$3B profit)â€¦ the recession narrative has sunk the stock recently, but even if volume/revenue is cut in half, itâ€™s a buy.
