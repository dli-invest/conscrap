$ZIM 

Accounting for $100 million in loans, ZIM had around $3 billion of net cash on its balance sheet at the end of the most recent quarter -- for a company that is valued at $2.65 billion, that is incredible. Note that this does not account for ZIM&#39;s lease liabilities, which total $3.02 billion.

But as JPM and many others have argued, including these lease liabilities in the net cash calculation does not make a lot of sense -- ZIM does not pay any interest, and the lease liabilities go hand in hand with an asset-like right of use for the respective vessels. ZIM&#39;s current net cash position is thus larger than its market capitalization -- which means that the company is clearly priced for a downturn.

If ZIM burns through half its current cash position over the next two years, which is a pretty bearish estimate, I believe, then ZIM would still hold a net cash position of around $1.5 billion at the end of 2024 -- or close to 60% of the current market capitalization.,2023-02-21T21:39:29Z

$ZIM I said many times how market was way over blown and needed a desperate check. Elites kept pushing the market up knowing the economical situation was dire. They lied about the economy. Go figure.,2023-02-21T17:33:27Z
$ZIM Shorties are trying really strong now. 
By the way I love how the entire US market is red after &quot;Walmart&#39;s outlook disappoints&quot;, but $WMT itself is up +0.5%. 
Nice logic there.  
Shitty shorties grabbing every single opportunity to push the market in red for 0 reason.,2023-02-21T17:07:41Z
