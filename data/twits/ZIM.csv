$ZIM  Going into such uncertain times and not knowing what shipping rates will be, I consider it irresponsible to even consider a share buyback. Some shipping companies may go out of business and I don&#39;t want ZIM to be one of them. Some on this board will disagree but I am in favor of suspending the dividend which would be responsible and prudent at least until it&#39;s clear that a worldwide recession has been avoided.,2022-10-16T18:49:59Z

$ZIM These prices can be defined as gift in the near future. Locking the dividend yield in a very high yield percentage looks a smart move for me. I will plan to add more shares with divis in the future. Lets see how my strategy will work ü§û,2022-10-15T06:38:25Z
