Do you want higher equity returns or more affordable shares of ZIM Shipping Company?

The last quarter&#39;s dividend was $2.95. There are automatic taxes removed for the Israeli government of about 25%. There is no way around this for UK, EU, and USA investors. 

Expect to have this Zim Put option exercised and lose the next dividend if numbers are close. This stock is extremely volatile. Do not build too large a Zim position to be comfortable. The 52 week high for the stock is $91.23. 

I expect this stock to be run by short sellers about twice a year. It is not for the faint of heart, but the income stream is impressive.

Sell a Zim Shipping Put option dated 07/21/2023 with a $35 strike delivering a premium of $18.41. The non-exercised option income based on today&#39;s market price of $16.99 is 108.36% or an annualized return of 185.76%.

In the event the option is exercised, your net share cost is $16.69. The savings is $.30.,2022-12-20T21:42:46Z

$ZIM &quot;The average 2023 earnings estimate for ZIM is $4.87, which implies a year-over-year drop of 87% and a forward P/E ratio of 3.6 X. The earnings estimate trend is very negative, and forecasts for FY 2024 indicate expectations for a deep earnings recession. Based on the FY 2024 EPS estimate of $0.80, ZIM has a P/E ratio of 21.8 X which might make the shipping company still expensive.&quot;,2022-12-20T17:27:39Z

$SNDL Sold my bags and reinvested it all in $ZIM yesterday.  I love the fundamentals but this is going to reverse split again.  I&#39;ll be a buyer in a few months when its down to $0.80.
