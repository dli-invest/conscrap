$ZIM ZIM Integrated: New Shipping Act Will Not Hurt Long-Term Profitability 
In my last article on ZIM, I explained why the stock is a long-term buy. Based on my estimations, ZIM is worth more than $65 per share. 
A 28% drop happened in three days as investors expect Congress to vote soon on the Ocean Shipping Act of 2022, which will ban carriers from leaving U.S. ports with empty containers. 
ZIM’s revenues will not be hurt by the new act. The company operates on a global scale. It can reallocate its vessels to benefit from the market condition. 
Also, 43% of the company’s trade exposure by carried TEU is immune to the Ocean Shipping Act of 2022. 
I expect the freight rate from the U.S. to Asia and Europe will increase soon.,2022-06-14T18:29:18Z
