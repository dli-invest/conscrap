$ZIM Reached my accumulation goal last month but continue to add 1 share a day with dividend yield at 175%. Looks like bottom is in.,2023-01-11T03:52:24Z
$ZIM looks like it bottomed out. ZIM was heading for 100 dollars a share almost a year ago.  REMEMBER, this company promise to pay 30 to 50% of it profit in dividend to investors, last year they paid almost 30 dollars per share.  Investors are realizing that and are now holding it. You simply cannot lose buying it this cheap.,2023-01-11T02:46:27Z
$ZIM $12 stock price after next ex-dividend date,2023-01-11T02:42:22Z
$ZIM if i didn‚Äôt have to work during stock market hours I could easily make a fortune day trading this stock. Could easily make .70 a share or more every day like the shorts are doing. Do not panic sell( everyone who can‚Äôt daytrade)!!!!!,2023-01-11T01:30:58Z
$ZIM Book Value Per Share (mrq) $48.40 with approx $32/sh in cash. ZIM stock price will be at least $37.16 by or before 3/8 which is still undervalued, but a nice move up from here. LBO by KEN and Court may be a factor.  Where my cheerleader outfit at!,2023-01-10T23:29:18Z

Maersk Shipping is experiencing a pullback. Today&#39;s market price for Zim increased 2.36%. Expect price dips to spread to other shipping companies including Zim, Golden Ocean, and Hapag Lloyd. Diana Shipping may have less exposure the container income losses ahead. 
 
Container rates have decreased in a very significant amount. The largest drop since 1984. The result will be a buying opportunity for this sector after the container rates stabilize. Their fuel costs are relatively safe. 
 
Watch this closely and place GTC orders at prices under the 52 week lows for all shipping sector stocks. Check for future dividend cuts prior to buying any shipping stock.,2023-01-10T18:24:46Z
$FXLV $TNK $RIG $SHIP $ZIM Let&#39;s NOT forget how grossly incompetent Seeking Alpha author Henrik Alex is. Henrik Alex recently advised investors to sell FXLV at $1.35 in his article below.  
 
And FXLV has risen about 150% since his STRONG SELL recommendation, standing now at about $3.20, see his bearish article:https://seekingalpha.com/article/4526121-f45-training-holdings-stock-equityholders-facing-perfect-storm,2023-01-10T18:05:25Z

Big opportunity to capitalize on the current roadblocks with 40Seas integration with ZIM Frieght Services.

- A host of financing-related issues have historically undercut the fast-growing SME cross-border trading industry, such as siloed banking jurisdictions, working capital constraints, trust issues, legacy processes, interest rate gaps and FX volatility. The recent market downturn, and the rising cost of capital, has put an additional financial strain on SMEs engaged in global commerce.,2023-01-10T17:32:47Z
