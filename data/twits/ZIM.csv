$ZIM is valued rather cheaply when comparing the Enterprise Value to EBITDA ratio to the industry average of 2.92. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/ZIM/fundamental-analysis?key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2023-03-16T22:04:00Z

$SPY $ZIM üëÄ big dividend.,2023-03-16T21:28:54Z
$ZIM Am I looking at this stock and it&#39;s dividend correctly? 
 
With today&#39;s closing price of $24.54USD and the dividend of $6.40, we have subtracting the 25% tax which knocks the dividend down to $4.80. 
 
A $4.80 dividend on a $24.54 stock is a 20% dividend, and it is the only one of the year so far. 
 
Am I missing something?,2023-03-16T21:09:02Z

$ZIM are investors here going to DRIP or hold onto the divvy and wait for a reentry point to reinvest it?

I&#39;m on the fence as I&#39;d imagine shorts would hit this stock right after ex-div,2023-03-16T20:30:38Z
$ZIM 6.40 a share dividend...I&#39;ll take that lol,2023-03-16T20:22:25Z
$ZIM Here is an IDEA. Stop, pls stop talking here, AT LEAST, NO SPAM, no 100 twits per minute. Be boring, be quiet, like $KO , like some big names, if you understand.  
We are even TRENDING 5-10 times per month.  
Of course all bots, shorts, etc., will find us and, you know, AMC, meme, etc.   
ZIM is small cap company, and shorts doing whatever they want (especially after divs) all day long.  
Please, if some of you reading this, let&#39;s be quiet. 1-5 posts per month.  
Hope you understand my point of view.  
Tnx.,2023-03-16T20:05:16Z
$ZIM Tomorrow will break through $25,2023-03-16T20:05:05Z
$ZIM What a great finish. Outside influences were all over the place. ZIM finished where it wanted to be. Some shorters will lose their SHORTS today. Should be moving up at some point tomorrow. Not by a little. 25 plus. Just guessing. Monday will be very interesting as ex div or T2 from div record encroaches.,2023-03-16T20:03:24Z
