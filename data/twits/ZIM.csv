$ZIM what do the indexes going down a certain % have to do with any ticker ? Dude below has no clue how they work.üëá,2022-10-20T00:11:49Z
$ZIM market goes does 1% this goes down 4% Just look at the sketchy price action nobody is touching this idk why,2022-10-20T00:04:27Z
$ZIM honestly probs not even worth touching cuz it‚Äôs just dragging down harder than the market. Look at the price action it‚Äôs just weird and no liquidity.  I‚Äôll buy at 10,2022-10-20T00:03:29Z
$ZIM New 13f filings show 359 Institutions now holding 51,985,413/shrs which is 65% of the float! Short interest going into Q3 earnings is 15% of the float. If you want to help the cause, put in a GTC order to sell all your shares at $100 or $200 share. It doesn&#39;t matter other than your sell order reduces the the number of shares available to short 1 for 1 and also increases the fee that shorts have to pay. Currently only 700,000 shares available to short at 1.3% borrow fee. Please help the cause by putting in a sell order at any price and let&#39;s start the squeeze!,2022-10-19T23:35:36Z

$ZIM this price action can be explained by Hedge Funds shorting, period.  When technicals and fundamentals aren&#39;t making sense it&#39;s the large hedge funds that just short and short and short and short,2022-10-19T16:08:26Z
