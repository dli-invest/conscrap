Anyone else like $DAC over $ZIM ? DAC just came on my radar after an article about them dumping ZIM stock. Their earnings seem solid going back many years, as i understand it they are going to have zero debt soon and will have cash for a buyback. This seems more solid in terms of earnings and less cyclical that companies like ZIM.  
 
Thoughts? Or am i missing something about DAC? Not seen much on it but i&#39;ve liked what i&#39;ve seen so far.,2022-11-13T05:47:15Z
$ZIM you all need to loosen up like $ASTS. IMO this pays the best dividend I&#39;ve ever heard of. Average around 36. I know. But not really worried. Going to hold through ER and on. Best to all of you but we&#39;re bouncingüòéüòéüòéü§ë,2022-11-13T05:23:24Z

$ZIM People don&#39;t really do their DD over ZIM... Some common misconceptions I&#39;d like to cover... 
 
1. BDI doesn&#39;t really matter for ZIM- that&#39;s for dry bulk

$ZIM Anyone hear of that Black Oak Arkansas song &quot;Zim Dandy to the Rescue&quot;,2022-11-12T12:38:53Z
$ZIM so now we have the mystery solved of why $ZIM dumped so irrationally in Q3- https://seekingalpha.com/article/4556411-danaos-sold-off-zim-stake-net-debt-focus-buybacks?mailingid=29675515&amp;messageid=must_reads&amp;serial=29675515.136365&amp;utm_campaign=Must%2BReads%2BNovember%2B11%2C%2B2022&amp;utm_content=seeking_alpha&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=seeking_alpha&amp;utm_term=must_reads

The decision of $DAC to liquidate their position likely put unique downward pressure on the stock while in a natural downward trend from the ridiculous highs of Q2. This almost certainly means that the push into the 20s has been a huge overshoot in the sell off. Either that or some inside information of a big issue was used to front run Q3. I guess we will know on the 16th but the above certainly explains the huge overselling vs. peers given $DAC ‚Äòs huge previous position,2022-11-12T11:36:22Z
