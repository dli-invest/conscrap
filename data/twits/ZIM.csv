$ZIM once quarter is released I think this trades at p/e of 7. Legit question- are there geopolitical (Israeli) reasons for why this stock is held down compared to peers?,2022-07-28T17:16:47Z
$ZIM $ZIM both bulls and bears have it wrong. Those expecting a home run to $150 bucks are just wrong, on the other hand bears are in my opinion getting ahead by discounting that 2023 is going to be the annus horribilis for these companies. Its not going to be a smooth sailing going back to normal, with rates at $7000 Asia to West coast at the weakest point of the year, to pretend that the stock is going to halve from here is just wishful thinking for shorts. Cramer has no idea how the industry works, he is basically implying that if $ZIM pays $17  when priced at $50, that the stock will go to $25, he has probably seen the price action of the stock and tried to put two and two together. Cramer burnt half of his viewers when recommending $NAT at $8, he even had the audacity to invite the CEO and pounded the table like he only can when the stock was at $7!! I don&#39;t know why people follow him . The way things are $ZIM can easily double from here. Too much negativity on the stock,2022-07-28T16:58:31Z

$ZIM other shipping companies reporting blowout earnings. $NMM that has large containership exposure is flying due to huge share buyback and insanely high rates contracted. I don&#39;t expect anything much different from $ZIM soon.,2022-07-28T13:55:34Z

$ZIM Let&#39;s not get too excited. Obviously ZIM is an awesome company that is under valued for global reasons; no doubt. But the stock market is over blown. It will crash and ZIM will come down. ZIM will also steadily increase as dividend time gets closer. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised at $71/share or above. I would be surprised at $65/share or below. The so-called experts keep under valuing ZIM.,2022-07-28T12:31:06Z

$ZIM Looks ultra-bullish to me.,2022-07-28T10:51:59Z
$ZIM Higher freight rates have brought container shipping company Hapag-Lloyd an increase in profits in the first half of the year and made the executive board even more confident for 2022. The second half of the year is also expected to exceed previous expectations, Hapag-Lloyd announced on Thursday. As a result, the management now expects operating earnings (Ebit) of between 16.3 and 18.2 billion euros for 2022. However, the executive board qualified that the forecast was &amp;quot;subject to high uncertainties&amp;quot; due to the war in Ukraine, disrupted supply chains and the effects of the Covid 19 pandemic. In the first half of the year, EBIT shot up to 9.1 (previous year: 2.9) billion euros. In April, Germany&#39;s largest shipping company had already significantly raised its EBIT forecast to 11.7 to 13.6 billion euros, three billion more than before, due to bubbling revenues.

This is good for ZIM too.,2022-07-28T10:17:08Z
