$ZIM dividend max predicted the latest dividend was going to be 1.50 and it was 2.95 they were off by double.  
 
The Q4 dividend will be weird because we have no idea what these pyromaniacs will do. Anywhere from $1.50 to $10 depending on how much extra they want to pay as a bonus.  
 
 
I am more concerned about the Q 1 dividend of 2023. Analysts are predicting earning will crater into the ground or disappear completely.  
 
I think thats wrong.  
 
Estimated earnings of $1.  
 
My estimate is $5 to $8   
 
 People will be floored and go &quot;BUT THE SPOT PRICE??? BUT THE SPOT PRICE???&quot;  
 
 I am watching history repeat boys. SPOT price don&#39;t mean shit when you enter into long term contracts.  
 
Thats how the oil industry survived in Canada. But the low prices drove out all the little guys so now we have 4 major companies controlling all the market share and the spot price is for the drilling rig plebs  that don&#39;t have access to pipeline contracts.,2022-12-16T00:23:48Z

My alerts for LARGE caps. I have timestamps + buy fills for everything What&#39;s my win rate?

I ONLY buy when Algos are tired of selling. How? I buy when &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; is low.

It&#39;s a simple strategy. Learn what &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; by Algos.

I don&#39;t make 100s of trades. I only buy when I get a confirmation. Ask me for the receipts. 

Next, I&#39;ll trade $ATVI + $CRWD + $SNOW + $ZIM + $NVAX,2022-12-15T23:07:28Z
$ZIM Looking at the charts its very clear this is a sell/hold price will reach 15.00 soon don&#39;t pay premium dividend is to lure you to buy at premium so when you down dividend payment ain&#39;t shit compared to your loss in value wait it out to buy not financial advice just common sense.,2022-12-15T22:47:36Z
$ZIM Tomorrow it should rise to $20.5. Seems unlikely now, I agree. But that&#39;s what max pain tells us (unless that 30+K open interest of puts was dumped today).,2022-12-15T20:48:38Z
$ZIM ..._ I believe $15 was the IPO price. Dividends are no longer guaranteed.,2022-12-15T20:32:29Z
$ZIM Long way but next year back to 50 üöÄ,2022-12-15T20:16:40Z
$ZIM nice to see new people entering daily but after 1 dividend I think most people realize what actually  happened, figure our 25% of their dividend is gone, sell the stock at a loss, throw in the towel and walk away. It&#39;s been a revolving door of new suckered every quarter.  
 
Why I ever held my shares? I didn&#39;t think it could go below book value. Why would it be possible? 
Because Let&#39;s vote to liquidate the company and pay out the proceeds to the share holders. The company is actually worth $80 to $100 share at literal face value of their cash and assets.  
 
Let&#39;s just crack the piggy bank and collect guys.,2022-12-15T19:58:56Z
$ZIM added 3k more shares at 17.83,2022-12-15T19:54:52Z
$ZIM I swear this stock price is manipulated in a psychological warfare operation. It just Wont give any opportunity to get out.  
 
It hasn&#39;t rallied over  5% anywhere since the summer.  
 
Ideally you wait after EX day, prices sag, you jump back in, ride a rally, get out before the next EX day, avoid paying the dividend tax.  Buy it back after ex day, theoretically you can do better then the dividend amount tax free like that.  
 
But this effer won&#39;t rally anywhere! Won&#39;t give us a chance to get the  fuck out!  
 
I think I have to sell day before next EX day no matter what.  
 
You lose money every every dividend.  
 
Fuckin this thing has to saltabilize somewhere. People think the bottom is $1? Yeah it just might be.  
 
Then it&#39;s too predictable to just ride every rally between dividends. It has to or it&#39;s going to hit zero eventually.  
 
I see a short squeeze being the only way out of the dividend trap at some point.. 
 
It could be 1-3 years out who knows.,2022-12-15T19:53:51Z
$ZIM fed hiked 0.5% this week and projected to hike more. the borrowing fee and put premium is getting more expensive.,2022-12-15T19:35:30Z

$ZIM this is holding strong
Possible to close green today,2022-12-15T19:02:23Z
$ZIM 19 red candles out of 23 daily candles. Can we get a new 52 week low? The beat goes on.  Only good thing going on is volume is really low and so far 17.50 held up.  I guess 4 billion in cash allows ZIM to get a generous evaluation of 2.1 billion market cap,2022-12-15T18:32:10Z
$GOGL swag , shipping stocks rule. 

5-10 year for BDI is at all time lows macro bottom. 

Buying shipping stocks here is a decent long bet
