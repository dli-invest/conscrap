$ZIM how does the dividend work here? Is it monthly or quarterly? It says the ex-dividend date was 11-28 so if it was just paid out when&#39;s the next one? I&#39;ve never bought a dividend stock and I&#39;m not sure how it works.,2022-12-09T03:34:09Z

$ZIM 12 periods ago I posted where this had to go for a possible buy, but it never reached it and started a downtrend. I don&#39;t have an entry now because as long as it is trading under the 5 day (green line), it will continue to downtrend. When there is a turnaround, I hope to post a new chart with my strategy and price target. Have a great day,2022-12-09T00:38:31Z
$ZIM my Wells Fargo account received the dividend a few days ago and was worth $2.95/share AFTER withholdings. Received $885 on 300 shares, $200 something was withheld‚Ä¶so dividend was worth over $3.00/share pre tax I believe.,2022-12-08T23:52:54Z

My alerts for LARGE caps. I have timestamps + buy fills for everything What&#39;s my win rate?

I ONLY buy when Algos are tired of selling. How? I buy when &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; is low.

It&#39;s a simple strategy. Learn what &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; by Algos.

I don&#39;t make 100s of trades. I only buy when I get a confirmation. Ask me for the receipts. 

Next, I&#39;ll trade $ATVI + $CRWD + $SNOW + $ZIM,2022-12-08T20:11:10Z
$ZIM we need more shareholders to invest there dividend.  Why isn‚Äôt management not buying with there dividend?  They own 30 percent of the company but haven‚Äôt scene one share purchase since they went public.  That means they collected 900 million in dividends the last year and bought zero shares of ZIM.,2022-12-08T19:48:32Z

$ZIM Exxon is doing its second buyback this year.  Look how well it‚Äôs stock has done with a 4 percent dividend and buybacks.  Yet ZIM with a 130 percent dividend is down 65 percent where XOM is up 60 percent this year.,2022-12-08T19:39:22Z
$ZIM I see bagging one bull per tick chart pattern,2022-12-08T19:15:05Z
$ZIM so ZIM pays out a 360 million dividend and we have 4 million volume which is 76 million going back into the shares.  Even a blind man can figure out that ZIM is losing value because of the ridiculous dividends.  Warren Buffett won‚Äôt invest in companies with crazy dividends because he says it distorts the share price.  Why does management think there smarter then Warren Buffet at stocks?,2022-12-08T18:51:18Z

$ZIM 
Learned a lesson today. Do not DRIP ZIM, take the cash and buy the additional shares yourself. TDA finally gave me my shares today, but @ 18.75. Had I got the cash in account yesterday, I definitely would have bought &lt;18. Lesson learned here.
