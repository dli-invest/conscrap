$ZIM anyone else see a cup and handle forming?,2023-03-06T20:50:01Z

$ZIM The divvy will still be real and soften the pain . 2$ - 5$ ?,2023-03-06T20:37:11Z
$ZIM damn these MM&#39;s they played it from $25 to $21.5 in a week before earnings. Was unexpected. I am all loaded up, hope this thing at least touches $27 next Monday.,2023-03-06T20:28:28Z
$ZIM the lack of run up to earnings has been abysmal and it‚Äôs become increasingly apparent that this ticker is fully controlled by short sellers,2023-03-06T20:26:49Z
$ZIM I block all those who ask when is the next dividend, and how much it will be. Saves time later scrolling through posts by people who are completely clueless.,2023-03-06T19:43:21Z

$ZIM I won&#39;t be sending you chocolate or flowers for all the additional money you&#39;re making me by increasing the discount I will receive unless you force it sub 21.50. only a few days left to accomplish this!

You&#39;ll instead be receiving strongly worded termination letters (I know you&#39;re working for me for free, but that doesn&#39;t mean you cannot be fired!) instead, with a box of my poop!

I don&#39;t like leaving large piles of money laying around for days without it working for me in some manner.,2023-03-06T19:03:57Z
