$ZIM gotta love the&quot;this is going to $30&quot; crowd. Share price is reduced in concordance with dividend paid. It&#39;s basic financial knowledge. Dividend isn&#39;t accretive or compounding. Cash dividends result in cash haircuts to share price.,2023-04-07T15:05:38Z
$ZIM  FYI….I received my dividend during the night. Etrade.,2023-04-07T13:59:36Z
$ZIM just to let you all know that I purchased the shares om the Friday before the exdividend date and I was still paid the dividend. @PennyWeasel was right 👍,2023-04-07T13:49:00Z
$ZIM Just letting everyone know I have E-Trade and the dividend was paid last night less the 25% tax. 😎,2023-04-07T13:35:39Z
$ZIM still no dividend at Chase. Sold a lot of shares on the 24th and rebought 4000 shares on the 29th to sell 3000 on the 4th. Big fat L if this dividend doesn’t come through,2023-04-07T13:21:25Z
$ZIM any Etrade people not have their DIVI hit yet?,2023-04-07T13:13:30Z
$ZIM Is there anyone out there that can explain to me why I received the full $6.40/share dividend in my e-Trade account, but I only received $4.80/share dividend in my RobbingDaHood account?,2023-04-07T12:14:19Z

@Jessdog77 @pawgvixen #2 that is exactly how it works and always has! The amount of dividend paid is adjusted next day opening, now whether it stays there is another thing. $Zim rose over %10 next day, then fell 9% after that.,2023-04-07T06:16:05Z
$ZIM You will find a link here to submit a complaint about your broker to the NYSE: https://www.nyse.com/regulation/complaints-and-inquiries 
 
According to the NYSE due-bills only apply to shares that were sold before the ex-div date. They exist so that the dividend may be passed to the new buyer. If your broker uses due-bills as an excuse for not paying you, they are being dishonest and probably don&#39;t want to give the true explanation (which might be that they loaned your shares out and have to wait for a short seller to pony up the dividend. 
 
If you write to NYSE, I suggest you also post a copy to your broker.,2023-04-07T03:39:58Z
The Price/Earnings Ratio is 0.45, which indicates a rather cheap valuation of $ZIM. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/ZIM/fundamental-analysis?key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2023-04-07T02:08:00Z
$ZIM I know some others are looking for a few divy stocks to build their long side. Here&#39;s an idea for ulya. Hope it helps.. ec. Ecopetrol. It&#39;s an oil company. Pays good divys. Has been beat down with oil prices. And oil will do nothing but go up from here out as Saudi and world politics play the oil battle game.  Unlike pbr is not tied to Brazil govt. Entry on dips below 10. It&#39;s good to be spread around a bit. And long term looks good. Hope this helps.,2023-04-07T01:51:06Z
