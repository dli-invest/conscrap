$ZIM put this on your watchlist. Closed above the daily 50 sma and is now pushing against trend line resistance. Think this one goes much higher. Plus, it pays a fat dividend.

$ZIM was analyzed by 12 analysts. The buy consensus is at 78%. So analysts seem to be mildly confident about $ZIM. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/analyzer/stock/ZIM?view=analyst-ratings&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=ANALYST&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-05-28T06:33:00Z
$ZIM I have been thinking about the tax implications of the dividend for Canadian residents. I consider an investment of $100 that gains value of $50 *and* gives $50 of dividend over the same time period (similar ratio to ZIM). I assume 25% for the taxpayer marginal rate. 
 
In a taxable account, you pay capital gains tax of $6.25 plus $12.5 on the divi, for a total of $18.75. 
 
In a RRSP [like US 401k] you pay a whopping $50 in tax on withdrawal, as everything (including $100 principal) is taxed. 
 
In a TFSA [like US Roth IRA] you pay $12.5 in tax (withheld by Israel on the divi). 
 
So, the TFSA is still not too bad, so long as the price of ZIM is rising in line with the divi. You benefit from untaxed capital gains.,2022-05-28T05:23:28Z
