$ZIM  After cash, the business is essentially priced at zero, which is why it&#39;s very likely that private equity is positioning here... They generally avoid the shipping sector like the plague... But they&#39;re sooooo starved for yield and deep value,  they&#39;re actively positioning to take over shipping sector operators like ZIM... ZIM has no net debt, excellent long-term cash flow generation potential, it&#39;s trading at cash on-hand, and it&#39;s metrics are showing deeply undervalued forward valuations... Their model is flexible and their structure is streamlined and efficient...,2022-09-06T03:23:58Z

$ZIM  The bottoms feeders continue to spin their web of false and misleading representations... ZIM&#39;s leverage ratio is virtually zero... At the end of Q2 it was an amazingly low .1x, and their net cash position is equal to 90% of their current market cap... That&#39;s a crazy healthy balance sheet, especially for the marine shipping sector... And this is amplified by their massive positive cash flow, which after paying out $2.4 billion in dividends, it retained $743 million of cash flow to pay down debt. Nearly every analysis of ZIM accurately reflects ZIM&#39;s strong balance sheet...,2022-09-06T03:22:20Z

$ZIM What I don‚Äôt like about ZIM is that their debt is higher than their market cap and it‚Äôs also more than their cash. However, with Maersk and Hapag it‚Äôs not even 10% of market cap. Ppl keep saying all the positive but for some reason ignoring the debt portion.,2022-09-06T02:58:30Z

$ZIM  What&#39;s clear right now is that ZIM is suuuuuper cheeeeeap.... For 2023 is still very cheap, and for 2024 it&#39;s slightly undervalued...

$ZIM I am paying heavy attention to ZIM this week for a bounce, this company is financially healthy and historically rips inverse when it enter oversold and over bought ranges, if $SPY rips, ZIM is going to shred to resistance.,2022-09-05T20:58:31Z

$ZIM: The low PEG Ratio, which compensates the PE for growth, indicates a rather cheap valuation of the company. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/ZIM/fundamental-analysis?key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-09-05T18:08:00Z

$ZIM  A $40 Put expiring on 21 Oct sounds delusional-ly disconnected from reality... I&#39;d say $40 will be the average run rate through December, and it&#39;ll probably rebound to $45 before it runs... This put (if it actually exists) is a great example of irrational pessimism...,2022-09-05T15:55:02Z
