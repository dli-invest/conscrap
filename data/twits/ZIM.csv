$ZIM &quot;Jefferies analyst Omar Nokta maintains ZIM Integrated Shipping (NYSE:ZIM) with a Hold and lowers the price target from $21 to $20.&quot;  
 
With most of my stocks, I feel a little frisson of fear after I read news such as this, but not with ZIM. Because I want more ZIM, and I hope to get it very cheaply post-divi. And I know from this news that Jeffries wants the same. How come? They have set a price target 7% below the current price, meaning logically it should be a sell for them. They don&#39;t believe their own ratings.,2023-02-08T05:42:32Z

$ZIM What will it take to get the stock back to the $65 and up?  Not familiar with the shipping industry, but from what I gather the shipping rates have to go up?  Is that likely in this economy?  If not, I am thinking this is a company that will be here long term, so just stick with it and hold?,2023-02-08T02:20:33Z

$ZIM DOW is about to hit 34000 again. LOL. ZIM will shoot up again because the reports were garbage. YOYO! Still trending upward. As I said before end of Feb. before major upswing. Earnings report March 7th. It&#39;s going to be good.,2023-02-07T19:17:03Z
$ZIM No worries. Ya, never know what the scammer analysts are going to pull out of their --- next. Tomorrow could be a complete turn around with new perfect economy growing reports. It&#39;s all ---- Here&#39;s the morning ZIM report that as usual completely contradicts itself. Based on historical data. You sell and they buy your loss cheap.

$ZIM Powell basically implied pausing so strange to see how the market is trading today.,2023-02-07T18:46:05Z

What did Powell say that caused everything to drop ? It is not just ZIM.  So many other stocks have lost 3 % to % 5 in just the past half hour. 
The DOW was up 259 points and now it is down  
172 points, as of this writing.
