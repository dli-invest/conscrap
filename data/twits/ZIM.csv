$ZIM why is this not in the 200s? It has such a low PE and great revenue,2022-05-20T01:14:09Z
$ZIM at least I have added this morning 10% to my existing position. Looking forward to see this back at $80+ soon. Shanghai will reopen in 12 days…and the week after is dividend recording day…  tic toc,2022-05-19T23:55:31Z
$ZIM Remember to sell calls when we get to the end of the month with an exercise date say 6/17. Why? Because most stocks fall after the divy is paid out. Remember?,2022-05-19T21:54:50Z

$GOGL $ZIM $DAC $SBLK Uhh… Does anyone else feel this is super odd and sketchy?,2022-05-19T21:14:52Z
$GOGL I we said...$ZIM is a good company. $SBLK and $GOGL shareholders are getting played by insiders. Time will tell.,2022-05-19T21:03:37Z
$ZIM ... Reasons why we are headed to $120. 
--New IPO 
--Never done a reverse stock plit unlike $SBLK and $GOGL (look at their pps in 2007) 
--Lowest PE ratio in the industry 
--Operated by Israelites (honest and geniuses/mediators in world conflicts)  
--China is about to open up 
--Excellent revenues and earnings.  
--Gives back to investors in terms of dividends.  
--Listed in NYSE rather than the volatile Nasdaq,2022-05-19T20:39:40Z
$ZIM ... ZIM is marinating like Cajun seafood, chicken wings, and Beef BBQ (Prime rib) + pork ribs cooked on a pit. Served with a Caribbean tropical fruit salad and a Mexican tequila. Who&#39;s hungry now? Ilove this stonk.,2022-05-19T20:25:11Z
