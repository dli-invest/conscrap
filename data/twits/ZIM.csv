$ZIM they should give dividend and make share buyback ..,2022-09-01T19:41:07Z
$ZIM Keep in mind, folks. The last dividend of $4.75 reduced your ZIM asset value by $1.19/share. Really think about it. If a fund had 100,000 shares, they&#39;d reduce their portfolio value over $100,000. Some dividend? A fool&#39;s game. You&#39;d be better off by selling your shares just prior to the ex&#39;dividend payout day, and then buy them back $1.19 cheaper.,2022-09-01T19:39:07Z
$ZIM wanted to go long 35.5  but this movement is just awful.,2022-09-01T19:36:47Z

$ZIM Going back to 45,2022-09-01T17:19:30Z
$ZIM Is it possible to get to penny stock status just based on the divvy payout alone? Every time a divvy pays, the stock drops by that amount. So if it keeps this up, it could theoretically drop to nothing. Just a question.,2022-09-01T17:11:33Z

Crazy to say even after I sold $STEM and $TWLO this morning for a decent loss I&#39;m up on my swing trades today $SQQQ &amp; $HIBS. Sold the 2000 $SQQQ at just over $38 and still holding the 2000 I grabbed this morning at $46.16 and just sold the $HIBS at $9.56. So today&#39;s not so bad for my trades bad news is $ZIM and $TWLO core positions are getting heavier and heavier GL,2022-09-01T16:00:14Z
$ZIM if this breaks $35 support there‚Äôs not much below. Timber as they say,2022-09-01T15:56:39Z
