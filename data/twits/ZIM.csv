@matt6g @mike325 @midnight12 the OCC publishes memos well before the adjustment date.   The last memo on $ZIM was from March of last year for the 17.00 dividend, where they specifically state that option prices will not be adjusted for companies that pay large regular dividend.  This is not a special dividend, there is no memo, there is no options adjustment.

$ZIM this is a REGULAR  dividend,  ZIM has had 1 SPECIAL dividend,  their very first one, everyone after that has followed ZIM&#39;s declared dividend policy.....this one is &quot;special&quot; per the NYSE because it was greater than 25% of ZIM&#39;s stock value day before announcing the amount BUT it is not &quot;special&quot; regarding option pricing,2023-03-29T02:49:27Z

$ZIM Shareholders or newbies will have an epic friday and monday cause both are the last days to buy shares and receive dividend payment on april 4th‚Ä¶.. shorts will get burned on 6.40 usd or Even more‚Ä¶. Ex dividend date expect just a 4 usd recoil‚Ä¶,2023-03-29T00:53:12Z
$ZIM I keep seeing platforms show a 70+% dividend yield for this stock ticker, which seems objectively unreasonable.

Can anybody smarter than me explain why it shows this high of a dividend payout?,2023-03-28T23:08:43Z
$ZIM If I buy ZIM tomorrow will I still get the dividend? The ex-dividend date is April 3rd, but the record date is March 24th? Usually the record date is after the ex-dividend rate so I&#39;m not sure.,2023-03-28T21:36:56Z

$ZIM Not a lot of selling. Surprised shorts not buying yet to close out here. Very odd option activity even on calls. They might regret not closing out here. It looks as if they are trading with one another.,2023-03-28T18:10:07Z

$ZIM As I see it once  Zim goes ex div watch out  below. Steady  erosion like water torture down to a nice round number like $10 which would be a good entry point‚Ä¶,2023-03-28T17:52:18Z
$ZIM is this really a buy and hold forever stock?,2023-03-28T17:49:34Z
$ZIM The lower it goes, the more I can buy with my dividend. Going to hoard these shares for years to come.,2023-03-28T17:41:58Z
$ZIM Correct me if I&#39;m wrong. I went into the last year of dividends for $ZIM and looked at the price on date of dividend announcement tracked the increase to highest amount before ex dividend and tracked how much it fell end of day on ex dividend date.   
For March 22 $17 dividend. Good earnings. It climbed $17.32 from announcement to ex. Then dropped $12 EOD ex. 13.6% drop from high. 
May 22 $2.85 dividend. Good earnings. It climbed $8.23 then dropped $5.86 EOD ex. 8.4%. drop from high 
Aug 22 $4.75 dividend. Bad earnings. It climbed $0.42 then dropped $8.92 EOD ex. 18.5% drop from high. 
Nov 22 $2.95 dividend. Bad earnings. It climbed $0.10 then dropped $4.25 EOD ex. 16.6% drop from high. 
Current $6.40 dividend. Great earnings. It climbed $4.96 from announcement low $19.57 to best day end of day $24.53. if it has an 18% drop from high on ex dividend. That&#39;s roughly $4.50, which would put the price at $20 on end of ex dividend day,2023-03-28T17:29:19Z
$ZIM is it asking too much to close green for a day??,2023-03-28T17:19:54Z
