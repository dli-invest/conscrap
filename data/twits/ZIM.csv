What‚Äôs will happen to my total position 
If the stock open lower by 6.40 ???,2023-04-02T21:50:07Z
$ZIM Tomorrows agenda, shorty rushes to be the first to cover while dingalings who sold too early try to crawl back in in time to claim a divi spot. Institutional investors pile in last minute to to add a whopping divi payment to their already lagging portfolios to prop up the numbers. Massive buying pressure wave coming tomorrow, dont be left out! üö¢üíµüåä,2023-04-02T21:16:15Z

My alerts for LARGE caps. I have timestamps + buy fills for everything What&#39;s my win rate?

I ONLY buy when Algos are tired of selling. How? I buy when &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; is low.
I don&#39;t make 100s of trades. I only buy when I get a confirmation. Ask me for the receipts. 

Next, I&#39;ll trade $ATVI + $CRWD + $SNOW + $ZIM + $NVAX,2023-04-02T19:26:59Z

$ZIM question dividend

Suppose I buy 1000 shares ZIM tomorrow; that is for the ex-date, but on payment date. How do I get the payment then after all?,2023-04-02T16:39:56Z

$ZIM Still not super privy on this dividend payout.

Is there any share dilution when dividend are paid? This company&#39;s cash-to-debt ratio already points towards this being a great value add, and if the stock is dropping 6 dollars from here it&#39;s even more so.

Am I missing something or is this a long-play golden ticket?,2023-04-02T12:06:33Z
$ZIM be prepared for a big dip,2023-04-02T11:28:23Z

$ZIM So we get dividend of 6,4$ per share and stock could even drop to 15$ after divvy, sounds like good way to reinvest divs. Even if next div is only 1-2 bucks.,2023-04-02T03:23:07Z
