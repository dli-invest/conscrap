$ZIM Please help me understand. If the algo runs the stock down by selling it, and then buys it back, isn&#39;t that a net zero? Specifically, how do they make money on this?,2023-04-27T03:17:22Z

$ZIM directly on trendline and pointing downwards atleast the shorts and people who say EPS to 1.00 normalize means this could fall to 10... well see but i would likely keep a stop around 15.50 if you dont wana suffer a whole drop to the bottom of next box...,2023-04-26T22:11:50Z

$ZIM 

I bought today, correction could be finished. Played it last time for a 7k swing. If it breaks 16.25 I‚Äôm fucking out. That has to be the bottom or you‚Äôre going to dollar land. Good risk reward here, for a wave 3 of 3 higher. Good luck, but get the fuck out if 16.25 breaks guys.,2023-04-26T22:08:34Z
$ZIM I disagree if ones style is to keep accumulating shares in a great company. I don&#39;t think you can go wrong. Im not concerned with the volatile ups and downs of the price if I&#39;m always accumulating.,2023-04-26T22:02:47Z
$ZIM  below $17 is good price. If you get it at $10 that would be awesome.,2023-04-26T21:44:49Z

$ZIM I hear the same shit and see the same shit with this stock. I keep day trading it buying for under $18 and selling for $21+ and I make sure I&#39;m in for the dividend. I never have DRIP on because I can always buy it cheaper myself and repeat. So ty for the cheap shares.....,2023-04-26T21:37:25Z
$ZIM will start buy if we see 16.50 this week.,2023-04-26T21:08:38Z

Looks like the $ZIM euphoria following the last big dividend is gone. This shows that big dividends don&#39;t protect you against losing money.  
 
I learned that lesson with REITs: you can lose a lot of money investing in companies with dividend &gt; 10%,2023-04-26T20:44:12Z

$ZIM i sold my 4771 shares of zim today and bought riot with it. I believe between now and the next president being elected that riot will outperform zim. I will sell riot late next year and buy back into zim then when bitcoin hit a new all time high..,2023-04-26T19:50:15Z
My alerts for LARGE caps. I have timestamps + buy fills for everything What&#39;s my win rate?

I ONLY buy when Algos are tired of selling. How? I buy when &quot;HEAVINESS %&quot; is low.
I don&#39;t make 100s of trades. I only buy when I get a confirmation. Ask me for the receipts. 

Next, I&#39;ll trade $ATVI + $CRWD + $SNOW + $ZIM + $NVAX,2023-04-26T19:36:41Z
