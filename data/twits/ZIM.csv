$ZIM Personally, not the time to buy, maybe if you were to sell if you got it under 17.00 or around low 17.00s, but it will probably lower to that amount again.  Anyone into Wyckoff&#39;s?  Accumulation?,2023-01-18T20:09:03Z

&quot;17.5 close by this Friday&quot;. 
 
AN OBSERVATION: 
 
Anyone who would post such &quot;negative energy&quot; has no money invested in this security. 
In fact, you do not have any money invested in ANY securities, do you ? :) 
That is why you sit on the &quot;sidelines of life&quot; and criticize those who engage in reasonable risk. 
Best to everyone else. :),2023-01-18T18:29:16Z
$ZIM this junk will be lucky if it’s still even paying a dividend a year out.  recession will crush this junkany.  Imagine thinking a shipping company from isreal is great long term investment. 🤡🤡🤡🤡😂😂,2023-01-18T18:27:06Z
$ZIM Here&#39;s the latest. Not like those analysts will lie to you right? lol. : Jan 17 (Reuters) - Wall Street&#39;s main indexes opened lower on Tuesday after Goldman Sachs missed quarterly profit estimates, worsening sentiment already dented by downbeat economic data from China earlier in the day.,2023-01-18T18:26:49Z
$ZIM 17.5 close by this Friday.,2023-01-18T18:17:56Z
$ZIM last trade was 150 shares at .006.  Whatever will you do with your 90 cents?,2023-01-18T18:15:54Z
$ZIM Friday&#39;s max pain has dropped to $19 today, so that is (probably) where ZIM will end the week. After that, could go either way or sideways.,2023-01-18T18:10:03Z
