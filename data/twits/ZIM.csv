$ZIM Schwab won’t let me auto reinvest dividends :( guess I’ll just have to do it manually,2023-01-16T17:04:33Z
$ZIM just learning about dividends etc, is that right this has a 176% dividend yield? That seems crazy high?

So I would only need to invest $681/$682 to make $100 a month in dividends?,2023-01-16T15:51:23Z

$ZIM but it could be as simple as container rates over shorted and reality isn’t reflected in markets.. $jpm trying to cover saying barcoding for next two years to unwind.. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,2023-01-16T15:47:50Z
$ZIM the sad thing is airlines should be reporting the greatest amount of eps growth in history from air freight rates.. more profits to fly freight per kg than a person.. it’s like airline hiding profits… maybe from unions?? Or tax fraud?? Or from debt collectors?? Maybe a combination…. 200lb person paying $200 = $1 a lb vs 200lb  package paying $500 = $5 per 1lb… freight only going one way from manufacturer to consumer is the only explanation airlines dead heading back to manufacturer… but even so more profitable saving on fuel costs round trip.. airline love to lose money..,2023-01-16T15:43:41Z
