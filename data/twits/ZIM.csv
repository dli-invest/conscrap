$ZIM 

Anyone have any good divi stocks besides this one?  Sharing is caring. Lol. I got enough reits and closed end funds.  Looking for solid company with 15% plus divis. 

I have clm, crf, oxlc, orc, cim, wmc, zim as of now. 

Thanks!,2023-04-05T04:09:28Z
With a PE of 0.51, the valuation of $ZIM can be described as very cheap. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/ZIM/fundamental-analysis?key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2023-04-05T03:51:00Z
$ZIM did anyone got their divvy on webull?,2023-04-05T03:50:59Z
$ZIM just found this stock an hour ago. So are they really giving $16 a share in a year for dividend?,2023-04-05T03:50:05Z
$ZIM Decided to throw some of the dividend into my new Canadian portfolio to balance things a bit but dropped the USD on new shares, love this stock. Added another 7,948 shares thanks to dividend. Broke 50k+. Withholding tax was 25% so everyone needs to file those exhibits 99.2,99.3,99.4 to get the reduction paid to them after the fact.,2023-04-05T03:36:35Z

$ZIM what are we predicting for tomorrow?
Just curious on everyone&#39;s thoughts.,2023-04-05T01:39:58Z
$ZIM good day today for this as it went solid green in an overall down day in the market. With China opening back up and $ZIM &#39;s pipeline being solid until atleast 2024, I believe the stock will keep producing juicy dividends as long as they stick to 40% of income as div. My prediction is next divvy to be in the 1.25 to 2 range (fingers crossed).,2023-04-05T01:38:27Z

$ZIM I got the Divy last night in Fidelity Account.   I have some in Etrade and no Divy yet.    I notice all of my dividend equities get paid immediately by Fidelity but 2 or 3 days later at etrade,2023-04-05T01:21:31Z
$ZIM T D Ameritrade has not paid my accounts yet !    THEY waiting for price to go up to reinvest for me ?    looks like i getting screwd,2023-04-05T01:10:41Z
@sleezystockz @ruby2016  
Last thing you want to do is to DRIP $ZIM...  A lotta unhappy folks posting earlier today.  DRIP&#39;n in the 22&#39;s.  Next time and every time thereafter, take the cash and buy your own, most likely at much lower prices ($22.95 vs $19.40 🙄 ).  And yes, I&#39;m with Fidelity.  Got my cash this morning early AM.  Hope you don&#39;t get too screwed.  GL,2023-04-05T00:59:20Z
$ZIM any one using fidelity ?. My dividend is not reinvestes yet ?,2023-04-05T00:42:08Z
$ZIM how the hell we can receive 100 percent of dividend 6.40 instead of 4.80,2023-04-05T00:16:42Z
$ZIM Got mine Td Ameritrade and IBKR,2023-04-05T00:15:40Z
$ZIM nothing fundamentally wrong with this company. Shorts like to short companies with high yield who pay out fat dividends. People might be down on share price but depending on when you bought and if you reinvested the dividends you’re probably up on this, it’s a beast. While it’s under $20 I’ll keep buying a few a week and collect the nice dividends.,2023-04-05T00:15:13Z
$ZIM looking good 

I don’t drip the dividend, but couldn’t resist buying a few while it’s under $20,2023-04-05T00:02:13Z
$ZIM nothing for me TD Ameritrade,2023-04-04T23:34:59Z

Compared to an average Enterprise Value to EBITDA ratio of 3.14, $ZIM is valued rather cheaply. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/ZIM/fundamental-analysis?key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2023-04-04T22:48:00Z
$ZIM Anyone know when to expect they&#39;ll start teasing the next quarterly report and give an idea of the next dividend? I know the shipping rates are of concern this year, and the dividend is expected to go down. I&#39;m curious by how much,2023-04-04T22:33:23Z
$ZIM 3 months until the next dividend payment,2023-04-04T22:29:33Z
