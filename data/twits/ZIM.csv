$ZIM well, I&#39;m gonna go through the shitty tedious paperwork to reduce the 25% withholdings tax from Israel because I&#39;m going long here and as most know we are exempt from taxes on the first 80k per year of qualified dividend income.,2022-11-23T23:47:05Z

$ZIM made my decision. I will sell Friday. I will buy back Monday. I‚Äôll make my dividend payment via short trade, and avoid the tax. May even get extra from the price drop that will come via the ‚Äúgot my dividend now I‚Äôm out‚Äù crowd.,2022-11-23T20:52:17Z

$ZIM Management gets paid in dividends . Employees get paid in dividends.  Dividend will always be there.,2022-11-23T20:25:15Z
$ZIM I&#39;m hoping someone here (US Taxpayer) has experience with the Israeli tax withholding form. I completed the form and have all the documents requested. The only hangup I have is the &quot;PART B: CERTIFICATION OF FOREIGN INCOME TAX AUTHORITY&quot; section. Are they asking that I find my local IRS field office and have someone there fill this portion out? I don&#39;t know that they would give me the time of day? Unless this is standard operating procedure?,2022-11-23T18:44:07Z
$ZIM if ZIM management was smart they would announce a share buyback next week.  This would destroy the shorts and all these dividend flippers,2022-11-23T18:10:07Z
$ZIM Divvy was initiated on 8/21 when the stock was at $45. Since then, it has returned $32/share in dividends. What more could you want from an investment?,2022-11-23T17:10:22Z
$ZIM remember friends...if you want that sweet 3rd dividend...you must buy shares today or Friday.

The stock goes ex-dividend on Monday the 28th.

$ZIM people must really not read and understand their trading routes being profitable and the cash flow will continue through 2023. These analysts are lazy idiots who are usually late to trends and usually just hand waive to make drama where there is none to get investor phone calls and e-mails to charge them to spew idiotic commentary. That‚Äôs unfortunately the game that‚Äôs played.,2022-11-23T16:06:27Z
