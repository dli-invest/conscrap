Shanghai targets lockdown turning point by Wednesday, sources say 
 
Shanghai has set a target to stop the spread of Covid-19 outside of quarantined areas by Wednesday, two people familiar with the matter said. 
 
This would allow city to further ease its lockdown and start returning to normal life as public frustrations grow. 
 
The target will require officials to accelerate Covid testing and the transfer of positive cases to quarantine centers.

DWELL TIME AT THE PORT OF SHANGHAI,2022-04-16T21:26:50Z

Reduced manufacturing output, along with limited truck access to the port and airport, are causing a significant drop in air and ocean export volumes. Less demand is translating to lower freight rates. 
 
....some ocean carriers are skipping Shanghai port calls. 
 
...Maersk, the second-largest container vessel operator, said Thursday it has stopped accepting bookings to Shanghai for refrigerated cargo, some types of gas and flammable liquids. 
 
‚ÄúBut even if the lockdown persists and demand drops significantly, ocean carriers will likely reduce capacity which could keep rates from plummeting, just as they were able to do in the first few months of the pandemic when ocean volumes fell significantly but transpacific rates declined by less than 15% and were about level year on year,‚Äù it said. 
 
The supply chain is backing up like water behind a dam. When water is released, the landscape gets flooded.

Did not want to hear UNTIL JUNE: 
 
******** 
 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably worse than Wuhan,‚Äù said Jon Monroe, an ocean shipping and supply chain expert. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to have a lot of pent-up orders. It‚Äôs going to be an overwhelming movement of goods‚Äù that will drown shipping lines and ports once the lockdowns are lifted. 
 
Freight is piling up 
25 million people in Shanghai have been sequestered for 18 days. Chinese authorities this week slightly eased the restrictions, dividing the city into three categories based on previous screenings and risk levels. People can wander outside their apartment buildings but are encouraged to stay home in neighborhoods with no positive COV-19 cases in the past two weeks. Those in high-risk areas must still shelter at home. 
 
BBVA (Spain) predicts Chinese authorities will stick to the ‚Äúzero-COVID‚Äù strategy and lockdowns until at least June. Other China observers say it could take even longer to meet China‚Äôs infection standard.,2022-04-16T21:23:31Z

Container stocks 
Unlike other ocean shipping segments, container stocks have fallen by double digits since the end of Mar. 
 
They‚Äôve been weighed by the same consumer demand fears that are hitting the transport index, and have given back much of their YTD gains.  
 
However, to put the recent drop in context, container shipping shares have been the best-performing shipping equities since the onset of COVID. Just one example: On Thurs, stock of container-ship leasing company Danaos  closed down 17% from its high on Mar 28. Yet it was still trading 16 times higher than it was in Jan &#39;20, pre-COVID. 
 
Container-ship lessor stocks have fallen recently despite these companies boasting several years of contracted revenue booked at record rates, shielding them from exposure to a drop in consumer demand. They also have customers (the container lines) with record cash buffers, removing counterparty risk.

$ZIM: The low PEG Ratio, which compensates the PE for growth, indicates a rather cheap valuation of the company. https://www.chartmill.com/stock/analyzer/stock/ZIM?view=fundamental-analysis&amp;key=cccd8b2a-3183-4d1f-aada-01d6334cbf26&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=ZIM&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking,2022-04-16T04:39:00Z
