Also, what exactly happened with the Stelco impairement ... I&#39;m assuming financing is an issue here ?,2021-10-23T19:08:06Z

$POND.V has a great product in a growing industry. Add that to the multiple revenue streams; it looks pretty cheap at $20M. They recently completed a $1.5M offering which will also help fund current operations.,2021-08-24T19:28:16Z

$POND.V is way too cheap right now esp. with their recent announcement to produce C-19 antigens from micro-algae. 

Anyone else feeling extremely bullish about POND? Are we going to see a run soon?

$POND.V CO2 is the single largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and is a huge problem the world is facing right now. Being one of the few public companies that focuses on carbon capture, this green energy stock is game-changing imo. Their recent financials showed solid improvement, they have a tight share structure, and an innovative method to transform CO2 into algae-based products. My fav green tech stock right now!,2021-06-11T18:40:32Z
$POND.V For investors looking to get exposure to green tech, $POND is one to check out. 

One of the few public companies focusing on carbon capture, Pond profitably transform&#39;s CO2 from any source into valuable algae-based products such as bioproducts, food ingredients, or nutraceuticals. With algae expected to be the future of plant-based feeds for livestock, their resource efficient method requires minimal land and loses zero water. 

Their recent financial statement&#39;s for Q1 ending March 31, 2021 showed improvement and I expect this growth to continue as they have strong re-order levels, new clients onboarding, and increased order volume from customers. 

With the current climate crisis, the carbon capture industry will experience lots of growth in the future and this innovative method that uses greenhouse gases associated with global warming to create algae products will be huge.,2021-06-08T20:28:30Z
$POND.V is one of my favourite companies targeting the rapidly growing sustainability sector because of their unique technology. They use bioreactors to grow algae and reduce emissions with the algae while simultaneously harvesting the grown algae for use in other items such as medicine and plastics.
They have the idea and the technology to back the picture, all I’m waiting for now is for the company to scale the tech across the continent/globe. I’m not selling any shares at the current levels because I can see this being a $1.00+ stock in the future because of climate change concerns and the scaleability of $POND.V’s tech.,2021-06-03T21:16:00Z
