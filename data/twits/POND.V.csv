$POND.V has a great product in a growing industry. Add that to the multiple revenue streams; it looks pretty cheap at $20M. They recently completed a $1.5M offering which will also help fund current operations.,2021-08-24T19:28:16Z

$POND.V is way too cheap right now esp. with their recent announcement to produce C-19 antigens from micro-algae. 

Anyone else feeling extremely bullish about POND? Are we going to see a run soon?
