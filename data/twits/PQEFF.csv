$PQEFF guess there is nothing left to do besides buying as many more shares as I can for the next few weeks.  Hope my overnight GOOG calls payoff,2022-02-02T03:33:17Z
$PQEFF They will raise their offer.,2022-02-02T01:51:55Z
$PQEFF  Trying to understand how 150 million shares are added to the total and not listed as outstanding regardless if warrants, options,  etc.. I know there was issues with Petro management issuing shares below market price to pay for all sorts of costs and who knows what else that caused CAD shutdown .  The lack of transparency is I would imagine opening them up to serious litigation by shareholders maybe criminal actions ..,2022-02-02T01:00:53Z

$PQEFF everything is fine you dunces. They are extending because of a regulatory issue. All is well :),2022-02-01T23:52:46Z
$PQEFF On January 5, 2022, the Offeror made a voluntary filing with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”). CFIUS is a group of Cabinet-level officials in the U.S. government who are authorized to review certain transactions involving foreign investment in the United States, in order to determine the effect of such transactions on the national security of the United States. U.S. counsel to the Offeror was advised by CFIUS that January 13, 2022 would be the first day of the assessment period, which would conclude no later than February 11, 2022. During this period, the Offeror may be requested to provide additional information to CFIUS which may result in the extension of the period. 
 
From what I understand, CFIUS will conclude that all the paperwork is gucci by February the 11th so that could be the reason for extending slightly as well?,2022-02-01T23:46:15Z
$PQEFF Forgive my ignorance. Why wouldn&#39;t Viston simply take a bridge loan to purchase shares on the open market to gain the majority, rather than this 200+% premium? I&#39;ve tendered my shares but am leery about purchasing more and repeating - seems too good to be true.,2022-02-01T23:46:09Z
$PQEFF same deal, same price   
feb 7th means nothing now   
feb 28th (assume week prior for most brokers)   If you tendered  already your shares are the same as someone who tenders between now and your brokers new deadline,2022-02-01T23:38:14Z
$PQEFF What happens to the people who didn&#39;t tender their shares?  Will they still receive the same buyout price that tendered shares receive?  I would assume so.,2022-02-01T23:14:01Z

$PQEFF Today&#39;s annotated chart - HAMMER BOTTOM reversal candle,2022-02-01T21:32:52Z
$PQEFF this is where I bought the dip :) thanks to whoever sold me those shares.  I was supposed to be done after I tendered on Friday.  I&#39;ll take 2X my money any day of the week.  Even if it means I have to wait an extra month for it.,2022-02-01T21:29:12Z
$PQEFF So besides being mildly annoyed at not having funds to buy more and not having the buyout money to buy other stuff I had plans for my main concern at this point is this: 
What are the odds they&#39;ll extend again to shake out more people and get more shares tendered? It&#39;s not like people have many other options and I wonder if there is enough incentive (concern about another offer eventually materializing / opportunity cost of not having the technology yet / etc) for them to close ASAP.,2022-02-01T21:18:22Z
$PQEFF very unhappy about waiting another month. It is what it is I guess.,2022-02-01T21:16:53Z
$PQEFF Why haven’t they updated the petroteqoffer.com homepage? It still lists a deadline of 7 Feb. You would think they would be on top of that.,2022-02-01T21:09:30Z
$PQEFF i am not worried today. I believe, that the Deal goes trough.,2022-02-01T21:08:17Z
$PQEFF I just want to say that I understand everyone who is worried. But absolutely every stock has its risks, and the chance PQE offers you to make a solid profit is infinitely higher than it is anywhere else in the market right now.,2022-02-01T21:04:03Z
$PQEFF ...(Key points from Grant Hughes&#39; response) 
• There is always a &quot;massive spike&quot; in tendered shares 2-3 days before a tender offer deadline due to brokers tendering all the shares  which shareholders agreed to tender. 
• Kingsdale intend to notify shareholders if the &gt;50% mark has been passed BEFORE the deadline, however they must be cautious when doing this due to convertibles that could be converted but not tendered after announcing, so they&#39;ll probably play it safe. (This one was interesting, but I&#39;d be amazed if we got there before all of the brokers tendered),2022-02-01T21:01:21Z
$PQEFF What a beautiful Hammer bottom REVERSAL CANDLE was printed today.. I&#39;ll post the chart after the closing.,2022-02-01T20:58:52Z
$PQEFF hang in their petroteq people...,2022-02-01T20:56:37Z
$PQEFF I emailed Kingsdale and got an email back from Grant Hughes (President). Most of this is just supporting what @AcadiaValue has already posted for the responses to his questions (and others who have had a response from Grant). Key points below: 
• The extension WAS due to two regulatory reasons. One, the SEC reviewed the offer very late into the process and required tweaks to soften or remove conditions of the offer. Two, the CFIUS review and wait period must end before the offer expires. 
• The tendered share count in the press release did NOT include registered shares, beneficial shares OR convertible securities. 
(Part 2 to follow)...,2022-02-01T20:54:58Z
$PQEFF if viston and petoteq really wants to get this over the line, they should release a PR saying if any of the 144m shares belong to the bod(this includes blyumkin with around 55m shares).  
 
then they should get valkor to release their own PR to see if they intend to sell their 60m shares or whatever thats remaining after they sold it on the market(i doubt much though). 
 
assuming that the 144m doesn&#39;t include the bod and valkor shares and they fully intend to tender theirs as well, we would then have 144m + 55m + 60m = 259m confirmed tendered shares.  
 
meaning we only need 140m retail shares to get over the line which we almost most certainly will get. 
 
i don&#39;t understand how can two companies work so hard to get something done but still be so absolutely shit with their PR 
 
if you want people to be confident that the deal will go through and not delay tendering their shares then do something about it for christ sake.,2022-02-01T20:42:33Z
$PQEFF very important email sent out by kingsdale president 
 
the 144m shares are only paper shares. not shares held by any brokers which is the majority of it. this is good news,2022-02-01T20:07:50Z
$PQEFF sold all my 529000 shares today,don&#39;t like what&#39;s happening,2022-02-01T20:03:26Z
$PQEFF we get another month to buy shares from Valkor,2022-02-01T19:54:52Z
$PQEFF  goodbye my shares.  I tendered today.  Fidelity said their deadline is tomorrow.  Not sure if that will change.,2022-02-01T19:44:35Z
$PQEFF TD doesn’t officially tender shares until the expiration date….so those can’t be counted in the 144 million, right?,2022-02-01T19:42:59Z
$PQEFF Geez people...the new deadline is the 28th, the 7th means nothing now.  Also, Viston is not obligated to purchase all remaining shares if the reach 50% 1 tendered.  Dont get caught holding shares of a future private company thinking you are going to be rewarded with a higher offer.  Once they own 50% they have no reason to pay more per share.,2022-02-01T19:37:29Z
$PQEFF if Viston gets 50%+1 by Feb 7, do the people who have tendered get paid, or do we have to wait until Feb 28?,2022-02-01T19:31:53Z
