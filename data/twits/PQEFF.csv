$PQEFF ok so elephant in the room. They basically said our options are 

1) increasing SH value
2) &quot;alternative transactions&quot;

We have to be honest here. No pont in being in denial.

What would hypothetically happen if poison pill drops?

SP tanks, but company funded right? Either way I&#39;m not in it for the buyout but for the tech. So just hold until they use the funds to build infrastructure yeah?,2021-10-28T04:19:14Z
$PQEFF  
ABSOLUTELY NOONE:
ME:  I think they&#39;ll decline the offer and convince shareholders they can reposition themselves in the industry with more cash flow.
Dilution incoming? Just my thoughts, but I&#39;ve been insanely bearish on this company from the get go given thier track record with investors, and I don&#39;t think they deserve anyone&#39;s money. This stock is so interesting to watch evolve.... 

Consistent with its fiduciary duties, the Board will evaluate the Offer and Petroteq&#39;s options, including continuing to operate the business to drive shareholder value and potentially exploring possible alternative transactions.
The Board continues to believe Petroteq is well positioned to be an industry leader with its one of a kind oil sands extraction technology

GLTA I hope you make bank,2021-10-28T04:18:56Z
$PQEFF @Konstantinek1 i tried to share this idea reporting you call with Viston, the post i added stayed in that thread. 

Here&#39;s a solution i think is compelling,2021-10-28T03:57:46Z
$PQEFF. Is Viston wanting to take the company private?,2021-10-28T03:32:54Z

$PQEFF update letter is great. Petroteq is basically open to working out a deal that makes all shareholders a lot of money.

If they don&#39;t,  shares get tendered after the New Year. We still make a lot of money.,2021-10-28T03:04:02Z

$PQEFF looks like we should be expecting a Schedule 14D-9 in the next 8-9 business days? Please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.,2021-10-28T02:16:01Z
$PQEFF is this offer from someone new in addition to who PQ under NDA with?

Petroteq already posted offer on their Facebook pagetodayt. It&#39;s a legit offer and PQ taking it serious and endorses it.

So many hints Petro are open to multiple exit strategies that benefit shareholders.,2021-10-28T02:08:01Z

$PQEFF This stock is a monster!! https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/1107010-edward-vranic-cfa/5653461-petroteq-is-where-peak-fintech-was-back-in-2018?fbclid=IwAR1gTMErXl_68JHRGYNiMicjRr3kQ71zgl26Gc2OsolgyV67bvanw9Zg-q4,2021-10-28T01:49:54Z
$PQEFF ok so there are two scenarios I can think of to cause all this dumping when we will get 60 cents (or more) in 3 months.  Option 1: Since people need actual common shares it could be all the warrant/convertible debenture people dumping shares to get cash to buy.  No clue why they wouldn&#39;t get a loan from the bank instead but maybe they are hard up for cash.  Option 2: A hedge fund&#39;s algo bot has done fucked up BIG TIME and they are gonna figure this out soon and correct the mistake.  Either way this is a screaming buy for me.,2021-10-28T01:48:54Z

$PQEFF Daily short sale volume really low today. (ShortVolume.com is back?) Looks like ~9.6% today. Interesting. Does this lend to the idea that investors today thought the deal for U.S. $0.60 wasn&#39;t going to go through?,2021-10-28T01:44:45Z

$PQEFF lol that was a worthless press release. I hope they don&#39;t consider that their 15 day response and that was just a notice to leave us alone. We have 2 weeks to respond.,2021-10-28T01:33:12Z
$PQEFF ‚ÄúTake no action‚Äù aka stop dumping millions of shares for 20 cents you clown,2021-10-28T01:18:03Z
$PQEFF Bailey could use this buyout as leverage to get a joint venture going or find a new buyout suitor. he could call up his connections in the oil industry and say &quot;hey, so you  know how we&#39;ve had discussions in the past that never fully panned out? well it&#39;s now or never. We can do a joint venture or I will sell the company and it will go private. maybe they&#39;ll work with you but who knows.&quot;,2021-10-28T01:11:09Z
$PQEFF I like the double emphasis on increasing &quot;shareholder value&quot;. makes me more confident in them not fucking us over just to keep control. they&#39;ll find another deal or joint venture, or sign off on the buyout. I like.,2021-10-28T01:06:49Z
$PQEFF no action! That‚Äôs great, so not an outright no as of now. Fucking buying more tomorrow, LFG,2021-10-28T01:05:43Z
$PQEFF Consistent with its fiduciary duties, the Board will evaluate the Offer and Petroteq&#39;s options, including continuing to operate the business to drive shareholder value and potentially exploring possible alternative transaction,2021-10-28T01:01:20Z
$PQEFF There is a silver lining to this attempt at hostile takeover. This had put  Petroteq on notice,and if they fail to perform on an expeditious manner, they (us) will lose big time. They now have all the proven ingredients to make it a success. All they need is to work their A.. off on a war footing. There is no time to waste or to make further excuses for non- performance. TIME FOR ACTION!!!!! Thankfully, current CEO has vast experience and the expertise to make it happen.
This will be the best outcome for us investors who put faith, time and money on this technology.,2021-10-28T00:59:45Z
$PQEFF well, not much to take away from that yet. will have to wait for their update after further reviewing their options.,2021-10-28T00:57:04Z
