$PQEFF SP now will be over 50% return in one month. Guess that not enough for the penny traders!ðŸ¤· Only really small hedge funds would touch these, so it free $ for us retailers.,2022-01-16T20:00:22Z
$PQEFF letâ€™s take the cash offer Iâ€™ll take 74 cents a share.  Been in since 22cents. Iâ€™ll take 336% gain no problem,2022-01-16T19:49:49Z

$PQEFF Why isnâ€™t Viston releasing more information to give shareholders more comfort and encouragement in tendering their shares?

The opaqueness of the financing, the secrecy behind the owners/intentions, the total lack of communication. With the recommendation in place and it being way, way too late for a competing offer, why not give shareholders the peace of mind required to ensure 90% tender?,2022-01-16T18:15:14Z
$PQEFF just noticed PQ didnâ€™t file their crap on time 1/14/22.,2022-01-16T18:03:11Z
$PQEFF 
Excellent dd on Viston. I did the same a few weeks ago and came to the same conclusion. Viston AG is a legitimate shell corporation. 
Sparta301 this is not the first offer for petroteq it is a second and significantly higher offer than the first. Also an independent consultant Haywood has determined it is a fair offer and the board of directors of petroteq agreed. But you think it too low an offerâ€¦really???,2022-01-16T15:10:05Z
$PQEFF Did some digging on Viston and found that they are partnered with &quot;Ecologic Earth Energy&quot; 
If you go on their website, you&#39;ll find our guy Zbigniew Roch there as well. 
Check out the http://earth-energy.eu/references.html page as well and scroll down to patents to see that the head of Ecologic Earth Energy (also Polish by the way) has been patenting things related to hydrocarbons like a mad man since the 1980s. I didn&#39;t find anything specifically for extracting hc from sand but the name &quot;ecologic earth energy&quot; and current projects in motion make it pretty clear that these guys are: 
1) into making fat stacks of cash from innovative ways to extract energy 
2) into the green lifestyle 
 
You can read about Bohdan Zakiewicz from here http://www.earth-energy.eu/management.html 
My man is neck deep into commercial US oil fields, has lead 29 energy &amp; mining projects around the world, nominated for Nobel Prize. I think the offer is legit if Eco Earth Energy is the actual interested party.,2022-01-16T13:32:03Z
$PQEFF take some earnings and put them in $KASHF 
They can probably do the same in 2022..,2022-01-16T07:06:08Z
$PQEFF almost 3 weeks left.. damn this feels like forever.,2022-01-16T07:01:24Z
$PQEFF Someone is trying to grab PQEFF for CHEAP at 59 cents.  Who the fuck ever takes someone&#39;s first offer.  Does ANYONE know how to do business?  Holding until a FAIR price emerges.,2022-01-16T03:42:10Z

$PQEFF never underestimate viston leadership. Itâ€™s not even German or Swiss. Zbigniew roch is a polish selfmade. A shell for sure. But who is behind him? Turkey ? Russia ? Who knows,2022-01-16T01:17:49Z
$PQEFF I am checking in, any news yet?,2022-01-16T00:27:56Z
$PQEFF We&#39;re all just waiting a very long short time til Feb 7th and checking in here to make sure nobody has posting any dreadful change in the meantime,2022-01-16T00:16:20Z
$PQEFF block party!!!,2022-01-15T23:58:17Z
$PQEFF clowns need attention. Hereâ€™s your attention ðŸ¤¡,2022-01-15T22:28:11Z
$PQEFF @eric1960 stop Spamming this page, no one cares,  Move on,2022-01-15T22:18:40Z
$PQEFF,2022-01-15T20:40:18Z
$PQEFF And people here are saying that I&#39;m an idiot and a clown but the price is moving down if everything looks so good the price would be moving up and I don&#39;t attack people on the internet that are posting from behind a keyboard or a cell phone I think it&#39;s just spreading hate, I just try to stay with the facts,2022-01-15T20:29:42Z
$PQEFF I haven&#39;t dealt with too many buyouts with over-the-counter bulletin board, but my general experience is anything under $5 you have to be very very very careful,2022-01-15T20:27:18Z
$PQEFF to me the OTC bulletin board is like a lottery, every once in a while, people make a ton of money on them, but most people lose  most of their money  if they try to invest, but day trading or swing trading  is okay, and if nobody won big once in a while nobody would play the game,2022-01-15T20:20:46Z
$PQEFF I doubt everything in pennyland, even now the price is moving down you would think it&#39;d be moving up,2022-01-15T20:16:53Z
$PQEFF your an idiot!  That is all.
