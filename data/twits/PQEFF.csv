$EEENF Different type of oil play, but solid new tech and possible takeover in progress for big gains. Check out $PQEFF 88 Gang!,2021-11-29T23:39:32Z
$PQEFF Few(er) had time to short here today (~18.1%). WTI and Brent movement that was mixed today may have played a small part in the move lower.,2021-11-29T22:46:56Z

$PQEFF I want back in but not at this priceâ€¦ looking for say .113,2021-11-29T19:15:47Z
$PQEFF I have high confidence that a bidding war is about to erupt and .60 will look like chump change.,2021-11-29T19:08:55Z
$PQEFF The thing that makes me nervous about this stock is if the offer doesn&#39;t go through, it&#39;s obvious and clear as day that they don&#39;t have enough capital for operations and will issue tons of shares and dilute the price. I have high confidence that the deal will go through and that&#39;s why I&#39;m sticking with it.,2021-11-29T18:20:55Z

$PQEFF ,2021-11-29T17:19:03Z
$PQEFF It would appear that Valkor/Petroteq/Tomco are really trying to get some momentum in Utah through more urgent collaboration. Who knows what might happen on the back of these developments but at least they&#39;re not sitting on their hands hoping the Viston baddies will go away....,2021-11-29T16:17:49Z
$PQEFF the more I think on this the more I feel the board is not going to give up something theyâ€™ve worked decades on just to make investors happy, theyâ€™ve diluted this thing to death in the past and now itâ€™s about to get taken right before it becomes profitable. Theyâ€™re going to dilute majorly again to prevent this because itâ€™s their only option. If viston was willing to spend any amount theyâ€™d skip all this and just buy it for whatever petroteq wants, theyâ€™re willing to invest in this project if they can get it for the right price, itâ€™s going to take hundreds of millions more to even begin to put it into practice in the real world. If the board dilutes, and viston decides to move on to some other investment and pull this offer, this thing is going to hell.,2021-11-29T14:53:08Z
$PQEFF,2021-11-29T14:35:16Z
$PQEFF Interesting swap. Not sure it matters. My thought, based on absolutely nothing,  is the company personnel are going to issue themselves a license to operate or participate with Valkor on these properties through a shell and let the buyout go through on the tech and licensing. They still have shown no indication of getting financing or coming up with viable strategy for the company. December is almost here.,2021-11-29T14:25:30Z
$PQEFF growth ðŸ™Œ,2021-11-29T14:16:09Z
$PQEFF Interesting. It&#39;s not poisoning the well (Viston only cares about the patents) so the main take away here for me is that Valcor seems comitted to having these plants built considering both this and from the Tomco deal. While this doesn&#39;t really provide any insight on how the financing structure of a plant would look like, Valcor being tied in certainly makes getting capital a lot easier. I wish Valcor was publically traded.,2021-11-29T14:15:31Z
$PQEFF awesome! Same amount of oil but cheaper extraction costs, looking good,2021-11-29T14:13:26Z
