$PQEFF Wait til everyone finds out that PQEFF is a really cheap crypto but backed up by real value - OIL.  Businesses using crypto/blockchain technology but backed up by real assets ARE THE NEXT cryptos.  Hurry up people.  I will be increasing my position tomorrow.,2021-12-08T03:49:25Z
$PQEFF This company uses blockchain in its bitumen mining operations. They claim that the use of block-chain has led them to environmentally safer and cheaper extraction costs that are equal to 20bbl.  That makes this cheaper to extract than in the middle east. Further, if their claims are validated, they will transform the dirtiest of all oil fields (Canadian Tar Sands).
Blockchain is starting to transform business in a major positive way.,2021-12-08T03:46:24Z
$PQEFF Question if anyone knows who owns Valkor and why do we care that any plant be built uses Valkor as the sole and exclusive provider of engineering, planning, and construction ‎services for all oil sands plants,2021-12-08T03:18:47Z
$PQEFF I&#39;m checking out the company on Stocktwits and I see ideas from time ago - 2Y ago a user posted an idea talking about how the company uses blockchain in its bitumen mining processes...  
 
Seeing that, does that not make you think the guys behind Petroteq are master manipulators and will ride whatever market trend to get a rise out of the stock? Honestly. Blockchain for oil extraction?

$PQEFF Overall volume up a bit since Thanksgiving. Daily short sale volume at ~35.4% today.,2021-12-07T23:12:36Z
$PQEFF who else here thinks Viston is paying people to short or otherwise depress the price. with a (at the time of offer) 3x price who the hell would sell?,2021-12-07T23:00:07Z
$PQEFF Viston is nice enough to take this piece of junk from you for 4x the current price. Do not miss this opportunity. Tell your friends and family to TENDER ASAP,2021-12-07T22:41:12Z

$PQEFF I have tried to do proxy vote but it says my control number is bad but i copied right off the email? not sure what I&#39;m doing wrong,2021-12-07T21:11:43Z
$PQEFF I have to say, listening to all of you doomday naysayers and &quot;tender now or we all die!!!&quot; Shills makes me chuckle something chronic. I came into this investment solely on the tech alone and not the management nor the offer. As to whether or not management are incompetent old fogeys with one foot in the grave, it doesn&#39;t detract from the fact the technology is live and kicking and someone somehwere will pick this golden nugget back up if the offer falls through, or Petroteq will build their plant and we grow organically. Either way I will take the offer if im forced to in late Jan just like everyone else, but I am most certainly not worrying if this offer falls through. If anything, it would actually make me smile with a sadistic grin if it did, just to watch all the naysayer bears scream and cry as the price plummets &quot;Scam!&quot;, &quot;Am broke!&quot; and &quot;Am callin ma lawyerrs!&quot;. All the while I quietly scoop up the shares they sell off on the penny, sit back and wait for what comes next.,2021-12-07T20:00:50Z

$PQEFF this is a great time to buy. You&#39;ll be up 50% next week. Go ahead and @ me,2021-12-07T16:57:38Z
$PQEFF It could be that they brought it down here, so more shares can be easily bought to be tendered... And the buying will take it back up, but only after the majority have tendered?,2021-12-07T16:37:48Z
