$PQEFF there are two ways to look at this. 1. Be upset that it‚Äôs halted on the TSX thanks to the dumb moves of the old CEO - the $6 million debt charge and the dilution at low prices. 2. Be happy that he screwed it all up so you can buy cheap shares. 

The company is in talks with an interested buyer. There are lawyers behind this, reputable securities law firms representing both ends. So this isn‚Äôt some pump and dump scheme. If this was a normal circumstance the SP would be 50 cents at least. 

As for the years of prior bad behaviour or complaints about the company. What do you expect? It was a company in development. You don‚Äôt buy into a stock like that that early. You wait for the process to be marketable THEN buy it. Now is the time to buy.,2021-10-24T21:40:56Z
$PQEFF I would think that Petroteq must know that they need to accompany TSX reinstatement with awesome news. A lot of people have been frozen from buying or selling for a long time and many are probably on the fence on whether to hold, add, or sell because of this prolonged situation. If they can put out an awesome piece of news at the same time as trading resumes for PQE the buying pressure will be enormous,2021-10-24T19:45:46Z
$PQEFF Any Ontario securities lawyers out there? Isn&#39;t s.127 of the Ontario Securities Act the authority for the suspension? 

The spirit of s. 127 is to revoke suspensions in a timely way once compliance is achieved.  The language is &quot;as soon as is practicable&quot; and an initial 15 day suspension is contemplated subject to extension in the event of non-compliance.  What it doesn&#39;t say that the OSC can take its sweet fuckin time.

The company cured the delinquent records issue on Aug 24 from what I can see.  

I think the OSC is offside its statutory mandate at this point.  

Time to unleash the Karens on the OSC.,2021-10-24T19:29:33Z

I love Bailey&#39;s presense as CEO. he is very relaxed and confident and has the resume needed for this transitionary phase to really scale the business, sell licenses, or orchestrate a buyout. I also love how many times he has thanked investors for sticking around through the hard times. He obviously wants to do well by everyone and I truly believe he will. it&#39;s all ‚è´ from here

$PQEFF PQE/PQEFF reminds me so much of Cielo (CMC)
CMC - 600M+ shares outstanding (PQE 600M-)
New patented tech for hydrocarbons (CMC garbage to diesel, PQE new oil sands extraction method)
Both have royalty agreements for other companies to build plants and pay royalties 
CMC on Jan 2021 10 cents SP on low volume (2-7M per day)
Mar 2021 (three months later) $1.62 SP on 50M volume (just under 10% of all shares)
Has since pulled back as tech is not commercially verified yet (PQE‚Äôs tech has been 3rd party FEED verified)
PQE trading at 13 cents USD on 2-7M volume per day has pulled back from June high mostly due to issues with TSX halt (issued shares below TSX min price without prior approval)
IMO we can easily the CMC type of run (from $0.10 to $1.62) with PQE once TSX starts trading again and more people understand what is going on here, the mysterious buyer in talks with the company is just a bonus and should help bring more attention once the uncertainty of the TSX issue is cleared up,2021-10-23T19:14:49Z

$PQEFF very different companies and technologies but this feels a lot like $gevo felt when it was way under a dollar. lots of people excited about the company finally turning a corner and getting things right mixed with skepticism from the past over old dilution, mismanagement, and failed promises. I think we end up with a run even better than GEVOs run was from under a dollar and into the teens as the applications here are just as big as biofuels and the marketcap is still very very low.,2021-10-23T17:21:03Z
