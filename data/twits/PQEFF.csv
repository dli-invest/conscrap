$CEI  Sorry not sorry for the spam:  Want to make up some of your CEI losses? Still not too late to buy $PQEFF for 40 cents and cash out for 58 cent buyout offer at the end of the month, less than two weeks away.  Jump back in beginning of march if you must but buy viking this time which is still worth something if CEI fails.   
 
Tender your PQEFF shares by calling your broker before Feb 23rd.

$PQEFF Assuming that Putin doesn‚Äôt start WWW III and send currency markets into chaos, the 420M EUR credit facility confirmed by RBOS to be at the ready is much more than enough to cover fully diluted shares of about 795M at .74 CAD and closing costs and Viston exec festivities with the classiest of hoes:

Credit facility 

420,000,000 EUR x 1.444 FX = 606,480,000 CAD

Acquisition cost

0.74 x 795,000,000 = 588,300,000 CAD

Remainder for closing costs / Viston festivities with classy hoes

18,180,000 CAD

So get to tendering.,2022-02-16T21:48:21Z
