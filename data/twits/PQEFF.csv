$PQEFF fuck the tsx hard. This is such bs. Everyone on this board, ceo, reddit should be blasting them relentlessly. #freepetroteq,2021-11-10T03:50:36Z

$PQEFF Boy...this new infrastructure bill could sure use some frack sand for all that road construction and repaving...I wonder where they could have an unlimited supply of that and clean up oil sand land and generate needed domestic oil too?  If only we knew of a company and a technology that could do all that...,2021-11-10T01:16:25Z
$PQEFF why????,2021-11-10T00:49:33Z
$PQEFF howâ€™s everybody doing? I think itâ€™s pretty simple at this point. We wait and if Petro doesnâ€™t come up with a full proof plan, then we tender. I know itâ€™s hard to wait, but hopefully it will be worth it for us all.,2021-11-09T22:43:47Z
$PQEFF I was responding to this patronizing, generic bs from the TSXV,2021-11-09T22:34:02Z

$PQEFF shareholder activism time. Everyone who&#39;s in deep here should be writing to the OSC, TSXV and the company.  #freepetroteq,2021-11-09T18:23:41Z

$PQEFF welp. I&#39;ve been holding TSLA since oct 2019. Sold my first share just now. Actually I sold 100 shares. So now I have $100k ready. If this stock even thinks about going down close to my avg of 0.12 guess what ill do,2021-11-09T18:08:44Z
$PQEFF $5 in 2-3 years and $10 in 5 years. I am holding. 
Do your DD and stop bashing each other.,2021-11-09T17:39:08Z
$PQEFF for a change of scenery.  I picked up 200,000 shares of DPLS today at 9. November will be a great month.. can go long on  or roll profits into more PQEFF...,2021-11-09T17:36:41Z
$PQEFF Biggest factor against us is the trade restriction. Viston knows it, so doesn&#39;t Petroteq. The fact that there is a large group of traders that can&#39;t trade the stock is one thing, but none of the insiders, the board, the officers, none of them can buy until that restriction is lifted. It takes barely any volume to keep this down and most of us already have our shares. I tell myself don&#39;t buy anymore, but once a week or so, I buy more. Small amounts.....We need that restriction lifted!!!,2021-11-09T17:31:17Z
$PQEFF bears and objective bulls are buyers. Their crap gets old.,2021-11-09T17:31:01Z
$PQEFF My patience with the TSX is wearing thin and not being rewarded!!! They need to get off their lazy, fat, pen-pushing asses and stop disadvantaging Canadian an UK shareholders by preventing them from trading.,2021-11-09T16:33:46Z
$PQEFF to anyone selling a single share now: don&#39;t let this be one of the moments youblook back on and  cringe wishing you held. It&#39;ll be a bit of a journey, but we will get there eventually. I&#39;m talking deep in dollar land. Another offer is coming. And then another.

This is billion dollar technology. That&#39;s almost $2 per share. That&#39;s what I will settle for in a BO, otherwise slow grind till we get there,2021-11-09T16:33:21Z
$PQEFF patience will be rewarded,2021-11-09T16:15:51Z

$PQEFF Will be interesting to see how the SP fares if/when the TSX lifts the halt. Personally, I think there would initially be a deluge of buying taking the SP to 30c+, when the sellers and warrant holders move in taking it back down to 20-25c.

However, as the weeks and months go by, I expect the SP to start a walk up to nearer the offer price, depending of course, on what happens in the interim...,2021-11-09T15:55:42Z
$PQEFF So much for Petroteqâ€™s response being a potential catalyst. Oh well, back to holding.,2021-11-09T15:51:58Z
