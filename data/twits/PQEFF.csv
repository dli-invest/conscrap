$PQEFF Are we just waiting for the CFIUS regulatory review period to end  before we can claim that all regulatory hurdles are cleared, funding is available in the bank and we just need to tender to meet the 50%+1 requirement?! Looks pretty promising to me! 
 
CFIUS info: 
On January 5, 2022, the Offeror made a voluntary filing with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (‚ÄúCFIUS‚Äù). CFIUS is a group of Cabinet-level officials in the U.S. government who are authorized to review certain transactions involving foreign investment in the United States, in order to determine the effect of such transactions on the national security of the United States. U.S. counsel to the Offeror was advised by CFIUS that January 13, 2022 would be the first day of the assessment period, which would conclude no later than February 11, 2022. During this period, the Offeror may be requested to provide additional information to CFIUS which may result in the extension of the period.,2022-02-11T15:51:43Z
