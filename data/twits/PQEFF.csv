$PQEFF Here is my email back to Kingsdale, let‚Äôs see what they say: Does Kingsdale/Viston expect to press release an update before the end of February when the remaining filing procedures have been completed? Aka when the only real remaining step in the process is determining the final tendered amount of shares? Does Kingsdale/Viston have access to the total number of shares currently held by brokers (such as my shares at RBC) and have at least a good estimate of how close to 50% (or even 90%) you are to the goal? This information (how many shares have indirectly been tendered aka tendered by the holder but not officially by the broker) could be very useful in swaying any on the fence shareholders who are currently spreading doubt about the offer on message boards. They often site the 144M shares tendered even though many people know that doesn‚Äôt include most broker held shares that number is still used to spread doubt. Thanks for your time.,2022-02-03T02:10:43Z
$PQEFF Someone said we had something like 18% tendered so far.  It sounds like that doesn&#39;t include institutions and perhaps a few more individuals will filter in as well.  
 
My question is this:   
 
I&#39;ve heard the Petroteq board holds 15% of the shares.  I&#39;ve also heard they hold 30%. 
 
First, does anyone know the correct percent of the shares they own? 
 
Second, do we know if they are included in the 18% that has already been tendered?,2022-02-03T00:55:55Z

$PQEFF  
 
I tendered my last shares today but my brokerage said the projected close date had slipped to 2-22.  Has anyone else heard this?,2022-02-02T18:40:50Z
$PQEFF someone explain this price action on this little volume‚Ä¶,2022-02-02T18:27:04Z
$PQEFF when is the expected tender date,2022-02-02T18:17:33Z
$PQEFF why should I tender??,2022-02-02T18:10:39Z
$PQEFF 
Finally got through to E*TRADE and tendered! Thanks for the direct number guys!!,2022-02-02T18:02:20Z
$PQEFF Someone who got an e-mail back from Kingsdale, do you want to ask them if they would accelerate the timeline if the paperwork hold-ups are completed earlier?,2022-02-02T17:45:48Z
$PQEFF The truth is, Petroteq never had any intentions of producing any oil from the tar sands.  Their business model was a proof of concept that it could be done cleanly with their technology.  I think they achieved that.  Now, they are going to try to get as much money as they can by selling their technology.  It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if they issued more stock for cash to investors.  I hope this sale goes through as I have 200K shares tendered many of which I paid only .02 cents/share but It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if us shareholders get screwed.  I‚Äôve seen this scenario play out before with a company called Shrink Technologies.  They had a great idea and proved it would work with a solar  technology.  It couldn‚Äôt be put to practical use but the owners got rich and the shareholders got screwed.,2022-02-02T17:39:46Z
$PQEFF so I can invest today and tender for a 80% gain? Sounds too good to be true, what‚Äôs the catch,2022-02-02T17:02:56Z
$PQEFF so is this anything other than a paperwork hold-up? I don‚Äôt see much cause for concern outside the norm.,2022-02-02T16:52:25Z
$PQEFF Deal goes trough 99,9% 
Dont let you scaring like yesterday,2022-02-02T16:42:32Z
$PQEFF what do you guys think if the sale doesn&#39;t go through? SP will probably fall dramatically at first but we&#39;ll be left with a company with great technology little or no debt and a pile of money from  all the shares sold. It may take some time but if the technology is developed they can produce oil in the $20-$30 range .üòÉ,2022-02-02T16:12:06Z
$PQEFF ALL IN...?!,2022-02-02T15:36:32Z
$CEI Better chance of making your money back with a oil company with clean green tech would be $PQEFF right now. Fell to 33 cents because 58 cent buyout is delayed until end of February.  
The buyout offer is in place and working through regulatory approvals. You buy then call your broker to tender for the buyout.,2022-02-02T15:35:53Z
$PQEFF The only thing that I saw of concern, was the increase in shares outstanding... I&#39;m gathering now, from thinks Kingsdale has said, that they were the result of convertible debentures converting from debt to equity.    The fact that condition was waived, tells me that the acquirers are trying hard to close this deal... 

The fact that they submitted the merger details to the SEC for blessing tells me that they intend to utilize the technology in the US as well as develop the resources they are acquiring here... 
The delay in approval was due to the SEC requesting certain figures that were estimated are now available through Petroteq&#39;s audit and be changed to reflect the audited numbers.

So, if they were looking to get out of the deal, there was the door... I note.    They didn&#39;t take it!,2022-02-02T15:26:46Z
$PQEFF All, please stop saying PQE issued a bunch of shares trying to sewer the deal. When Viston first filed their form with the SEC they had accounted for (564,293,279 outstanding shares at the time, 3,000,000 warrants at average $0.0850, 77,304,886 warrants at average $0.0861, and 151,452,347 share equivalent debentures, meaning the entire transaction at this offer price will cost $469.8M USD with fully diluted share count of 796,050,512), in the recent update they mentioned &quot;there were, as of November 30, 2021, a total of 793,577,564 Common Shares on a fully-diluted basis.&quot; so in actuality the fully diluted share count yesterday is lower than they originally budgeted for in October. We need to stop the FUD saying the company is trying to kill this deal, it appears not to be true at all.,2022-02-02T15:25:09Z
$PQEFF Just curious who&#39;s brokers have and have not adjusted their deadlines for tendering

Mine is still listed for tomorrow,2022-02-02T15:19:29Z
$PQEFF The news like the one from yesterday is exactly the reason why SP was not moving beyond .40
It‚Äôs even worse now, having shaken the confidence of shareholders. Just look at the volume.,2022-02-02T15:13:51Z
$PQEFF for anyone that cares, i just personally confirmed all the details that have been posted here about the press release.,2022-02-02T15:11:31Z
$PQEFF Does anyone know if we can reverse our tender ?,2022-02-02T15:02:09Z
$PQEFF just checked my email confirmation from Questrade, says they will submit my shares ‚Äúon expiry day‚Äù is that normal?,2022-02-02T14:44:59Z
