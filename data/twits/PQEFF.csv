$PQEFF this Thanksgiving I am thankful for PQEFF and it&#39;s potential to let me retire early. I&#39;ve reached 3M shares between all my accts now. I&#39;d rather not tender, and I&#39;m hopeful for a better ROI. But either üôèüôèüôèüôè

Also I&#39;m thankful for my petrobros that stuck with it over the summer. We&#39;ve lost a few lately, and some of you newbies are annoying as crap. But nonetheless it&#39;s been fun coming here and chatting with you all,2021-11-24T18:11:42Z
$PQEFF to the guy who is claiming that the stock will drop to 5 cents if the offer falls through, that is a complete lie, keep in mind the shares were trading around 15 cents before the offer was on the table, I know because that‚Äôs when I bought most of my units, so if it‚Äôs going to drop it‚Äôs probably not going below that,2021-11-24T18:10:24Z

$PQEFF Now we moving...,2021-11-24T17:44:08Z
$PQEFF  Once again, MITKInvestor is telling you a part of the story. The stock was worth five cents to ten cents. Then all the testing was done. All the studies were completed. The offer came in, but the offer wasn&#39;t made public by Viston to us until after the FEED study and the CORT testing. Once the tech was proven to be 100% profitable, that&#39;s when Viston came in to try to steal it for pennies. If it was snake oil tech, would Viston put up 480,000,000 dollars, to start, just to buy it?? I&#39;m sure they have more capable people advising them than MITKToolbag. Now he&#39;s trying to tell you that you are lucky to get the offer cuz the tech is &quot;snake oil&quot; anyway. That&#39;s the definition of a tool bag....And I would block him, but I want to see what he&#39;s posting and lying about as we progress. I&#39;m sure none of you are listening to him anyway...,2021-11-24T17:43:13Z
$PQEFF people, when u makeur decision, just remember that this snake oil technology was worth 5 cents before this new buyer emerged and now u can get a 300% premium for it, u wud have to be a fool not to accept,2021-11-24T17:35:31Z
$PQEFF Guys, do what you want. @PQEMillions has been here right along, this other guy, go look at his profile. Apparently he showed up yesterday or the day before.  There is absolutely no reason to tender your shares before the last allowable second, never mind doing it now. It also makes no sense, financially, to tender your shares at any time before you actually have to. Don&#39;t listen to me, ASK YOUR BROKER!  It&#39;s not a five minute transaction, or an hour, it takes time. Time to tender them and time to get them back.  My shares have to be tendered by the 4th of Feb with Fidelity. I asked how long it would take to get them back and he said, &quot;At least as long as it took to tender.&quot; Don&#39;t believe me, ASK YOUR BROKER!! Don&#39;t get caught in a news related pump to .30, .40 or even more, where you can&#39;t do anything cuz your shares are tendered. And if you can&#39;t tell @MITKInvestor is a phony here, you need some serious help...,2021-11-24T17:21:58Z
$PQEFF let‚Äôs all calm down with the buying today ok guys?  Here‚Äôs what I propose. I‚Äôll buy all the shares I need first and then I‚Äôll post here the word GO.  And THEN you guys go and buy deal?,2021-11-24T17:20:04Z
$PQEFF 100% false.  I&#39;ve never claimed Shell was coming in and making an offer, and a review of my post history will prove it.  My position stated clearly: 

1. Do not tender early.  Put pressure on Viston to raise the offer
2. See if Petroteq can pull a rabbit out of its hat
3. If neither happens, tender in late January and get 60 cents a share

@MITKInvestor on the other hand is scaring you into believing Viston will rescind the offer if you do not tender now.  

I&#39;ll leave it to you to decide which poster has your best interest in mind,2021-11-24T17:17:34Z
$PQEFF I encourage everyone on here to go look at MITKInvestor&#39;s comment history before deciding whether or not to listen to him.  Everything is bearish, every company is &quot;snake oil&quot;, he&#39;s politically motivated (I don&#39;t care what your politics are, but they have no business affecting your market decisions).  You don&#39;t have to listen to me or anyone else on here, that&#39;s your business.  But be weary of people who are down on everything and inject political leanings into the discussion (as opposed to thinks like bills that were passed which directly affect the market),2021-11-24T17:06:35Z
