$PQEFF The Haywood valuation itself doesn‚Äôt matter, nor does the recommendation by management. What matters is whether Haywood has been able to find a buyer or not. With the FEED study in hand, the land rights, and examples of royalties agreements (tentative as they are) Haywood *should* be able to find a better deal. The way their deal is structured gives them a massive incentive to find a buyer, far more than just to give an ‚Äúindependent valuation‚Äù. Their strategy should basically be to knock on every single door of potential buyers, give them a pitch on the tech, and tell them to beat .60cents a share. If, by the time the valuation is released, they haven‚Äôt been able to find a buyer then there is a big problem here that we aren‚Äôt privy too, and I‚Äôd immediately call to tender. This tech may not be well know to the general public, however, unless Haywood is completely incompetent, there shouldn‚Äôt be a single O/G firm that doesn‚Äôt absolutely know about this company.,2021-12-21T04:34:56Z
$PQEFF Plenty(ish) of time to wait. First week of January prob be good time after holidays for PQ to put out the recommendation and Haywood report. Don‚Äôt make investors wait too long and make snap decisions.,2021-12-21T02:42:51Z

$PQEFF anyone trying to scare you or rush your decision before management&#39;s recommendations and Haywood valuation and report is a fraud.

Good people would not be expecting you to make investment decisions until you have all the proper information.,2021-12-20T23:06:21Z
$PQEFF and here is a little story to relate to and keep in mind.

Once upon a time, a lady found a Jackson pollock painting at a yard sale that was authenticated. 

She was offered 9m$ for something she paid 5$ for. She held out, refusing, and said she won&#39;t accept less than 50m$ for it.

In truth, Jackson pollock&#39;s might be worth that, but given the situation and her social status, a tough ask.

You know what happened? She died without having ever selling it. She could have taken 9m$, life changing money, but instead let greed control her and died.

Check other information specifically for that part.,2021-12-20T20:56:24Z
$PQEFF I just want to address a thread that is now buried.

Someone came up with the ridiculous scenario ‚Äúwhat if I tender and miss out on a 5$ spike followed by the company settling at 1$‚Äù in a subtle way to scare investors through greed to not tender.

5$ spike in one day? What would cause the share price to spike 9x the tender offer, only to settle at a price 1.66x the tender offer? Honestly. We have a 4x situation right now as the stock trades at a steep discount to its tender, what would cause this?

I will tell you. Nothing. What if a fairy flies to your house and offers you a 100 ft yacht in exchange for your petroteq shares? It&#39;d be great but also not fucking possible.

These ludicrous posts are dangerous and prey on the greed of investors in this subreddit. 4x in MONTHS is phenomenal. 

The only thing you should be concerned about, and it&#39;s a very real possibility, is us even reaching 50%. If everyone holds out in hopes that everyone else tenders, guess what, no one tenders.,2021-12-20T20:54:32Z

$PQEFF Does anyone think that Viston might be purchasing Petroteq to destroy the technology? I believe I have read some EPA  paperwork that was saying that Petroteq was going to be demolishing its production facility. The only reason I can think of doing something like that would be if a potential buyer was encouraging you to do that. Because if Viston was thinking about utilizing this technology, wouldn&#39;t they make some public statements of how they&#39;re going to change the world with the tech?,2021-12-20T18:38:11Z

$PQEFF interesting scenario question. Full disclosure I‚Äôm not planning to tender unless two things become true, it gets to be mid January without any PRs from management (highly unlikely) or they recommend tendering.

So question is, what happens in this scenario: a retail investor tenders all shares now (some already have), then the price sky rockets on some massive PR to $5+ for only a day then falls back to $1+ which becomes the support floor for the next 4 months. Meanwhile Viston works on revising their original offer but obviously can‚Äôt in 24hrs, but a few weeks after the price rally. So, for those that tender, I would imagine it would take some time though possible to release the shares prior to Feb 7 ti enable them to be available for trading in the open market.,2021-12-20T14:04:18Z
