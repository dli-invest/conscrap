Today it‚Äôs up 23% to $1.53
Just saying,2021-12-16T04:19:08Z
$PQEFF if management doesn‚Äôt step up and make something happen and if takeover doesn‚Äôt go through, ambulance chasers will be lining up, and lawsuits galore. $,2021-12-16T03:15:07Z

$PQEFF Daily short sale volume past three days has been a mixed bag. The late-day selloff was admittedly disappointing today; we were at ~29.2% for the day. Thought about waiting to buy until later in the day, but was too impatient. All well. I&#39;ll buy again next week.,2021-12-16T00:37:37Z
$PQEFF anyone see @VeteranBroker just wanted to do a wellness check... he spammed our board hard yesterday... all. day. long.  but today he is no where to be found...,2021-12-15T23:53:49Z

$PQEFF Means absolutely nothing but TD is showing $1000.16 on the Ask lol,2021-12-15T23:16:38Z
$PQEFF Cannot sell, cannot buy, any price action in what case whatever ..... I&#39;m not interested üòÑ,2021-12-15T21:41:19Z
$PQEFF He&#39;s the biggest bag of tools on the internet.....There&#39;s no pump, there&#39;s just buying and selling with no price in mind. There&#39;s no news, no valuation yet, so all this is crap. Everybody chill and we have to wait for the valuation or other news!,2021-12-15T21:14:33Z
$PQEFF Looks like the pump is over. OUCH!,2021-12-15T20:51:46Z
$PQEFF There we go again! Manipulation!!!!,2021-12-15T20:50:36Z
$PQEFF Ran a small experiment. Put a few shares to sell at 0.1475. I was immediately matched on the level II with a corresponding sell order. I bumped it down to 0.1474, immediately matched again. Bumped it to 0.1473, the other order immediately matched mine again.

Didn&#39;t end up selling any, but shows that most of the trading going on here is probably just algorithms,2021-12-15T19:16:17Z
$PQEFF  Isn&#39;t a Bullish signal if the Ask Size is significantly higher than the Bid Size? Shouldn&#39;t the SP be on a rocket in that case?,2021-12-15T18:37:19Z
$PQEFF  .still intit to wintit,2021-12-15T18:31:32Z
$PQEFF Doubled?  This trade better be a 10x at a minimum.  MINIMUM 10x.,2021-12-15T18:03:54Z
$PQEFF When the morning comes when you wake up and your portfolio has doubled, you will remember that you bought Petroteq shares.,2021-12-15T17:55:00Z
$PQEFF Almost feels
like a trading halt.,2021-12-15T17:40:39Z
$PQEFF If the SP continues to rise this week, it might be a sign of the Haywood report having been given to Petroteq?? The BoD may now be formalizing their report to shareholders.,2021-12-15T16:27:05Z
