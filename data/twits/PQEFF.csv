$PQEFF I&#39;m thinking $8 a share on the low end, $80+ on the higher end.  This market is worth over a trillion dollars.,2021-11-12T22:58:19Z

$PQEFF In the new video released, check out minute marker 2:58 &quot;..back into the Earth&quot;. This is CCS carbon capture and storage. Seriously gaining major traction with Big Oil. You can do a quick google search and understand why. Billions of dollars pouring into this new realm of ESG this past month. Exxon recently created an entire division based on CCS. This, I believe, will be the primary selling point for many buyers/offerers. Negative carbon credits are obtained through CCS, subsidies from governments are received from credits, taxes, etc. Economically, the fact Petroteq can extract i.e. separate the hydrocarbons aligns 100% with Big oil immediate investments. Place a death grip on your shares if you own $PQEFF.,2021-11-12T20:37:39Z

Check the sec.gov for Fails-to-Deliver Data, which is a very good indicator for naked-short and you will see (naked)-short is going on for a long time on this!!!

1. Looks for me like mm and institutionales are trying to scare off retail investors in order to collect stocks cheaply.
2. Day traders and (naked)short-traders are playing their game.

We just need to buy and holdðŸ™ŒðŸ’ŽðŸš€
I still believe if we all would tender our shares (temporarily) we can get more then the .74 CAD/.60USD,2021-11-12T20:09:37Z

 Does anyone have any idea when the Haywood report is going to be released? Not looking for an exact date just looking for a general guess.

I suppose it depends on what PQE have requested and how much they are paying for it. My guess would be 2-4 weeks due to the potential urgency of the situation.,2021-11-12T15:19:37Z
