$PQEFF so is there a mandatory tax withholding requirement for a tender offer in the US? Never done a tender before.,2022-02-11T00:52:54Z
$PQEFF The truth is... today&#39;s SEC filing was just to announce the Press Release of today!  Today&#39;s PR showed this deal is about to happen.  Get those shares tendered folks and let&#39;s get er done,2022-02-11T00:41:14Z

$PQEFF picked up another 30,000Shares to tender ‚úÖ,2022-02-10T16:41:55Z
$PQEFF My Biggest question. Who is selling all these shares? 
Otherwise seems like a no brainer.  
How are there still shares available for 38 cents? Who is selling and why?,2022-02-10T16:04:43Z
$PQEFF ok i got some shares. #tendering,2022-02-10T15:56:30Z
$PQEFF Someone wrote earlier that Viston are very keen. You bet your bollocks they are keen...They will make fortunes for whoever it is they are fronting. Their money is locked in, but..what we need is another interested party to come in and make a more realistic bid. Who knows? I have tendered and freely admit i will make a nice few quid, but there is still time for another party to come in late.,2022-02-10T15:43:18Z
$PQEFF so when do we close now that funds are available,2022-02-10T15:42:58Z
$PQEFF  
Very good news... 
 
Only missing fact before the Champaign gets served is still some update from Viston about the hight of tendered Shares... 
 
 
But right now I am 99% bullish about our little green oil baby ... 
 
And once again to all those high-risk hell-riders out there who haven&#39;t tendered yet - There will be NO better Deal! 
 
Tender, Tender, Tender...,2022-02-10T15:33:38Z
$POAI alright you should see a nice bounce back. I&#39;m completely out of $POAI for the next 3 weeks. Sold after this last drop and am gambling it all on $PQEFF. GLTA,2022-02-10T15:33:09Z

$PQEFF BTW if and when Viston do a PR that they got 50+1 shares, there is a period of mandatory 10 days for all the ones who haven&#39;t tendered ‚¨ÖÔ∏è e.g; me,2022-02-10T15:17:44Z
$PQEFF so‚Ä¶hard‚Ä¶not‚Ä¶to‚Ä¶keep‚Ä¶BUYING! Resisting so far today. üòä,2022-02-10T15:15:48Z
$PQEFF  Quick question. I currently hold and have tendered my shares of PQEFF. However, PQE (@ .195 CAD) is trading on the TSX. Why is there such a discrepancy in share price. Will PQE also be given .74 CAD for the tender offer?,2022-02-10T15:02:50Z
$PQEFF I know it&#39;s been stated multiple times, but could someone remind me of the final Viston buy out price. Is it $0.74? I just want to make sure I&#39;ve got it right. Thank you in advance. I know I&#39;m an idiot.,2022-02-10T15:02:35Z
$PQEFF Trying to decide on either a Lambo or 911,2022-02-10T14:56:24Z
