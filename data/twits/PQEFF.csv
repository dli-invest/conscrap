$PQEFF $PQEFF  There is a curious sentence in the Petroteq Directors Circular: ‚ÄúIt is Petroteq‚Äôs current intention not to disclose developments with respect to its Strategic Reciew process until the Petroteq Board has approved a specific transaction or otherwise determines that disclosure is necessary or appropriate.‚Äù 
Surely Haywood has finished the review by now, but also remember that part of the deal with Petroteq is that they will be paid ‚Äúa substantial portion of fees that is contingent upon the completion of any successful transaction.‚Äù    
Haywood wants to be paid, so they are either already in talks for potential deals or they are actively looking to find one.,2022-01-02T01:01:34Z

$PQEFF If someone had given you PQEFF as a lotto at .015 cents before the buy out would you have taken it? Really ask yourself and be honest. 

GXXM is my next OTC lotto. $10 million market cap so buying it today is the equivalent of being able to purchase PQEFF for .015. Is it a high risk play? Yes.... But then again so was PQEFF before the buy out. Sometimes you have to go with your gut and hold on tight.

GXXM nearest competitor on the OTC is $AABB who hit a $700 million market cap BEFORE the exchange went live. GXXM already has a functional exchange, is generating revenue per last week&#39;s news release with MMMM, and is going to launch CryptoBooks via Battlefin on the AWS network in 2022 in time for tax season. $10 million market cap. 

Risk it for the biscuit. Without this line of thinking I wouldn&#39;t have picked $DPLS up at .008 and I wouldn&#39;t have picked up PQEFF at .045. Happy new year to everyone, happy hunting this year. There is gold in them hills üíµüíµüíµ,2022-01-01T15:50:28Z
$AUNXF Let&#39;s start the New Year on this board with data and facts to help current/new investors better understand the Company, its trailing financial performance and growth opportunities. See the following posts from me, and feel free to ask questions. I will repeat them over the next few weeks in advance of the Jan-28 general meeting.
-----------------------
Trailing financials have been strong sequentially (QoQ) and YoY, accelerating revenue at improving margins through vertical integration (drilling, storage, transportation), positive operating cash flow driving new/additional acquisitions. This is all being accomplished with a new/incremental revenue stream (in situ natural gas powered crypto mining - Elite partnership) coming on-board. This will monetize an otherwise trapped asset and drive additional revenue at strong margins, as there will be no need to transport or store the natural gas used on-site.

$AUNXF is a different/unique investment from $PQEFF, $VBHI, $RECAF and EEENF.,2022-01-01T13:28:37Z
