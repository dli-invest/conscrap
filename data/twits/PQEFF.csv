$PQEFF dang that dip Gonna net some folks quick almost 100% today in just couple weeks. Wonder if I call Viston if they would tell me buy more or give me any clue, just to reassure the deal. I’ll make a few calls . 😉,2022-01-25T03:04:53Z
$PQEFF if you are holding out still, why are you?

Are you waiting till the 4th? Or do you want the deal to fail so the company can expand their tech,2022-01-25T02:28:49Z
$PQEFF 2 weeks till we find out the truth. Tender those shares,2022-01-25T02:22:25Z

Is anyone else having issues getting thru to E*TRADE!!! I’ve held on for an hour then get a message it could be another hour!! Terrible customer service!! I just want to tender!!! 🤬🤬,2022-01-25T02:04:59Z
$PQEFF everyone is pointing out that the stock dropped today but it did so on only 8 million shares traded that’s extremely low volume considering the market volatility today and also the price of this stock. If you haven’t tendered your shares tender them now, stop day trading and go for the for sure thing,2022-01-24T23:14:11Z
$PQEFF tendered 👍,2022-01-24T22:53:12Z

$PQEFF tendered today...,2022-01-24T21:36:23Z
$PQEFF I keep seeing ask lots of 2,500, so like $800 - $1,000, small potatoes. Could that be someone trying to keep price down? If so, why would they be doing that?,2022-01-24T20:38:53Z
$PQEFF Bought more and tendered.,2022-01-24T19:56:39Z
$PQEFF YAAAWN, is this all the over leveraged paperhands and MM’s have to show?  It will take a lot more than that to wake me from my cozy tendered slumber…,2022-01-24T19:13:54Z
$PQEFF I&#39;m buying the dip, assuming selling pressure from the markets diving. That said, Sure hope the bad market won&#39;t affect the buyers financial position to close the deal,2022-01-24T18:27:51Z
$PQEFF Sure do appreciate the cheap shares .. can we  for .30 cuz why not? Scoop up for tendering. 💵,2022-01-24T18:27:23Z
$PQEFF  another short raid. seems like it’s worthwhile to place a .30-.32 bid to catch the next one!,2022-01-24T18:09:35Z
$PQEFF Bought a few more to tender😁,2022-01-24T17:45:37Z
$PQEFF Bought $15k more on the dip, 67% gain if the tender goes through, seems too easy,2022-01-24T17:45:18Z
$PQEFF 

Most of the sales are coming from the same mm’s who have been playing their silly game for weeks.

Real Investors are not selling! Why would they 😉,2022-01-24T17:45:06Z
$PQEFF 

Anyone watching the trading live on level 2 and with a little bit of experience can see that this was a short attack.  The third in the last 3 weeks. 

Now the paid bashers will attack me again 😂 

You can do whatever you want, the investors don&#39;t sell,2022-01-24T17:42:24Z
