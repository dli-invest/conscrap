$PQEFF btw.. GO HAWKS!,2021-12-04T21:53:45Z
$PQEFF Back in the Spring Zacks put a 72c value on the stock ‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt seem likely that Haywood would come in lower given the completed FEED report and license sale.,2021-12-04T21:32:12Z
$PQEFF I wonder if they got the Haywood evaluation and due to them factoring in the missmanagement it was too low to publish it.,2021-12-04T18:07:01Z
$PQEFF Every shareholder should be itching to see the Haywood valuation. If you want everyone to tender their shares then the Haywood report will help, example if Haywood puts a value of say $1CAD many shareholders will look at it and say ‚Äúok, Viston‚Äôs offer makes sense, the company is worth $1 and they are offering $0.74 all cash, I will tender my shares and wait for the buyout in February‚Äù, if you believe in the tech and the future of the company you will see the $1 valuation and be excited for the potential alternative transactions the company and Haywood can potentially bring forward, but you are also confident in the value of the Viston offer so if anything better doesn‚Äôt come along by middle of January you are prepared to tender. Both groups should be wary of the FUD noise and decide what is best for themselves.,2021-12-04T14:55:34Z
$PQEFF my opinion of what will/has happened. The COO accepted the TO and will receive $0.59 per share in exchange once the deal goes through. However, the share price will likely sky rocket past $0.59 to $1+ before returning to settle around the offer price. The catalyst for that movement will be in the PRs in the next few weeks to come. Some uncertainty will exist in the PR that the market will imply as bullish, uncertainty if the Viston price is enough or potentially an agreement has been reached after Viston agreed to increase their price or another offer from separate company is announced. The bidding war that has been hypothesized would at that point officially commence. This will be sold prior to February, without a doubt, the question remains to whom and for how much?,2021-12-04T14:48:14Z
$PQEFF George is listed as semi-retired now open to new opportunities. His year and a half role is complete, it was to get a deal done. He‚Äôs listed his sole proprietorship LLC as his current employment, focused on getting technical aspects/assets of a company documented to prepare for deal making. Saying we were bought out without saying we were bought out. Without a doubt major change a petroteq coming in next few weeks, most likely before EOY for taxation purposes,2021-12-04T14:38:20Z
$PQEFF I see a lot of people worried about SP atm. The whole market was red this week, not just this one.  This one actually held up pretty good considering the week the market just had. Next week will most likely be even bloodier.,2021-12-04T04:24:02Z
$PQEFF Here is my opinion:It‚Äôs always darkest before the dawn. Try to ignore the noise and negativity until mid January. If someone was trying to bring the price down and create fear and panic selling they are succeeding right now, we know the Haywood report is coming and we know that the board recommendation is coming after that (which may be the board saying to accept the offer). Tendering now does not help anything but if you feel you want to tender then by all means go ahead but it will not prevent Viston from pulling the offer if that is what they want to do, they could have 90% of shares tendered in January and still pull the offer, people are grasping at ways to gain control of a situation that is beyond our control and if tendering prevents you from selling your shares at under 20 cents then tendering is way better than not tendering in my opinion, but if you can wait it out until after the Haywood report at least you will have more information to make your decision.,2021-12-04T03:48:11Z
$PQEFF What morons are selling?,2021-12-04T03:18:59Z
$PQEFF @draincleaner 
Looks like you win the SP pool 0.135 maybe next
Sucks for me buying this week at. 16 and. 15
Added here and $AUNXF this week,2021-12-04T03:16:25Z
$PQEFF reading the news on the new licensee. So pqeff is essentially giving away it&#39;s technology to Big Sky Resources  for $2 million or for free, and 5% royalty. What is wrong with this management? What is this crap? Freaking terrible. There was a very good buyout offer on the table and it will go away now, no wonder my long went from +130% to flat. I&#39;ll be dumping my bag of shares on Monday, good luck everyone,2021-12-04T01:39:18Z
$PQEFF Daily short sale volume at around 40% yesterday, 29.3% today. A bit of a volume increase on the price drops. Buying again on Wednesday next week. Have a great weekend, all!,2021-12-03T23:22:49Z
$PQEFF there&#39;s just too many shares floating to stop the sale.  Valkor is a big owner along with bellridge but they alone cannot stop the takeover.,2021-12-03T22:51:03Z
$PQEFF It seems people are still uncertain whether the offer will go through which is fair I suppose. I for one hold a certain amount of uncertainty as well. However as the days go on I am more convinced that the deal will go through unless there is some huge change that occurs between now and February.,2021-12-03T21:52:54Z
$PQEFF Here&#39;s an easy test to see if you&#39;re aware of what&#39;s going on: do you think Viston is excited or nervous about this huge dip?,2021-12-03T21:12:29Z
$PQEFF sure seems like all the big share count holders on here have already tendered‚Ä¶.,2021-12-03T20:59:51Z
$PQEFF what are the odds of the tender going thru? Seems like an easy 4x if it&#39;s going to tender,2021-12-03T20:49:35Z
$PQEFF who here still buying while planning on tendering in January? üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,2021-12-03T20:47:25Z
$PQEFF Something a lot of people on here don&#39;t understand: Viston doesn&#39;t want the stock.  They&#39;re not concerned about the SP, or flipping the shares for more, etc.  They want the technology.  Period.,2021-12-03T20:34:58Z
$PQEFF I&#39;m gonna die of laughter when all these guys with small share counts crying out to be greedy and hold out for more lose all liquidity when the deal goes thru and the company becomes private.,2021-12-03T20:04:22Z
$PQEFF To tender or not to tender, that is the question!,2021-12-03T19:49:14Z
$PQEFF if you are worried about people not tendering buy more shares so you can tender them yourself.,2021-12-03T19:42:51Z
$PQEFF I understand folks argument to hold out on tendering in hopes Viston will up their offer and the whole ‚Äúnobody leads with their best offer‚Äù stance, but that only works if investors have a reason not to tender. The current price action isn‚Äôt conducive to that at all, and I seriously doubt Viston feels any pressure at all to raise their offer. I‚Äôll hold for another week or two waiting for the Haywood, but I have extremely little faith that some major catalyst is coming that will surpass the Viston offer. Anyone else considering tendering soon so Viston know not all of retail is delusional? You can always withdraw if the Haywood report is a banger.,2021-12-03T19:30:26Z
$PQEFF at this rate the stock will be at the price prior to the offer,2021-12-03T19:21:53Z

$PQEFF have a good weekend,2021-12-03T17:08:41Z
$PQEFF bought more... Just shy of 200k ... Happy Friday all,2021-12-03T16:15:00Z
$PQEFF watching everyone disagree while I wait for January like:,2021-12-03T15:59:08Z
$PQEFF Stop caring. That‚Äôs literally all you have to do. Just imagine this pepe everytime bears spread fear, uncertainty, doubt etc.  One way or another Petroteq is going up, buy, hold and wait my friends‚Ä¶,2021-12-03T15:35:53Z
$PQEFF eliminate the noise, only positive vibes here. Cheers,2021-12-03T15:14:23Z
