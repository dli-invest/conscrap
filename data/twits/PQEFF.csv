$PQEFF I know many people have asked this here, but I haven&#39;t seen an answer, of what happens if I decide not to tender and they get 90% of the people to tender or if they get 51%,2022-01-18T04:24:08Z
$PQEFF Hey guys, curious about this one. Can‚Äôt locate it in my trading account with TD üá®üá¶

$PQEFF I was looking at this website Quzga posted about Uniexpress and found this thing about Shell in the latest ‚ÄúStatement of capital following an allotment of shares‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt understand what it means, are they doing some kind of business with Shell? sharing it here in case it‚Äôs relevant.      https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/11104166/filing-history?page=1,2022-01-18T00:23:40Z

$PQEFF Is this not trading today, or am I missing something?,2022-01-17T16:36:15Z
$PQEFF TENDER NOW,2022-01-17T15:45:51Z
$PQEFF tender please.  I called RBC and did my part.  Easy money.  If we all don‚Äôt tender we all become huge bag holders,2022-01-17T14:43:20Z
$PQEFF there is literally no other stock out there that can guarantee a almost 100 percent return from the SP today in less than 1 month. #makeitmakesense,2022-01-17T14:33:55Z
$PQEFF My Stockbroker (HL in UK) have said tender instructions required by noon on 1st Feb.  They will process all shares tendered after the deadline. So, it makes no difference if I tender now or in the morning of 1st Feb...,2022-01-17T14:24:18Z

‚ÄûAs long as the exchange rate is set so that the value of the acquirer&#39;s shares exceeds the market value of the target company&#39;s shares prior to the merger, the non-tendering shareholders will receive a fair value for their shares and have no legal claims.‚Äú

Sounds linke Game Over.. No More reasons to wait and not to tender IMO

Better look forward to the payout in February..,2022-01-17T11:01:24Z
$PQEFF so bod will tender and recommend to do that without having Viston proof of funds?  
 
Kingsdale  (#1 Proxy Solicitor company side in Bloomberg&#39;s H1 2021 Global Activism Market Review) calls everyone in order to remind shareholders to tender just for Viston to pull of the deal after all of this?,2022-01-17T09:13:50Z

$PQEFF SP now will be over 50% return in one month. Guess that not enough for the penny traders!ü§∑ Only really small hedge funds would touch these, so it free $ for us retailers.,2022-01-16T20:00:22Z
$PQEFF let‚Äôs take the cash offer I‚Äôll take 74 cents a share.  Been in since 22cents. I‚Äôll take 336% gain no problem,2022-01-16T19:49:49Z
$PQEFF,2022-01-16T19:38:01Z
$PQEFF Why isn‚Äôt Viston releasing more information to give shareholders more comfort and encouragement in tendering their shares?

The opaqueness of the financing, the secrecy behind the owners/intentions, the total lack of communication. With the recommendation in place and it being way, way too late for a competing offer, why not give shareholders the peace of mind required to ensure 90% tender?,2022-01-16T18:15:14Z
$PQEFF just noticed PQ didn‚Äôt file their crap on time 1/14/22.,2022-01-16T18:03:11Z
$PQEFF 
Excellent dd on Viston. I did the same a few weeks ago and came to the same conclusion. Viston AG is a legitimate shell corporation. 
Sparta301 this is not the first offer for petroteq it is a second and significantly higher offer than the first. Also an independent consultant Haywood has determined it is a fair offer and the board of directors of petroteq agreed. But you think it too low an offer‚Ä¶really???,2022-01-16T15:10:05Z
$PQEFF Did some digging on Viston and found that they are partnered with &quot;Ecologic Earth Energy&quot; 
If you go on their website, you&#39;ll find our guy Zbigniew Roch there as well. 
Check out the http://earth-energy.eu/references.html page as well and scroll down to patents to see that the head of Ecologic Earth Energy (also Polish by the way) has been patenting things related to hydrocarbons like a mad man since the 1980s. I didn&#39;t find anything specifically for extracting hc from sand but the name &quot;ecologic earth energy&quot; and current projects in motion make it pretty clear that these guys are: 
1) into making fat stacks of cash from innovative ways to extract energy 
2) into the green lifestyle 
 
You can read about Bohdan Zakiewicz from here http://www.earth-energy.eu/management.html 
My man is neck deep into commercial US oil fields, has lead 29 energy &amp; mining projects around the world, nominated for Nobel Prize. I think the offer is legit if Eco Earth Energy is the actual interested party.,2022-01-16T13:32:03Z
$PQEFF take some earnings and put them in $KASHF 
They can probably do the same in 2022..,2022-01-16T07:06:08Z
$PQEFF almost 3 weeks left.. damn this feels like forever.,2022-01-16T07:01:24Z
$PQEFF Someone is trying to grab PQEFF for CHEAP at 59 cents.  Who the fuck ever takes someone&#39;s first offer.  Does ANYONE know how to do business?  Holding until a FAIR price emerges.,2022-01-16T03:42:10Z
