$PQEFF Theres a few more % coming . . . i can smell it,2022-01-11T03:10:33Z
$PQEFF This was trading between $25 and $30 a share several years ago,2022-01-11T02:52:11Z
$PQEFF so board owns over 24% of shares outstanding.  They unanimously agreed Vistons offer is the best option.  Viston only needs 50% + 1 share for offer to go through.  Viston still seems to be willing to go through with the offer.  1.45X your money based on closing price today.  The faster we tender the faster it can go through as well because they have the option to accelerate the deal if they hit the 50% + 1 mark.  This might be the easiest money I&#39;ve ever made.,2022-01-11T01:47:17Z
$PQEFF ‘‘twas a good day,2022-01-11T01:47:02Z
$PQEFF All in like Errol Flynn.  This board is really solid and the cards have been dealt. I overthought it.  The margins are too slim to be priced out by running it. T-day. Godspeed!!!!!,2022-01-11T01:46:43Z

Great looking chart today! 

Early days, could the share price exceed Viston’s offer?

We have until February to find out.,2022-01-10T21:31:15Z
$PQEFF 

Anything over Viston’s offer is a sell, especially if the share price exceeds how much Viston is paying if you live in Canada vs U.S. $0.59 offer.,2022-01-10T21:26:45Z
$PQEFF nice rise, still 25% to go to offer. 25% if you can wait 4-5 weeks. Buy and tender, easy as that.,2022-01-10T21:17:42Z
