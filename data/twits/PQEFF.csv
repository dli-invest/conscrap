$PQEFF 2021 Presentation

https://presentation.petroteq.com/,2021-11-17T05:41:11Z
$PQEFF spoke like a true impatient amateur who knows little about what’s going on.⬇️,2021-11-17T00:24:46Z
$PQEFF following this closely feels increasingly pointless. I don&#39;t trust management at all so either they secure financing and permits for a plant, so that even a group of idiots couldn&#39;t fail getting it built - though even that is no guarantee it will actually run, see our still idle test plant - or it&#39;s tender time in 10 weeks. The only other alternative would be price action approaching the offer but others apparently share my view of management so fat chance.,2021-11-16T23:46:38Z
$PQEFF Just got my 14D-9 in the mail today here in the US.  Never dawned on me that my million shares is almost 22% of the total directors and senior officers actual common shares of Petroteq that hold 4,590,313 according to docs (of course they have more options of 7.3MM).  Really weird that I own more actual common shares than the CEO...Yikes...

Valkor Energy is the big internal dog with 60.6Million common.  Going to be an interested Dog fight.

Let&#39;s see what Haywood brings to the table...,2021-11-16T23:28:21Z
$PQEFF Shorts backed of a little today (but only a little). About 37.3% daily short sale volume.,2021-11-16T22:55:24Z
$PQEFF Positive vibes, stay long. We&#39;re good. Cheers,2021-11-16T22:22:20Z
$PQEFF did we die?,2021-11-16T20:21:00Z
$PQEFF Looks like we haven&#39;t had volume this low since last year.  Amazing.,2021-11-16T20:16:08Z
$PQEFF when was the last time we had volume this low,2021-11-16T20:02:37Z
$PQEFF 
Most important thing: TSX TRADING!! 

would love to get any info about that.. no more words since last video from Bailey month ago..,2021-11-16T19:55:23Z
$PQEFF An open letter to retail investors selling PQEFF stock as we await a hostile takeover for a massive premium. 

Dear investor, 

You&#39;re an idiot.,2021-11-16T19:44:55Z
$PQEFF I thought someone posted a potential strategy to prevent takeover involving having the stock halted a target company but couldn’t find it again. Is PQ keeping this from being traded on TSX as part of strategy? 
And for those trading in TSX, are u allowed to sell but just not buy, or is all form of trading halted? And does this preclude u from tendering if u wanted?,2021-11-16T19:44:26Z
$PQEFF when can we expect this jump in price?,2021-11-16T18:59:13Z

$PQEFF this is clearly worth 8 usd (3.5b), but trades lower than 0.18 atm,2021-11-16T16:21:41Z
$PQEFF even more bitching part 2:,2021-11-16T16:11:51Z

$PQEFF Prediction: the Haywood valuation comes in with glowing results, which Petroteq leverages to get Viston&#39;s offer up.  They raised it to .80-$1.00 USD, and get their 50+1

While the potential for bigger gains is there, this scenario is life changing for many of us and I welcome it,2021-11-16T14:34:37Z
$PQEFF don’t confuse being unknown with being not valuable, just like PQE is running very under the radar (we have not had a single trading day where 10% of the outstanding shares have traded in a single day since the announcement) TomCo is even more unknown so it was not very likely they were going to get a different financing option from another company, however when they go to finance the full plant it will be after the Haywood report on PQE, then this will no longer be unknown and by extension neither will TomCo,2021-11-16T13:44:31Z
$PQEFF,2021-11-16T13:28:47Z
$PQEFF the tomco announcement was another nothing burger. They spent 500 grand woop dee doo. Now they can sell some more stock to continue to kick the can. The issue with this stock and its related parties are that they talk a big game but have no money or actions to back it up. Viston is the only one at the moment wearing their big girl pants willing to put up 100&#39;s of millions of dollars. I hope the company doesn&#39;t announce another 2 million dollar licensing deal and call it a victory.,2021-11-16T13:23:00Z

$PQEFF ready for Take off,2021-11-16T12:40:10Z
$PQEFF  what is the down side of buying more shares at this point ? Personally I am not sure there is a downside with Viston offer , but may be there is something I am missing , would like to hear opinions on this,2021-11-16T11:45:43Z
$PQEFF I think a lot of investors considering getting involved in the Utah oil sands story will be very confused by the various players and related dealings involved. I believe I am following developments closely but still find myself somewhat baffled by the changing agreements and associations involved. 

We have Petroteq (technology &amp; leases with Viston in the background), Tomco (leases), Valkor (engineering expertise), TSH (leases for sale), Greenfield, (Tomco subsidiary, previously JV with Valkor) and HD Ltd (leases sold to Valkor and Mining technology).

I&#39;m sure I will have missed some of the players involved and may have misunderstood some of the agreements, so what chance has a potential new investor got of fully understanding what is going on prior to committing their capital??????,2021-11-16T10:57:40Z
$PQEFF no enthusiasm for the tomco stock it seems. That they already had to go to Valcor for this and the interest rate probably doesn&#39;t instill confidence they get the plant funding.,2021-11-16T10:26:54Z
$PQEFF better than them forfeiting the downpayment but those are not exactly cheap terms (for the loan, the lease is nice). Not much insight into financability of a plant here, all we know  is that Valcor was willing to step in for a small loan when apparently no one else would,2021-11-16T08:41:45Z
