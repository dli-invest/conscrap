Truly a WIN-WIN situation. 
Have a great weekend!

Next week will be interesting.,2021-10-29T23:08:12Z
$PQEFF hope y&#39;all enjoy your weekend. Don&#39;t forget to email the board and tell them no to poison pills. They are bad, mkay. Let them bring the goods for a better deal and let the owners of the company decide whether to tender or not.,2021-10-29T23:04:48Z
$PQEFF Agree with @dudewheresmybiddingwar .  Look folks, this tech may have the potential to assist with American energy independence.  Who here remembers a few years ago when Oil was humming out of Bakken?  There were all those high paying jobs for hard working Americans, and the price of gas was LOW.  But it was pinching OPEC, so they flooded the market with cheap oil, and oil sands couldn&#39;t compete.  It&#39;s hard to restart those operations.  Now here we are sitting on technology that makes that processing cheap and clean, and we&#39;re sitting around talking about whether or not to sell it to a Swiss company.  Let&#39;s keep this in the USA.  Maybe Petroteq will agree to bring in some heavy hitters.  Or, maybe they partner with an American company like Exxon, Chevron, Devon, Phillips or Occidental.  We have an unthinkable amount of oil sitting right under our feet.  Let&#39;s be energy independent.,2021-10-29T22:59:48Z
$PQEFF üî• There&#39;s a lot ot FUD being spread (for obvious reasons) about &quot;poison pill&quot; dilution. Via debt financing, a JV partner, or institutional placement, this business could expand very quickly.

Let&#39;s consider only the resource PQE sits on. Their conservative target is 10k bpd by 2024. At 19-22k capex per bpd they need about 190m to get there. $75/bbl price and $25/bbl cost = 182m /yr.

Asphalt Ridge has an estimated 1bn+ bbl, and PQE have about 8.5% of that land. If their land choice is merely average, their reserves are 85m bbl. In the unlikely scenario they didn&#39;t acquire further resources, at 10k bpd they&#39;re sitting on 23 yrs of full production. 

And all of this is before you factor in licensing the tech, sale of clean sand, ESG incentives, other remediation applications, recycling asphalt etc.

Do you get it yet? Do you understand why such an aggressive takeover is being attempted so soon after third party validation of the tech? This is a unique win-win situation imo.,2021-10-29T22:42:35Z
$PQEFF Suncor could use this technology in a big way. Exxon could use this technology in a big way (they took their oil sands off their reserves a few months ago because they couldn&#39;t extract it profitably). Almost every major company owns or leases land with oil sands and besides increasing margins, this tech cleans up the environmental impact of oil sand operations. the word about this buyout offer is spreading and there&#39;s no better technology for oil sanda. unless someone Invents a better method, these patents and tech are priceless and are about to be taken away by Viston if nobody acts and offers something better. I expect a bidding war for buyout or a big player to come in for a joint venture. that&#39;s my opinion. the five year chart on this bad boy is about to look like a bathtub. right place. right time. only wusses are selling right now.,2021-10-29T22:40:08Z
