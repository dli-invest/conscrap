$PQEFF But Canadian authorities likely to raise interest rates beginning March, which should strengthen CAD. So if there is a further small delay it may be a silver lining???,2022-02-19T11:46:31Z
$PQEFF  Well the bad news is that since the extension the currency conversion rate has been moving against us from a high of near 59 cents a share back to .5805 at the moment.   
 
Not the worst news but the cost of doing business in this deal,2022-02-18T23:18:20Z

$PQEFF  What a happy synchronicity that we have all this money locked up in an investment with a fixed return at a time the market is choking on it&#39;s own vomit.  
 
I see the market down 1 or 2% one day and then the next....what me worry? Thanks PQEFF sitting on my cash,2022-02-18T16:29:27Z
$PQEFF ok just tender with schwab it took 4 minutes 645000,he claims once deal is complete, 2 to 3 days money is in your account, big question but when is deal  final ?? We don&#39;t have a official date??,2022-02-18T16:21:43Z

$PQEFF I cannot believe that folks are just now tendering their shares smh........,2022-02-18T13:02:33Z
$PQEFF Me when I randomly find a PQEFF boardmate on some other ticker in a few months,2022-02-18T12:56:13Z
$PQEFF 
There&#39;s a likely chance we&#39;ll know the situation of the tender offer next Friday with most brokers deadline being from next Wednesday onwards.
We&#39;ll hopefully get our money a week after that then and onwards and upwards to the next thing üëç
Not long left to go everyone üôè,2022-02-18T10:28:31Z
$CEI  Sorry not sorry for the spam:  Want to make up some of your CEI losses? Still not too late to buy $PQEFF for 40 cents and cash out for 58 cent buyout offer at the end of the month, less than two weeks away.  Jump back in beginning of march if you must but buy viking this time which is still worth something if CEI fails.   
 
Tender your PQEFF shares by calling your broker before Feb 23rd.

$PQEFF final tender count: 3,938,000 shares and I am DONE.  I know what youre thinking,  be a man and go buy 62K more.  I just can‚Äôt do it.   Please tender your shares, I don‚Äôt want to explain to my wife how a bunch of Reddit morons went for broke, didn‚Äôt tender, and we all ended up broke.,2022-02-17T22:39:59Z
