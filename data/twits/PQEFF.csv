$PQEFF Can&#39;t wait to tender.  Ridiculous that unable to trade on TSX.  For those who think management can do better- their lack of communication says it all.  Also, I&#39;m still thinking about the offer sheet wherein the Swiss said PQEFF management is close to incompetent.  While they might have been &quot;offended&quot;, it seems that some grains of truth were in the statement.  Amazing tech.  Big money needed to see if become what it should be,2021-12-27T19:52:41Z

$PQEFF I donâ€™t think this stock is manipulated. People hardly know about the buyout. Very little discussion on social media (including this one). The stock was up 4x from before the announcement.

People most likely wanted profits. This is now going up because of the evaluation and the upcoming Haywood report (buy the rumor), which imo be 100% bullish since they are being paid. 

As it sits this has a possible 3x+ return on any money put in and you only have to wait a month. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s increasing in value. 

We will most likely see a dip as the day gets closer as people take their profit and mitigate their exposure to the deal possibly falling through, leaving their profits to earn the buyout,2021-12-27T17:19:06Z
