$PQEFF after everyone has tendered there shares and this thing decides to go above the .58 ish cent tender price your gonna be very upset I personally feel like somethings in the works here why I’m going to wait to tender my shares specially after finding out that they have the ability to up the offer on the tender shares to $1cad from what I read somewhere but I’ll
Most likely tender in the end if nothing happens but for now I’ll sit back and watch.. it’s still a easy no brained buying this under .50 and tendering is almost guaranteed money lol that’s why I’m surprised to not see more shares bought up every day just buy buy. Buy every day and then tender..,2022-01-14T03:28:06Z
$PQEFF tendered! You should too.,2022-01-14T03:03:13Z

$PQEFF I just got a call from Viston asking me to tender my shares, nice fellow, I tried to ask him if they were close on the percentage but he didn&#39;t know, just a call center type guy lol,2022-01-13T21:37:14Z
$PQEFF i just called my bank(cibc) to tender my share and they told me to call back 10 days before the offer end because they can’t do it for the moment. Anyone else have this issue?,2022-01-13T21:13:54Z
$PQEFF just got a packet from shorecrest today!  it is many pages long but page 6 has the Petroteq Board&#39;s Recommendation to Tender and accept the Viston offer.,2022-01-13T21:09:44Z

To everyone who sends me aggressive messages, take a look at the history, I was here from the start, at that time the price was still below .10, and we were a few hundred.  I was right about everything.  Do not trust anyone who defends the market makers, because they either have no idea or are paid bashers who only pretend to be bullish on you,2022-01-13T19:28:38Z
$PQEFF tendered now All my shares (140k)🍀,2022-01-13T18:25:14Z
$PQEFF Hey, just a reminder to everyone, the board unanimously voted in favor of the Viston offer.  In so many words, they said you&#39;re not going to beat this offer, and this is coming from the people who are admitting they can&#39;t do better.  So no, the former CEO probably won&#39;t be holding his shares, and no, it seems unlikely that they will turn around and try to beat the offer and gain a 90% share.  In my opinion, the only reason Viston doesn&#39;t currently have control is because there are a lot of stockholders who either don&#39;t know or understand what happened with that vote.  It&#39;s online if you want to check.,2022-01-13T18:02:00Z
$PQEFF The former CEO who bought 2M shares right before leaving is definitely holding instead of tendering I bet right?? lolol,2022-01-13T17:54:33Z
$PQEFF Anywhere from .35 - .37 and I&#39;m right back in it.,2022-01-13T17:10:22Z
$PQEFF 

What those mm‘s don’t understand is, no matter how hard they try, we don’t sell! Why would we, we can buy cheap in the market and tender to Buyer and get $ .58

They are sending me aggressive messages 😂

$PQEFF what happens to the shares if you don’t tender them?,2022-01-13T10:58:48Z
$PQEFF Hey, quick question for the Canadians with halted shares.  
I called my broker (TD)  a few weeks ago to tender my shares. I also called TD again last week just to confirm my shares are indeed tendered. I only called bc i have not yet received any kind of written document that says my shares are tendered.  
Finally, my question is, have you received any written document after tendering your shares with TD Canada?  
 
It&#39;s fine but i&#39;d feel better with something written.,2022-01-13T07:29:47Z
