$PQEFF hurry the fuck up already and cash me out 🤣🤣,2022-02-08T00:04:42Z
$PQEFF When the extension came out, Vanguard corporate action page showed my shares as uninstructed even though I instructed them to tender. I tried tendering them a couple times and it never showed as tendered again. Just got a call that they are tendered if you did it the first time you are good to go. Hope this helps if you were wondering and have Vanguard.,2022-02-07T22:30:02Z
$PQEFF IMO the 50% is a certainty and I think tendered shares will be 75% plus. I;m hoping they get the 90% sought and hopefully accelerate the settlement.,2022-02-07T21:53:28Z
$PQEFF Less volume and larger spreads shows more and more shares are being tendered now, leaving less shares in the trading float.  Looking good Petrotech!,2022-02-07T19:16:54Z
$PQEFF and I tendered my shares in less than 4 minutes. You can to.,2022-02-07T18:24:21Z
$PQEFF anyone get word on whether TD extended the deadline to tender? Too lazy to check :P,2022-02-07T18:24:16Z
$PQEFF on the phone now to tender…,2022-02-07T18:18:18Z
$PQEFF hope the CAD starts to strengthen over the coming weeks.,2022-02-07T17:14:02Z
$PQEFF 
70% Profit Potential in less the 3 weeks, almost guaranteed.

Don’t see a better deal out there!

I will buy more 

The mm‘s and their stupid games don&#39;t scare me,2022-02-07T17:09:13Z
$PQEFF there is no glitch on the fidelity app...its been there the entire time,2022-02-07T17:02:47Z
$PQEFF Must be a Fidelity app glitch. If your having issues with your Fidelity order in app you can do it from their site online. 😁,2022-02-07T17:01:41Z
$PQEFF now we have to deal with people on this board who cant even put the ticker letters together correctly...im on fidelity and, yeah its there      They actually went and posted an error picture, when they could have typed anything....clown,2022-02-07T16:44:25Z
$PQEFF 😮,2022-02-07T16:38:05Z
$PQEFF went to buy more on Fidelity just now and it&#39;s saying this ticker doesn&#39;t exist. 🤔,2022-02-07T16:36:23Z
$PQEFF @NewbSponge whats the volume looking like today buddy?,2022-02-07T16:20:54Z
$PQEFF I plan on buying more tomorrow to tender. If we all did the same (with whatever amount we can afford), this will go a lot quicker...,2022-02-07T16:17:24Z
$PQEFF 
I have the feeling that majority of retail/private shareholders already tendered their shares.
The broker/dealers are not forwarding it and waiting.

My opinion is it looks very good, they will get &gt;50%,2022-02-07T15:56:02Z
$PQEFF there must be very low amount of shares not tendered. So Manipulation goes on here,2022-02-07T15:54:02Z
$PQEFF  
Tender please tender. 
Any other speculations will lead to an absolute desaster - for all of us. 
There will be no plan B. 
BOD has left the company, so there is a ship without control on open seas. Ready for the sharks. 
Only a significant number over 50% will bring us profit. 
 
Important job for Viston this week - keeping us informed about the tender quote...,2022-02-07T15:52:26Z
$PQEFF I don’t understand what’s the point of not tendering or waiting to tender. There isn’t going to be a better return later. If the deal falls through the price will drop fast enough that you are still going to lose your money anyway.,2022-02-07T15:40:35Z
$PQEFF for goodness sake .. just tender!
I want this to be over so bad.. 😩,2022-02-07T15:24:45Z
$PQEFF I’ll be tendering my shares tomorrow,2022-02-07T15:20:16Z
$PQEFF another dip?,2022-02-07T15:01:26Z
$PQEFF is this thing frozen? Don’t see anything on level 2,2022-02-07T15:00:37Z
$PQEFF so ready for this to be over….,2022-02-07T15:00:21Z
$PQEFF 🤥🙄🤔,2022-02-07T14:56:57Z
$PQEFF picked up more shares last week and then tendered all my shares. All I can say is if you weren’t buying dips to tender later then idk guess u don’t like money.
I waited to tender my shares until Friday for my own reasons starting to say I’m glad I did after learning a few things I figured this is only way your gonna profit now the management is just so horrible they don’t even care. I’ve held shares with this company since 2018 so it’s about time I get a return. Lol,2022-02-07T13:56:21Z

$PQEFF FYI my 500k shares now (just today) show tendered on E-Trade. Wasn&#39;t like that on Friday.,2022-02-07T13:52:02Z
