$PQEFF never sell @0,6$. Thats a very low price for this golden tech. There WILL be way better offers till february i believe,2021-10-26T04:56:50Z
$PQEFF once a major player gets wind of this buyout offer and the DD that was already done by the bidder, this is going to get wild. you best believe an Exxon or Shell or other oil giant will want this before letting the tech and patents go into someone else&#39;s hands. the news is out for the public to see now and a lot more eyes in the industry will be on Petroteq.,2021-10-26T04:36:35Z

 So some entity creates a webpage to buy out your shares at 5-ish times their value, then tells you how risky the company is if you don&#39;t accept their &#39;offer&#39;. Hard pass, hold for the gold...,2021-10-26T03:48:56Z
$PQEFF i canâ€™t they shit-talked management like that. Sad! my price just got higher!,2021-10-26T03:30:22Z
$PQEFF I&#39;ll repeat this because it&#39;s important, the one thing we know this offer does is, it puts a new ground floor on what this company is worth. these shares are worth AT LEAST 60 cents USD, and that&#39;s being generous to the bidder. they&#39;re worth substantially more.,2021-10-26T03:26:53Z
$PQEFF Once upon a time we had 400 watchers and the SP was 4 cents. Do you know how many people told me this is a scam company ðŸ˜‚.

Big things take time.

$PQEFF lush meadow you do you and weâ€™ll do us which is make a boat load of money.,2021-10-26T02:38:51Z
$PQEFF will anybody sell under .60 tomorrow and what would be your reasoning?,2021-10-26T02:22:53Z
$PQEFF I&#39;ll say it again before bed: if you want to take an buyout, cool.  But don&#39;t take the first offer!  NOBODY OPENS WITH THEIR HIGHEST PRICE,2021-10-26T02:21:22Z
$PQEFF so Iâ€™ll let you guys take the offer and sell since they only want majority shares. If they due partner up and able to expand the company then those who continue to hold will benefit even more in the long runâ€¦ whatâ€™s there to think about? Those who want quick money sell. Those who hold will be rewarded regardless of the majority buy out or notâ€¦,2021-10-26T02:20:55Z
$PQEFF letâ€™s all accept the offer and make money,2021-10-26T02:07:35Z
$PQEFF I donâ€™t see the SP going up to the buyout offer, as the contingencies will lock u up and arenâ€™t guaranteed. Sounds like if they donâ€™t get 51%, then u donâ€™t get the $ and u get keep ur shares. Wish it was u full buyout or offer without strings. Iâ€™ll inquire anyway and be happy to give them shares if I was gonna get paid.,2021-10-26T01:59:39Z
$PQEFF anyone that thinks they&#39;ll just walk away from the table if we don&#39;t take 60 cents is way out of touch with the value of this company and how bad it&#39;s wanted,2021-10-26T01:56:50Z
$PQEFF when you wife finds out you took a ridiculous 60 cent low-ball offer,2021-10-26T01:55:11Z
$PQEFF take the offer,2021-10-26T01:53:44Z
$PQEFF Can someone please explain to me how to transfer shares when the ticker is halted? I&#39;m not actually going to do it, but it would be nice to know.,2021-10-26T01:52:47Z
$PPBT Purple Fam anyone following or own $PQEFF ?,2021-10-26T01:48:18Z
$PQEFF so whatâ€™s the deal here ? Buy out ? Errr can someone point me in the right direction,2021-10-26T01:47:50Z
$pqeff honestly Viston United is probably terrified now that they&#39;ve just put their offer up so visibly to the public. even with their shit talking about management they spoke openly about how amazing and useful this technology is. they know damn well another big player is going to see all of the DD they&#39;ve done and quickly come to the same conclusion. unless you all vote yes in a couple of days, more offers are going to be on the table. I get it, 4x your money gauranteed is attractive, but try to have a macro perspective. selling this at 60 cents is like selling $btc at a few hundred bucks a coin.,2021-10-26T01:44:29Z
$PQEFF will I accept the offer? I think it may be a little bit,2021-10-26T01:34:40Z
$PQEFF not greedy I&#39;ll take the buyout how do I participate...will the price go up to that buyout offer tomorrow?,2021-10-26T01:30:29Z

$PQEFF waitâ€¦you donâ€™t get the funds immediately??? Fuck me ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,2021-10-26T01:24:31Z
$PQEFF I threw a hail mary here with 100 percent of my portfolio very recently. I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s getting this real this quick.,2021-10-26T01:15:35Z
$PQEFF what is everyone going to do?,2021-10-26T01:14:19Z
