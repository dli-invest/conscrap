$PQEFF yehaa, the pump post machine is on!! Dumb money flowing in ü§ëü§ëü§ëüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ,2021-10-29T05:29:52Z
$PQEFF If everyone of us on here buys a 1000 shares tomorrow and gets one friend or family member to do the same that will equate to 5,030,000 shares. Think how fast that can dry up the float if we do that every day for a month. I&#39;m up for the challenge, who&#39;s with me?,2021-10-29T05:26:55Z
$PQEFF it is a multibagger,2021-10-29T04:47:21Z
$PQEFF still incredible buying opportunity around 20 cents! Watch this stock rally!,2021-10-29T04:45:10Z

Dear Petroteq,
 
I am writing you with regards to the attempted acquisition by Viston. As investors, we have an interest in maximizing shareholder value. With that in mind, we would like to have an indication of the direction that this company will undertake moving forward. This would include beyond statements such as ‚Äúincreasing shareholder value‚Äù, but could expound upon whether you intend to accept or negotiate a better offer from the same party, attempt to partner with another party to develop your technology, or attempt to raise capital and continue to operate independently. Simply put, because the offer by Viston represents a premium of approximately 3x the current share price as of 10/28/21, we want to know how Petroteq  intends to develop should we decline to tender our shares to Viston. ,2021-10-29T03:19:34Z
$PQEFF Does anyone remember on The Simpsons when Homer has a teddy bear that was Mr. Burns and Burns invites Homer over to negotiate the purchase, Homer keeps repeating in his head ‚Äúdon‚Äôt take the first offer!‚Äù, Mr. Burns welcomes him into his house and says ‚ÄúCan I offer you a cup of coffee?‚Äù And Homer yells, ‚ÄúNo Deal!‚Äù and leaves? Well 74 cents is our cup of coffee lol,2021-10-29T03:15:08Z
$PQEFF trade cautiously,2021-10-29T02:52:08Z
$PQEFF let petroteq know that you oppose a poison pill.
they need to find a better offer, a joint venture partner, or endorse the current offer.

$PQEFF look the best way to make money is simple. Email the board, tell them no Poison pill before they respond Tuesday after next. Enough shareholders do that, then they might think twice.  If there is no Poison pill, buy as much of this stock as possible and either tender your shares in january or even better have someone else buyout the company at a higher price. If the company poison pills, then this goes back down to 10 cents and you end up with üí©üí©üí©,2021-10-29T01:57:29Z
$MVIS hostile takeover and buyout on the table for shareholders over at $PQEFF. currently trading at 21 cents and offer is for 60 cents. shareholders have until February to accept the terms and buyer needs 51 percent of shareholders to agree to complete transaction. another offer could pop up or of nowhere too from a different party at the technology is incredibly valuable and disruptive for the oil industry. but even if there isn&#39;t another offer, there&#39;s 200 percent upside from here.,2021-10-29T01:45:23Z
$PQEFF these guys need this tech! https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/oil-sands-pathways-alliance-outlines-three-phase-plan-to-achieve-goal-of-net-zero-emissions-881120319.html,2021-10-29T01:32:42Z
$PQEFF one of these companies has to be interested in the CORT technology https://cdn-ceo-ca.s3.amazonaws.com/1gnmejm-Largest-Oil-and-Gas-companies.jpg,2021-10-29T01:27:36Z
$PQEFF hypothetically if I were in the situation of seriously buying something I would want people to think it has less value so I could get a better deal.

Now saying again hypothetically what if when ‚Äúthe buyer‚Äùhad intents to buy/ takeover this company back before summer that they were accumulating large amounts of shares for this exact moment. That means they accumulated a lot of shares for a major discount now they‚Äôre selling those shares back for major profit and also keeping there price down and appear weak. 

Anyone else feel this could be the case ?,2021-10-29T00:56:26Z
$PQEFF So it is my guess the share price is being held at or near 0.20 while PQEFF CEO &amp; BOARD negotiate another deal where PQEFF share holders get bought out with shares or cash from purchasing Company.,2021-10-29T00:45:06Z
$PQEFF does anyone know if there‚Äôs a cutoff date the offerer will honor your shares? Meaning they will only buy the amount of shares you had when they announced the buyout? Or can we still keep loading up now and until they reach 50%+1 and be paid for all the shares regardless of when we purchased them?,2021-10-29T00:40:43Z
$PQEFF hey Petrobros

Now that we know more about the form, format and function for Tender Offer&#39;s,  maybe there&#39;s some other Tender Offer (TO)  plays to track and trade

$PQEFF put an order in for morning to start a position here, time to support the smaller companies,2021-10-28T23:19:43Z
$PQEFF price action is whacky. hell even if there was no buyout, we have confirmation that this stock is MASSIVELY undervalued. 60 cents is their low-ball offer. you can get in, and if Petroteq doesn&#39;t deliver a better option, we can still take the offer. they&#39;ll get 51 percent if Petroteq doesn&#39;t give us a great alternative option. I think they will, but damn the FUD some people have is so dumb.,2021-10-28T23:17:29Z
$PQEFF There are more options to come out way ahead than not to at this point.,2021-10-28T23:12:19Z

$PQEFF I get the pump and dump!  It‚Äôs not for me.  But this all looks like kinda no friggin risk .  .60 if it goes threw.  The tech works and apparently companies already want it.

$PQEFF @kcuf, an account created two days ago, is an obvious shill for the Bidder.  They&#39;re in here saying &quot;Well geez, they haven&#39;t been able to sell this tech in six years, we all shoudl sell.&quot;  Meanwhile the tech was only 3rd party verified in late July

They&#39;re already sending paid shills to the message boards.  Are you starting to understand how desperate they are?,2021-10-28T22:22:52Z
