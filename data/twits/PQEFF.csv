$PQEFF Here is my opinion about current oil sand production example Suncor Fort Hills plant, the plant cost and estimated $17B to build and produces 85,000 BPD (to get 85,000 BPD with PQE‚Äôs tech would take 17 plants running at 5k per day at a cost of $125M per plant is $2.125B) the amount of water and tailings ponds the current oil sands projects produce is troublesome for the environment plus PQE is also able to sell the clean sand after the process and use no water. How much would this tech be worth to Suncor if they can build 17 smaller plants for $2B and produce the same oil and sell sand and not have waste water like their current $17B facility?,2021-12-02T03:41:05Z
$EEENF $FTXP 372m in assets after risk only a 10m market cap meaning this is 1/37 of true value expect a big increase these next few days real price is at least 4 cents!!.

$PQEFF wtf 0.60 takeover bid and it floats like a whyte turd in the yard? Wait it out....,2021-12-02T02:48:42Z
$PQEFF little disappointed our watchers are so low with risk v reward so high.,2021-12-02T01:38:06Z
$PQEFF Daily short sale volume has tapered off a little here since after Thanksgiving, with it hovering around 20% the past three trading days.,2021-12-02T00:20:00Z
$PQEFF seems like Viston is worried about the Haywood valuation? Lots of people screaming to tender their shares lol. No thanks we will wait and see what the report says, absolutely no benefit to shareholders to tender before end of January,2021-12-02T00:17:39Z
$PQEFF Some of you are extremely desperate for cash and it shows.  The people screaming the loudest about this probably have 5-20K shares at best,2021-12-01T23:49:52Z
$PQEFF We all knew the plans of licensing for $2M and 5% royalty so no one should find this shocking. Someone get a calculator, how many plants need to be licensed and running collecting 5% royalty on oil before they can be profitable? 20, 100, 500?,2021-12-01T22:41:07Z
$PQEFF ‚Äúa one-time, non-refundable license fee of ‚ÄéUS$2 million‚Äú 
why so cheap? why only 5% royalty. 
TAKE THE OFFER GUYS,2021-12-01T22:10:59Z
$PQEFF guys we need some news.üî• Lets form an llc and sign a contract with it.üòú But wait we have no money. üò≠no worries we can just make it non payable until they build the plantüòÜ 

Under the Agreement, ‚ÄéBig Sky has agreed to pay Petroteq a one-time, non-refundable license fee of ‚ÄéUS$2 million, which will become payable upon the commencement by Big Sky of construction of its first ‚Äéplant.,2021-12-01T21:28:56Z

$PQEFF  Just doing a little figuring for fun. At $11 a ton a 5000 barrel a day plant would generate 20 million a year just in sand sales. What am I missing here?,2021-12-01T21:09:17Z
$PQEFF just filed with the SEC a Regulated Disclosure https://last10k.com/sec-filings/pqeff/0001062993-21-011879.htm?utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=forum&amp;utm_campaign=8K&amp;utm_term=pqeff,2021-12-01T21:01:06Z

$PQEFF Chevron and ConnocoPhillips bragging on their website about using a proprietary process that uses 99% recycled water or when possible brackish water so as to not waste the water. This is their current opinion of ‚Äúgreen‚Äù. The fact that petroteq uses no water, is unheard of, not only is water not wasted, there‚Äôs also no wastewater byproduct. This is what is green, and big oil is desperate to get this technology, so what you will, but yes this is worth 10x more than $0.59 per share,2021-12-01T20:22:26Z

$PQEFF the value of petroteq has not been fully revealed, this is much more than extracting oil. Solvents also applicable to gas, sand remediation. This I believe is an undiscovered gem, hand tight,2021-12-01T19:10:07Z
$PQEFF who would have thought a sand shortage, but one of top 3 most consumable good on earth, now with infrastructure in play‚Ä¶But Desert sand is too smooth for cement and construction purposes, must be angular for locking, found underground in quarries or seabeds only https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/03/05/sand-shortage-the-world-is-running-out-of-a-crucial-commodity.html,2021-12-01T19:07:39Z
$PQEFF interesting the Twitter account has not been active for nearly 3 weeks, whereas a post would normally go out every few days. I think a massive PR will hit any day now prior to Christmas break,2021-12-01T18:32:34Z
$PQEFF i wonder what he‚Äôll do with his shares after leaving. Someone could talk to him lol

In connection with Mr. Stapleton‚Äôs recruitment and as part of his compensation package with Petroteq he was awarded 1,000,000 common shares of the Company and incentive stock options vesting over eight months for 3,000,000 common shares at $0.085 per share expiring after five years.,2021-12-01T18:29:59Z
$PQEFF This license deal is not material.  The company didn&#39;t have to announce it and they shouldn&#39;t have.  All this accomplished was to make mgmt look desperate.,2021-12-01T18:14:55Z
$PQEFF why tender you shares so early I mean it¬¥s like being 3 hours before opening hours at the supermarket - there¬¥s no benefit or when negotiating a price you don¬¥t have to show how much you want the product you can play it cool be like ah we¬¥ll see and maybe they make a better price so as in a lot of aspects in life premature &quot;actions&quot; are not always the most satisfying. Stay relaxed see what happens if nothing better comes up tender your shares like all of us but don¬¥t give up your only weapon of negotiating,2021-12-01T18:08:59Z
$PQEFF not going anywhere until I see .60 . Bring the buy out deal,2021-12-01T18:08:35Z
$PQEFF Is this a joke? A license to a company no one has ever heard of that doesn‚Äôt have a single plant and has never extracted a drop of oil? No license fees unless and until constrution of the licensee&#39;s first plant?

Viston HQ is erupting with laughter today.,2021-12-01T18:05:57Z
$PQEFF I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if George Stapleton pops up as a new employee of another player here, possibly Valkor???,2021-12-01T16:59:40Z
$PQEFF super low volume so far today,2021-12-01T16:49:49Z
$PQEFF TENDER YOUR SHARES GUYS,2021-12-01T16:44:56Z
