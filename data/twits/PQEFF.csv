$PQEFF the Bellridge selling just happened as they appear to have to report quickly...,2021-12-03T00:42:46Z
$PQEFF Here’s a thought... Bellridge sells enough shares at good profit to get them below 5%. Now they don’t have to report transactions as they are below threshold level for “insiders”. They can tender or do what they want any time without having to report and show their hand.,2021-12-03T00:31:12Z
$PQEFF all I know is by the end of January I&#39;m selling all of my earthly possessions, taking a reverse mortgage on my home, taking out a bank loan, borrowing $ from my family and buying up every share of PQEFF that I can.

It looks like we&#39;re going to tender. Maybe something will happen in Dec or Jan so who knows. But if worst case scenario I can sell for .74CAD you better believe I&#39;m emptyingy pockets.,2021-12-03T00:22:55Z
$PQEFF what caused this?,2021-12-02T23:25:18Z
$PQEFF News from George Stapleton, the previous COO... He is still working for Petroteq,2021-12-02T22:24:38Z
$PQEFF So, with an offer on the table that expires in about 60 days, why would a major shareholder (who was holding about 7.5%) sell about 1/3 of their holdings in PQEFF (roughly 13 million shares) at price that is less than 1/3 of the offer price?     What do they know that we don&#39;t?,2021-12-02T21:13:35Z
$PQEFF Stopped in at the end of the day. Too many tool bags saying &quot;tender&quot; and &quot;valuation won&#39;t matter&quot;. Just idiotic stuff coming from people. I&#39;m leaving again, but I&#39;ll predict. A. I will not tender my shares unless Bailey himself tells me to. B. Viston won&#39;t come anywhere close to 50% plus one. C. After all the tools take their shares out of tendering in February, I&#39;ll be holding mine and cashing out big one day.....You all don&#39;t need to message me with your nonsense either, I&#39;ve heard it from you all already....you know who you are, Viston pumpers...PQEFF STRONG!!!,2021-12-02T20:51:40Z
$PQEFF I won&#39;t say who this is from but I will say it&#39;s great advice coming from an oil guy

I will be waiting for the recommendation from Petroteq&#39;s Board once Haywood completes its evaluation. Hoping we see a higher offer before all is said and done. I am certainly not in a position to offer investment advice, but for now I will wait to see where we are around mid-January.,2021-12-02T19:34:40Z
$PQEFF i am truly confused lol,2021-12-02T19:25:03Z
$PQEFF things just got interesting

$PQEFF Exactly 0.00% change on the 6M chart. The daily swings can make one to lose track as to how stable this really is. All distractions aside, from a TA perspective its quite obvious where this is headed...,2021-12-02T18:13:34Z
$TGGI , $RMSL , and $PQEFF are my biggest plays right now. 

TGGI - a shell company to merge 5 liquor companies into one, management has been very active and plans to be OTCQB and be listed on nasdaq by end of year next year. all we need to kick this off is the 8k to be filed, which is expected soon.(2-4weeks out)

RMSL- created a new type of sleep apnea mask that had to be tested for droplets, tests started November 10th and expectation is 4 weeks from start date will be the results and FDA approval. 

PQEFF- oil sands company that is able to extract oil with out using water. they did the tests and were successful and then had immediate buy out offer right after. current price is $.15 and some change but the buy out offer is just under $.60 per share. waiting on the valuation and if they need to ask for more or take the offer. final days to accept offer is in the first week in February.,2021-12-02T17:35:22Z
$PQEFF volume today is microscopic. Not sweating price action at all but I&#39;ll be avging down if it drops below my avg,2021-12-02T17:11:15Z
$PQEFF I need CAD to really strengthen relative to USD in the next couple of months please.,2021-12-02T16:56:35Z
$PQEFF The haywood valuation will make everything worse. A - there is no legitimacy behind it really since the Company hired them B - if the value is high, it will only feed management delusion not to just accept Viston offer,2021-12-02T16:45:37Z
$PQEFF no doubt haywood valuation comes higher than viston offer, but anyone want to guess how higher? place your bets everyone. The higher the better lol,2021-12-02T16:40:21Z
$PQEFF Petroleum club tomorrow?  Gonna see if I can go. Have somebody who is gonna be there and will ask if I can tag along.  Now that would be a place to see if I can get any info.,2021-12-02T16:30:36Z
$PQEFF When the Haywood report does come out, it will no doubt contain a comprehensive evaluation of PQE along with valuation. This could be used to get Viston to raise their offer, or do we all believe that Viston first offer is their best offer? In my opinion 0.74c is a seriously lowball offer. It also doesn&#39;t matter if 100% of PIs tender their shares, Viston will not get the 50% +1 shares they need. It needs the huge holders to tender, so all this talk of tender your shares is just daft..Wait to hear what PQE recommend.,2021-12-02T16:21:59Z
$PQEFF For all those comments about management dragging their feet, etc. Have a look at the Canadian Securities law in regards to unsolicited takeover bids (page 31 of the attached document), &quot;In responding to an unsolicited offer, the target is not obligated to negotiate with the bidder or to sell. However, the case law, including the Supreme Court’s decision in BCE, makes it clear that where the board determines that a change of control is likely to be the consequence, it is reasonable for it to conduct a competitive process. Considering their duties and to whom they are owed as set out above, the directors must inform themselves of what is faire value, the factors and criteria that affect the value and valuation, and the options available to the target in the circumstances. Expert advice is typically obtained to assist the board in addressing these requirements.&quot; So to me, even if the board wanted to accept the offer of 74 cents they would legally have to delay,2021-12-02T15:49:36Z
$PQEFF need that Haywood report ASAP. That is the golden ticket to a “better offer” — if it doesn’t come out until late January it’s too late IMO.,2021-12-02T15:43:30Z
$PQEFF What’s with the low volume today?,2021-12-02T15:43:02Z
$PQEFF tender your shares it’s the only way,2021-12-02T15:35:03Z

$PQEFF ,2021-12-02T14:56:49Z
$PQEFF Current mgmt structure appears to be signaling that they aren&#39;t going to move forward on their own. I expect that this buyout will go through, unless a white knight shows up. With the departure of the Executive team and with the CEO in his 80s, there wouldn&#39;t appear to be any incentive for the board to dilute the share structure to prevent the takeover, so I think this is a good buying opportunity to hold for 2.5 months and see a 300% return. Good luck.,2021-12-02T13:54:51Z
$PQEFF will stapleton tender or sell? thats the question,2021-12-02T12:36:13Z

 https://s.flashalert.me/LBoQU,2021-12-02T12:13:18Z
$PQEFF Here is my opinion about current oil sand production example Suncor Fort Hills plant, the plant cost and estimated $17B to build and produces 85,000 BPD (to get 85,000 BPD with PQE’s tech would take 17 plants running at 5k per day at a cost of $125M per plant is $2.125B) the amount of water and tailings ponds the current oil sands projects produce is troublesome for the environment plus PQE is also able to sell the clean sand after the process and use no water. How much would this tech be worth to Suncor if they can build 17 smaller plants for $2B and produce the same oil and sell sand and not have waste water like their current $17B facility?,2021-12-02T03:41:05Z
