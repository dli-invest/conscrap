$PQEFF anyone here owns shares on tsx? how are you coping with over 3 months already lock up? i believe everyone on tsx are going to tender, right?,2021-11-23T16:26:20Z
$PQEFF to be fair, its a great buying area, could potentially test 14.7c area DCA, tech is bullish for me, management not so much,2021-11-23T16:12:28Z
$PQEFF I will not be tendering my shares until at the earliest January. There isn&#39;t a hope in hell that Viston will get 50% unless the big big holders tender. The upcoming Haywood report will be very interesting, i expect it to value it at multiples of Viston derisory offer. Although 0.74c seems a hell of a lot and compared to todays share price it is, but this technology ticks all the boxes and is huge.,2021-11-23T15:58:55Z
