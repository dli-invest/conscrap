$PQEFF my take after reading the response:
- the Viston offer is likely the floor
- the process will take a maddeningly long time to play out
- share price may dwindle over next few months while people get impatient
- this is an outstanding opportunity to find more cash and continue to grow our positions as shareholders - the Viston offer is likely the lowest price outcome after Feb 2022.  

When have you ever had money just handed to you like this before?!?!!!,2021-11-09T05:18:27Z
$PQEFF One example of Haywood‚Äôs work is Reco.v where on Nov 5, 2020 they issued the report stating the current price of 91 cents had a target of $2.50, current price is $7.21 (in case someone wants to say they exaggerate their valuations) I haven‚Äôt looked into any others but I bet quite a few people will at least look at their PQE report,2021-11-09T04:36:58Z
$PQEFF The TSXV is delaying PQEFF&#39;s listing on purpose.  Someone made a call.  &#39;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll keep them bogged down until you grab them for cheap Viston&quot;...,2021-11-09T04:36:19Z

$PQEFF  The board of directors is in serious danger of getting sued for absconding on their fiduciary responsibility to shareholders.  People here don&#39;t seem to understand how rare 300% buyout offers are.  
 
Everybody has faith their penny stock is headed for the moon. That doesn&#39;t hold up in court for a stock that&#39;s plunged from $30 to one Dime over 8 years,2021-11-09T04:22:26Z
$PQEFF has engaged with an investment banker  (Haywood Securities ) to most likely do a DCF analysis of their pro form‚Äôd financials using certain assumptions regarding their royalty or full production cash flows. They will make a determination of what their future EBITDA is worth in conjunction with 3rd party financials, and use their connections to find the right strategic buyer or PEG to pay the true multiple of what their billion $ technology is actually worth. This is great news from PQ and is is great that they have signed with an IB to advocate for them, everyone should feel a sense of reassurance as this is not a lame duck response from management, but very much an affirmation of their commitment to enhancing stakeholder value.,2021-11-09T04:00:15Z

$PQEFF This part is interesting ‚Äú Haywood Securities Inc. (‚ÄúHaywood‚Äù) was formally engaged by Petroteq to act as financial advisor to Petroteq and the Petroteq Board pursuant to an engagement agreement effective November 6, 2021. Under the terms of the engagement agreement, Haywood has agreed to provide Petroteq and the Petroteq Board with various advisory services in connection with the review of possible investments in, or strategic transactions involving, Petroteq, with the primary objective of identifying potential strategic partners and providing financial advice and assistance in connection with the consummation of any such transaction.‚Äù seems they are hiring Haywood to value the company as an investment but ‚Äúprimary objective‚Äù of identifying potential strategic partners. Seems like Haywood has better access to companies looking to invest in game changing technology, again let the bidding war begin!,2021-11-09T03:33:22Z
$PQEFF as a shareholder it&#39;s not Vistan&#39;s offer that interests me it&#39;s what position Valkor and TomCo will take. From my understanding it is Valkor who brought on Tomco -not only financed the projects but made this a minimum viable product ready for Market. Valkor is also a Non-exclusive licensee. TOMCO has shareholders, like us. Like Petroteq they are also looking for financing to continue their project. To be continued.,2021-11-09T03:24:26Z
$PQEFF I just got back, saw Petroteq&#39;s response. I thought they would offer no opinion on whether to take the offer or not. They got blindsided by a company that wants to steal their tech for pennies. I know people will tender, you can tell who THOSE people are by their comments. They won&#39;t get anywhere near enough shares. It was a hold when the offer was a rumor, it was a hold when the FEED and CORT studies passed with flying colors, it was a hold when Viston made their hostile takeover public, and its still a hold until Petroteq lays out their plans for the future. Whether they work a deal with someone else, or multiple deals with multiple companies, coupled with expanding their production and making royalty deals that come along, I&#39;m holding. I&#39;m staying with the tech, its pretty clear its worth more than .1795 a share. I think they think its also worth more than .60 a share too. Not selling, not tendering, next goal for me is seeing what happens when trade restriction is lifted...,2021-11-09T03:15:01Z
$PQEFF Bull case - don‚Äôt tender your shares until just before the deadline, gives the board leverage in dealing with Viston for a higher offer! Bear case - don‚Äôt tender your shares until just before the deadline, the board will think the offer will not be accepted and therefore will not issue a poison pill! Viston shill case - tender shares ASAP so Viston knows they have 50%+1 secured so they don‚Äôt need to negotiate at all,2021-11-09T02:33:06Z
$PQEFF so how long do y‚Äôall think the evaluation will take?,2021-11-09T02:31:28Z
$PQEFF No bad news here,2021-11-09T02:14:42Z
$PQEFF the directors circular is on Sedar. It is a comedy. With this share count, i should be on the board. Good reas tho

None of the directors or senior officers of Petroteq, who collectively hold 4,590,313 Common Shares, has accepted or  rejected the Viston Offer at this tim,2021-11-09T02:12:35Z
$PQEFF At the bare minimum the board will want to negotiate with Viston for a small increase (like say 5 cents a share) so at the end of the day they can say that they got shareholders the best deal, best case they get some amazing JV or financing deal setup with additional licensing deals etc, but the first scenario won‚Äôt happen if people tender their shares too early, you take away all leverage in negotiations if a large number of shares are tendered too early,2021-11-09T01:42:25Z
$PQEFF viston response soon?,2021-11-09T01:25:20Z
$PQEFF I just ask questions and been here for at least little while. Lotta drama with all going on. It‚Äôs all just speculation for everyone at this point. Would love to be a fly on the wall in Viston and/or Petroteq office. GLTA.,2021-11-09T01:18:20Z
$PQEFF the only ones who are shady and exaggerate are the FUD spreaders.. let me know when they make someone money or try to help... hold on to your PQEFF shares.. deals take time.

Once TSX halt lifted, the insiders and heavyweights can start buying PQEFF shares again and they will.

My last 2 recommendations on here were JP and OTTEF... all I do is try to make people money.....,2021-11-09T01:11:00Z
$PQEFF just remember the Cort technology was just verified by a third-party...petroteq took a long time to get to this point..why sell this low this fast...I got time and patience...capital gains keep decreasing,2021-11-09T01:07:22Z
$PQEFF Viston Is making an offer which they think is fair I believe that offer will drop before February,2021-11-09T00:54:45Z
$PQEFF How come no one is calling Viston out, for the way they behaved? Why is  pqeff getting the blame for everything? At least they created something. Some big fish is behind that takeover offer. Exon suspending their sand oil processing in Canada because it was too expensive. Am I missing something here????? Hold you shares!,2021-11-09T00:50:55Z
$PQEFF personally, I don‚Äôt see sp rising until December/January. Not a big time restraint to buy or stay in until sp rises closer to .6 (.74),2021-11-09T00:48:20Z
$PQEFF It sounds like they are going to be very active over the next few weeks. Getting a valuation from Haywood is a good strategy which should help them find a merger or cooperation partner. The vaulation will also enable everyone to get a feel for how fair Viston&#39;s offer is. PQE has explicitly mentioned a poison pill as an option, but they would probably use the money to finance the plant. Overall, the letter strikes me as pretty smart and well written. They seem to have good people advising them.,2021-11-09T00:27:04Z

$PQEFF Why is it when Hayward raises money they always raise it like 20% lower than what the prices? Not expecting much from them,2021-11-09T00:25:44Z
