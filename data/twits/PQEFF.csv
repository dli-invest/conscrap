$PQEFF  Well the bad news is that since the extension the currency conversion rate has been moving against us from a high of near 59 cents a share back to .5805 at the moment.

$PQEFF 
There&#39;s a likely chance we&#39;ll know the situation of the tender offer next Friday with most brokers deadline being from next Wednesday onwards.
We&#39;ll hopefully get our money a week after that then and onwards and upwards to the next thing üëç
Not long left to go everyone üôè,2022-02-18T10:28:31Z
$CEI  Sorry not sorry for the spam:  Want to make up some of your CEI losses? Still not too late to buy $PQEFF for 40 cents and cash out for 58 cent buyout offer at the end of the month, less than two weeks away.  Jump back in beginning of march if you must but buy viking this time which is still worth something if CEI fails.   
 
Tender your PQEFF shares by calling your broker before Feb 23rd.

$PQEFF Hey guys, I am able to purchase PQE on the TSX but was told that I has been halted since the summer. If my order goes through, can I still tender? I don&#39;t even understand how it is still going through though lol.,2022-02-17T20:17:47Z
$PQEFF I&#39;m probably not alone is having a few major financial decisions on hold for the next couple weeks.  It&#39;s either &quot;I&#39;ll be pinching pennies starting in march or this will be no problem&#39;,2022-02-17T20:03:56Z
