$PQEFF  Is it 50/50, 75/25, 90/10‚Ä¶chance that one will get 50% return 6 trading days from now? That is the question. I believe I‚Äôm in 50/50 camp since I haven‚Äôt added since the announcement.,2022-01-30T02:02:16Z
$PQEFF  I&#39;m not inclined to chicken out on the way-too-many shares I&#39;ve tendered, but the payout can&#39;t come soon enough for me.  My real concern is that it looks the buyers are closely tied to Ukraine which is about to be invade. Nothing is more disruptive than that.  
One can say &quot;they have the money reserved&quot; etc, but I think it&#39;s all whistling past a graveyard.  Of course it&#39;s a political risk at play, but then again, we&#39;re almost home,2022-01-30T00:09:09Z

With all the additional buying and tendering being reported here, it seems like sellers are cashing out for a guaranteed .39 USD, while the buyers are tendering for the potential .59 USD, which helps the offer become a self fulfilling prophecy.,2022-01-28T21:25:22Z

If you do not tender and the deal goes through the stock may trade for a few more days then at some point be delisted. Your shares will be in limbo at this point until all legal requirements for the acquisition are met. This could take several weeks or months. Then your broker will be contacted and you will receive new stock ( if acquiring company is a public company) or cash, equivalent to the tender price in your account.,2022-01-28T19:49:46Z

$PQEFF Did anyone tender with scotia itrade? I did a couple of weeks ago but the shares are still in my account, just wondering if anyone else has had a similar thing happen. Just want to make sure my shares are actually tendered.,2022-01-28T17:21:59Z
$PQEFF tendered just a touch under 50k shares through fidelity today.  Was told it usually takes a &quot;couple of days&quot; for funds to get put into my account after the deal goes through.  When he was verifying that it was Petroteq, he also mentioned that a client yesterday also tendered a large number of shares.  I&#39;ll say watching almost $20k leave your account in a 5 min period doesn&#39;t feel good.  But if it is getting replaced with $30k you can&#39;t really complain.  Now the wait game.,2022-01-28T17:04:14Z

$PQEFF hey Petroteq fam - for my Canadians who trade with TD - are you able to buy PQEFF through their system or does it get blocked? I know with RBC I can buy PQEFF as long as I convert to USD first and then execute, was wondering if this is possible with TD. I have had friends tell me no - also similar issue with Questrade. I‚Äôm trying to make friends and family money on this with the little time we have left. Thanks!,2022-01-28T15:14:04Z
