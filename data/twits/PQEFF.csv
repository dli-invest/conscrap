$PQEFF that bounced back fast enough lol,2022-01-18T14:58:04Z
$PQEFF ironically, as the price falls it becomes a more attractive investment.

Nothing about the risk profile has changed (perhaps you could argue as we get closer with total silence from Viston it hints at something) yet the share price drops on low volume.

With all the same information as when Viston commented on PQE‚Äôs recommendation to accept the tender, the profit potential on arbitrage (assuming the deal goes through) has gone from 32% to 66%.,2022-01-18T14:56:13Z
$PQEFF why is there no accumulation here?  If buyers know they can turn around and sell for almost double, I&#39;d think we&#39;d still be seeing more large buys.  Is the tender offer only good on shares purchased before a certain date?,2022-01-18T14:42:04Z
$PQEFF if you don‚Äôt tender and they own 50% +1, imagine they actually own more than that, so they can manipulate the sp or delution on the on long term and force you to sell with a lower price or you become a bagholderü§î,2022-01-18T14:27:21Z
$PQEFF  
HScott1 &quot;I know many people have asked this here, but I haven&#39;t seen an answer, of what happens if I decide not to tender and they get 90% of the people to tender or if they get 51%&quot; 
 
If they get 90% they can compulsory purchase the remainder at the same price. If 51% they will leave the offer on the table for another 10 days. Thereafter who knows? They may up their offer for remainder or may not, depends how badly they want them and how reluctant the sellers are????,2022-01-18T12:59:59Z
$PQEFF Tender now - be happy in 3 weeks,2022-01-18T11:58:58Z
$PQEFF what do you expect to happen with share price if offer gets extended?,2022-01-18T09:45:57Z
