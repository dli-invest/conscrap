$PQEFF anyone have info on TSX.V? Last thing I have is they are reviewing or some shit. 

Am I bag holding PQE.V?,2021-11-04T05:25:39Z
$PQEFF stay the course: slow and steady wins the race. The CEO of EXXON in the Middle East did not leave his post to run this little outfit in the middle of the American desert because he needed a change of scenery. The ‚Äúinsiders‚Äù of this company are not buying countless shares because they have nothing else to do with there money and are just bored. Everyone relax- we got this. And we are the tip of the Speer,2021-11-04T04:51:42Z
$PQEFF been following Petro 2 years and an investor over a year. This company has been bootstrapping and delivering and their tech is amazing and disruptive. 

Dr Bailey is CEO and Chairman of the board.. he will handle buyout negotiations or take us commercial. 

I look forward to why Petroteq thinks the offer is low and how they plan to unlock value. A lot can happen in 90 days... look at past month.,2021-11-04T02:39:04Z
$PQEFF listen to all you so called savvy investors that don‚Äôt really have a clue except for some that have been here awhile.  This is in negotiations with a LOW BALL offer on the table.  There will be a higher offer soon.  I‚Äôm holding out for $2

$PQEFF i‚Äôve been on the stock board since June and all of a sudden I‚Äôve noticed a whole lot of new users with accounts that were created within the last two weeks posting on here of how the stock is going to go down how we need to take the offer I‚Äôm calling bullshit on all you Nubes not falling for it. Wait till the board makes a statement over the offer and go from there why are you in such a rush you‚Äôre not gonna get paid until February at the earliest for this offer but you‚Äôre so quick to tinder shares how about you hold and just see what happens.,2021-11-04T00:47:00Z

$PQEFF happy to hold my bag of shares till I get at least USD 60 cents or CAD 74 cents per share. However it makes sense to reject offer and there is a fairly high chance the stock will run!,2021-11-04T00:02:52Z
$PQEFF Real curious to see the response from management. Right now this is one of the obvious no brainer stocks I am in. If or if not that continues to be the case will depend on this response.,2021-11-03T21:35:50Z

$PQEFF shareholders and share price today üò≠,2021-11-03T16:40:12Z
$PQEFF Very frustrated here and I&#39;m beginning to think PQE will never be trading again on TSX. 

The exchange want PQE to rectify their errors, (impossible) and PQE state they have done everything TSX have asked, = STALEMATE!!

Absolute disgrace as one of the main functions of the exchange should be to protect shareholders. This delay is severely disadvantaging them. Looks like I&#39;ll just have to hold what I have, (wanted to increase) and be at the mercy of the outcome....,2021-11-03T16:24:24Z

$PQEFF I found this resource that answered a lot of my questions about this takeover bid (Link below). First Viston CANNOT accelerate the bid unless PQE to a shorter timeline (which wouldn‚Äôt happen if they don‚Äôt recommend the bid) OR if PQE announces it enters into an alternative transaction (such as agreement between PQE and Viston, a rights offering etc.) so my interpretation from yesterday stands corrected. Other interesting things to note:
In Canada the take-over bid can only be cash (not subject to financing) which was one of the ‚Äúselling points‚Äù of Viston‚Äôs offer.
PQE must provide independent valuation of their shares (part of the due diligence of the board of PQE)
Very interesting wording about the ‚ÄúSecond Step Transcation‚Äù which could come into play for those who hold out and do not tender their shares:
