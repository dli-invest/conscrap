After a quick read they seem to be after PATENTS and further down they seem to want to get away from fossil fuels.

$PQEFF Anyone know anything about ENEFIT and the oil sands project they are trying to put in next to Petroteq at Asphalt Ridge? Sounds like they would be a natural fit for possible joint venture,2021-11-14T17:10:24Z
$PQEFF Interesting how Switzerland jumped to the top of the google trends search for Petroteq, the US isnâ€™t even in top 5, still really really unknown https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=Petroteq,2021-11-14T16:46:08Z
$PQEFF TSXV engage,2021-11-13T23:53:44Z
$PQEFF Think what you want but each plant that anyone else builds is cost free royalty revenue, if the top 5 oil sands producers each build one 10k BPD plant in 2 years that is 5 x 10k x 360 days x $80 per barrel x 5% royalty = $72M per year revenue on royalties alone from 1 plant each! Now break that into EPS assuming 800M fully diluted shares is 9 cents per share, and add an aggressive P/E of 30 (not unreasonable based on potential of billions of future barrels to unlock) and you arrive at a stock price of $0.09 x 30 = $2.70 , this is with $0 expenses to PQE. If they build the first 5K plant themselves (highly unlikely now that Haywood is looking for a strategic partnership who would likely fund the first plant) their base case EPS on that plant after OPEX of $25 per barrel is earnings net back of very conservative $25 per barrel x 5k x 360 days = $45M or $0.06 cents per share, again a growth P/E of just 30 gives a stock price on 800M shares of $1.80,2021-11-13T15:50:39Z
$XOM Should be one of the bidders on $PQEFF but I think they fell asleep...

$PQEFF Haywood will shoot us into the stratosphere.,2021-11-13T09:09:58Z
$PQEFF looking at Haywood&#39;s list of valuations in the past and comparing to the corresponding Stock Price/market cap at the time I can expect 2 things to happen when they drop their PQE report:

1) Disappointment from all of us when they value PQE at something like only 12 million CAD

2) Stock price to remain relatively unchanged.

Don&#39;t forget that stock price is not a linear reflection of co.&#39;s valuation. And that goes 10x for growth companies.,2021-11-13T06:17:57Z
