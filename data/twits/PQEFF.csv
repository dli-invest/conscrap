$PQEFF unlikely we see anything from Haywood this week given the shortened trade week. Could see something as early as next week though. February is closer than the inpatient folks realize,  but the company has to know people are getting antsy and may start tendering.,2021-11-22T04:37:32Z

$PQEFF Interesting theory I recently heard from someone whose opinion I value: if Viston doesn&#39;t get the 50+1, they will still go through with the purchase of tendered shares (which they can opt to do according to the packet they sent) and then negotiate a higher second offer.  The idea being people are far less inclined to tender shares if a company says &quot;Yeah, tender and we&#39;ll buy whatever&quot; rather than &quot;Hey listen, if we don&#39;t get enough everyone misses out.&quot;  The latter adds urgency.

I could see this because it&#39;s odd to think they&#39;d get, say, 40% and then decide &quot;Nah, not good enough&quot; and move on.  

Just a theoy, but an interesting one,2021-11-20T18:18:13Z
$PQEFF Then combine that oil with Quadrise technology for shipping fuel and you are even more green!  https://cdn-ceo-ca.s3.amazonaws.com/1gpi5hn-EB7F07CD-E241-4FAB-8A6C-08761B2636B8.jpeg,2021-11-20T15:38:02Z
$PQEFF Still think this technology is worth only 74 cents? We are talking billions of barrels in Utah alone, TRILLIONS of dollars! Let’s give the patent away for $500 million dollars because management who spent 10 years proving the tech made some mistakes? No thank you! https://cdn-ceo-ca.s3.amazonaws.com/1gpi56r-6D66249A-F025-4D63-9DF7-5C1B762CC27F.jpeg,2021-11-20T15:32:45Z
