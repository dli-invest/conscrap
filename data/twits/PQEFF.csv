2) understand what you own 
3) able to  accurately measure present value compared with current SP

$PQEFF This thing keeps gapping up and retracing to fill it, very bullish sign of an imminent explosion. Thanks for whoever posted this yearly candlestick. And whoever it is that keeps saying charting patterns is not possible with OTC or low MC, please save it, I was in MRIN at $2.34, BBIG at $1.89, ANY at $2.66, SCKT at $2.67, and HMBL at $0.007. This one will be next soon enough, cherry on top with this one are the many catalysts,2021-12-28T22:23:53Z
$GXXM Someone loaded 12 million shares today.... 6x the daily average volume and a 5 million share order at market close... Market cap under $6 million.

If you don&#39;t see the writing on the wall then I&#39;m sorry.

$PQEFF it feels like someone tries to drop the price of this every day at the end of the day I‚Äôm not sure why, but I feel like it‚Äôs a bullish sign that they failed today,2021-12-28T21:26:06Z

$PQEFF if they want to give you .74 usd that means it worth 1.50 wake up people,2021-12-28T20:20:05Z

$PQEFF the purpose of these message boards is to exchange ideas and help one another so thanks to those who did. I didn&#39;t know i can transfer Canadian to American. I have peanuts but was hoping for a new user car as i was trading it for months before the halt. I hope we all make money whether it be nickels dimes or huge dollars . Cheers to all. As we all have our own stories.,2021-12-28T18:53:17Z
$PQEFF its so obvious it seems like a trap but sometimes it is that obvious,2021-12-28T18:34:06Z
$PQEFF In 375k shares so far,2021-12-28T18:18:55Z
$PQEFF Seems if someone wants to hold it below 18cü§î,2021-12-28T18:05:06Z
$PQEFF it&#39;s curious how when this hits 18c suddenly someone wants to put in an ask in the 17s again.  I&#39;m not a stock/MM conspiracy theorist so I&#39;m not gonna claim it&#39;s viston holding them down or something silly but it does strike me as odd.,2021-12-28T17:59:22Z

$PQEFF  Whose brokers have offered them the tender offer? I have Interactive brokers which has a super lame corporate actions department. They often do things past deadline.   
Thinking to transfer the shares to Etrade or Fidelity or ??,2021-12-28T17:36:19Z

$PQEFF anymore tweets from our favorite company?,2021-12-28T16:33:10Z
$PQEFF ‚ÄúNever accept the first offer in any business transaction. Never.‚Äù Only works IF you have negotiating power. With 18 cents, TSX still halted, no plant funding path, various  holes in leadership positions‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt.  
 
Still holding for mid January and hoping for a rabbit pull, but  realistically tendering. Happy for the 4-5x.,2021-12-28T16:24:47Z
