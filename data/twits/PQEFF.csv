$PQEFF what&#39;s everybody&#39;s guess on the opening bid? I&#39;m guessing that this could dip a bit before climbing later in the week?,2022-01-03T01:37:40Z
$PQEFF If you&#39;re shooting for mid-month as your do-or-die decision moment, some things to consider. The 14 falls on a Friday, the 17 on a Monday. However, all markets will be closed on Monday, January 17. Also, a few banks may have closings over the weekend too, as well as the 17. My primary bank, for example, is closed Saturday the 15 through Monday the 17. May not affect you much, but worth pointing out, particularly since I&#39;ve seen posts about making a tender decision by mid-month.,2022-01-03T00:07:16Z
$PQEFF I am not tendering until I get more information prior to the deadline.  It&#39;s that simple.  I can call Fidelity prior to the deadline at any time and tender, but until I have more information, I am not going to.  My opinion only:  there is nothing to lose by waiting.  Either way, I am going to make a decision prior to the deadline...all this other stuff is just speculation with zero facts.  If the company tells me something that is really interesting, or there is another offer...great!  If there is radio silence until the day before, great!  Either way, no decision to be made here until I have more information.,2022-01-02T21:37:28Z
$PQEFF it‚Äôs amazing to think that some of you are all about the quick buck which means tendering especially when the company is urging you NOT too.  You need to heed instructions and read between the lines.,2022-01-02T18:17:58Z

$PQEFF $PQEFF  There is a curious sentence in the Petroteq Directors Circular: ‚ÄúIt is Petroteq‚Äôs current intention not to disclose developments with respect to its Strategic Reciew process until the Petroteq Board has approved a specific transaction or otherwise determines that disclosure is necessary or appropriate.‚Äù 
Surely Haywood has finished the review by now, but also remember that part of the deal with Petroteq is that they will be paid ‚Äúa substantial portion of fees that is contingent upon the completion of any successful transaction.‚Äù    
Haywood wants to be paid, so they are either already in talks for potential deals or they are actively looking to find one.,2022-01-02T01:01:34Z

$PQEFF If someone had given you PQEFF as a lotto at .015 cents before the buy out would you have taken it? Really ask yourself and be honest. 

GXXM is my next OTC lotto. $10 million market cap so buying it today is the equivalent of being able to purchase PQEFF for .015. Is it a high risk play? Yes.... But then again so was PQEFF before the buy out. Sometimes you have to go with your gut and hold on tight.

GXXM nearest competitor on the OTC is $AABB who hit a $700 million market cap BEFORE the exchange went live. GXXM already has a functional exchange, is generating revenue per last week&#39;s news release with MMMM, and is going to launch CryptoBooks via Battlefin on the AWS network in 2022 in time for tax season. $10 million market cap. 

Risk it for the biscuit. Without this line of thinking I wouldn&#39;t have picked $DPLS up at .008 and I wouldn&#39;t have picked up PQEFF at .045. Happy new year to everyone, happy hunting this year. There is gold in them hills üíµüíµüíµ,2022-01-01T15:50:28Z

$PQEFF If the tender offer is 0.74 why not buy more and tender 1/15? It seems so obvious. Is there a catch I&#39;m not seeing?,2021-12-31T19:38:50Z
$PQEFF Be nice to see 2021 end with 21 cents. And 22 on Monday!,2021-12-31T19:23:44Z

$PQEFF I fear Viston is running up the stock with purchases and than in late January sell high and pull their offer.  Might be illegal to do that but not if they do it outside the company.,2021-12-31T18:17:12Z
