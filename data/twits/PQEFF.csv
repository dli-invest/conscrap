$PQEFF anyone want to guess what‚Äôs the likelihood of the deal going through? Silence from both companies right now.

I‚Äôd say we are looking at a 40% of a deal going through because I expect management to pull some underhanded shit and tank it. Call me paranoid, that‚Äôs fine, but I just don‚Äôt want to get my hopes up :),2021-12-30T01:52:21Z
$PQEFF what is status on Canadian market  and Frankfurt? Still have some shares on both,2021-12-29T21:43:42Z
$PQEFF When are they going to release the Haywood report?  One day before the tender deadline?  Not happy with PQEFF management&#39;s lack of communication, timelines, etc.  Take care of your shareholders PQEFF.,2021-12-29T20:28:38Z
$PQEFF how much of you would tender? I personally is going to tender.,2021-12-29T20:23:34Z
$PQEFF I reached out again to Shorecrest for an update, told them that many retails are thinking of tendering by Jan 15th if no Haywood report, my exact question was, &quot;Is the Haywood valuation coming soon? Many retail shareholders talking about tendering their shares by Jan 15th to avoid issues with their broker. Does Haywood have a hard deadline date before Jan 15?&quot;, the response I got was, &quot;We expect the recommendation to be out soon ‚Äì still no deadline date.&quot;,2021-12-29T20:12:31Z
$PQEFF call me dumb, but just say if institutional investors do not tender their shares. Would tender still go on?,2021-12-29T19:56:50Z
$PQEFF better view of holders as it shows what quarter shares were added. The aleksandr duplicate issue is a mystery tho. Did he buy more? Or did he sell a million or so shares?,2021-12-29T19:55:46Z
$PQEFF Cantone is 100% a short looking to make a quick buck.  Did a FINRA check on the guy and he&#39;s in the middle of a disclosure event where he sold muni bonds without doing proper DD and customers lost over $6.25MM. He&#39;ll likely settle for less but point remains his 27MM shares + 9MM warrants will pretty much cover his loss upon tendering,2021-12-29T19:35:48Z
$PQEFF interesting.. seeing more similarities with $RECAF. KITWE whose new position in PQEFF is 41M shares and is based out of Zambia, Africa..doing more DD will correct this information if found inaccurate,2021-12-29T17:55:04Z
$PQEFF i dont think the following sample of one Haywood valuation is representative but it may provide some insight into content and structure, format and scope of such reports. Commonality is found in that this is a TSX listed issuer. The company uplifted from TSX Venture to TSX in the few weeks following this June 3, 2020 PR.  

PR summary reveals the business focuses on reduction of emissions from internal combustion engines like diesel trucks.  High % insiders. One big outside investor.  Stock has tanked since the report. The was no TO involved.

$PQEFF Based on the Bloomberg insider holding screenshots the institutional/insider holdings increased from 176M shares to 264M shares! So there was probably manipulation for accumulation going on.

$PQEFF My prediction Haywood will put a huge evaluation. They are being paid and that‚Äôs what they do. ReconAfrica is an oil explorer in Africa. Over the last year they‚Äôve increased the evaluation from low to 12, to 16 recently. The stock trades at 5 dollars. The eval made a short bump on releases.

The stock is worth what people are willing to pay. The stock won‚Äôt reach the evaluation. I see it as leverage for a new or better deal but that‚Äôs it,2021-12-29T15:12:05Z
$PQEFF anybody check out the institutional holders today on bloomberg for Petroteq?,2021-12-29T15:01:55Z
$PQEFF BUY AND TENDER FOR EASY MONEY,2021-12-29T14:51:00Z
$PQEFF tender please,2021-12-29T14:50:27Z
$PQEFF I ordered a couch in Sept and it‚Äôs still not here because of ‚Äúcovid‚Äù.  Not sure if that‚Äôs relevant for share tendering but please don‚Äôt wait til the last minute everyone.  Give it at least a week or two of room for ‚Äúcovid‚Äù delays.  Heck look at the Haywood report, might not even get here before Feb.,2021-12-29T14:07:13Z
$PQEFF 15  days of tender.

3) able to  accurately measure present value compared with current SP

$PQEFF Daily short sale volume at ~45.4% today. Overall volume about the same as yesterday. Small ticks upward in price five trading days in a row.,2021-12-28T22:40:56Z
$PQEFF This thing keeps gapping up and retracing to fill it, very bullish sign of an imminent explosion. Thanks for whoever posted this yearly candlestick. And whoever it is that keeps saying charting patterns is not possible with OTC or low MC, please save it, I was in MRIN at $2.34, BBIG at $1.89, ANY at $2.66, SCKT at $2.67, and HMBL at $0.007. This one will be next soon enough, cherry on top with this one are the many catalysts,2021-12-28T22:23:53Z
