$PQEFF I created a new post on the Penny Stock Reddit (1.8M members) to add the oilprice.com article and some more info and numbers, https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/qs28sy/pqeff_petroteq_018_sp_with_a_059_buyout_on_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3,2021-11-12T03:28:40Z
$PQEFF The trend continued today. Slightly more overall volume. Slightly more daily short sale volume (~43.6%).,2021-11-12T01:07:31Z
$PQEFF  what I really donâ€™t understand, why someone would sell knowing that they can triple their money in 3 months ?! Any one has any ideas?,2021-11-11T23:44:45Z
$PQEFF The thing one has to know about big business, when those that hold the reins realize that something is about to change the fundamentals of their business they go absolutely bat shit crazy to stop it! Because if they can&#39;t  adopt to it and they can&#39;t change it then they become a dinosaur and no longer relevant.
My take is to follow the technology it always wins in the long run and especially in big oil. Good luck all you savy stock holders!,2021-11-11T23:41:21Z
$PQEFF No buying conviction on this stock. OilPrice.com can&#39;t pump it up. Short of some sort of haywood rabbit, seems like the tender faction will be the winner,2021-11-11T22:46:47Z
$PQEFF  Iâ€™m hoping this plays out,2021-11-11T22:30:33Z
$PQEFF I should prob check back in a month. Or only when Petro tweets something worthwhile.,2021-11-11T22:27:16Z
$PQEFF easy long hold PQEFF. 

I hope some of my Petro bros got METX in the 50s.. those days are gone now. Smart money bought $20 million worth of shares at 60 cents.. that&#39;s a lot of DD on a small stock. 5Ã—-10Ã— multiple is what they are seeking.,2021-11-11T22:13:29Z

$PQEFF this is obviously worth way more otherwise there would be no need for all the MM on this penny stock to keep it down and off certain trading exchanges,2021-11-11T20:55:35Z
$PQEFF Petroteq is strong.....,2021-11-11T20:44:15Z
$PQEFF do we think the board will dilute before valuation? ðŸ¤”,2021-11-11T20:20:46Z
$PQEFF the other thing to keep in mind, once the reserves are classified P1 proven reserves and PQE has access to 87M barrels the financing should be easy peasy lemon squeezey!,2021-11-11T20:19:48Z
$PQEFF Based on just the below valuation (and not even considering a host of other values), that puts PQEFF at $8+ per share.,2021-11-11T20:16:32Z
$PQEFF someone brought up a great point, from the article today PQE has 2500 acres under lease with access to 87,000,000 barrels of oil near surface, this oil reserves canâ€™t go on the balance sheet yet because they are not classified P1 reserves, however an analyst company such as Haywood would most likely take those reserves into their valuation, at $80 per barrel the current reserves are valued at about $7B and would last for 48 years with a single 5k BPD plant, imagine having access to $7B potential revenue already under leased land (from a patented technology) and a buyout offer of around $500M on the table? I really canâ€™t wait to see Haywoodâ€™s report and the traction that will be gained from it,2021-11-11T20:12:51Z
$PQEFF I&#39;m red alerting BTCS everywhere else so I figured I&#39;d let my QUEEF lords know my thoughts...

5 million share float, $80 million market cap with over $40 million in crypto assets plus cash on hand. Staking as a service allows them fantastic margins. Releasing a data exchange that is already in Beta and planned for release in early 2022. 52 week high of $33, ATH of $70, that microfloat can&#39;t be ignored. Keep in mind the bull run for crypto is just getting started based on on chain analysis and every variable metric we have to track. 

TKAT ran from $5 to $72 with basically no fundamentals, all on NFT hype. Their float was 12 million shares ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„.

When this company gets retail attention... Holy shit. Based on my calculations the fair value for shares is $11 right now on the low end. Personally, I&#39;m looking for the inevitable meme rally that takes this into the stratosphere. 5 million shares...,2021-11-11T18:47:48Z
$PQEFF I always hated when people did this but I have to so forgive me --&gt; when moooooooon? Rockets? 
I am just kidding I hope they gonna open TSX and let them run cause in my opinion thatÂ´s the only reason that is keeping it down. I am come on the only question here is how much money we gonna make,2021-11-11T18:25:10Z
