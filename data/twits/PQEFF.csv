$PQEFF I fear Viston is running up the stock with purchases and than in late January sell high and pull their offer.  Might be illegal to do that but not if they do it outside the company.,2021-12-31T18:17:12Z

$PQEFF so I was a little off on the timing. But for my next prediction: we will be heading straight for the 40s and 50s soon. I know I would rather sell my shares for $0.58 rather than tender at $0.59.

So the SP will be hovering up there between the people who feel the same as me vs others.,2021-12-31T16:38:19Z
