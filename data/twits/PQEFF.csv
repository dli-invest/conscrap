Profit 

GLTA regardless how it works out

Getting this TO to pay out seems the most likely path to profitable trade from here

I dont want a later 2022 or 2024 result. 
I want SP appreciation now or by February 

Any result in the same time frame that pays out as much or more is good.  

Any outcome that depresses SP for now and longer or destroys both the TO and SP is bad.,2021-11-08T05:41:25Z

$PQEFF The true buyer has yet to reveal themselves.   This is some lowball proxy bullshit offer using Viston as a front.  The real buyer doesn&#39;t want to reveal themselves otherwise if they did, shareholders would want much more for their shares.  For example, if you were selling your home, and Warren Buffett came along to buy it vs. some no name buyer, I think most of you would expect Warren to pay more just because we all know he has deep pockets.,2021-11-08T04:01:01Z
$PQEFF man this board gets me so hot.  I would make life changing money at 74 cents but based on what I am reading I should expect many multiples of that.,2021-11-08T03:29:18Z
$PQEFF I think it is a very good sign we have not heard from management.  Knee jerk reactions are not good.  Well thought out responses are great.  Have faith...there is a plan.  If there is not, well, you will know what to do based on your comfort level.  Good luck to all.  üí™üèºüçÄ,2021-11-08T02:26:00Z

$PQEFF The best real world parallel to this is Mitchell Energy and their commercialized fracking, that company was sold to Devon in 2002 for $3.1B ($4.7B in today‚Äôs dollars) almost the exact same, spent 10 years developing a tech that others said couldn‚Äôt work and proved everyone wrong and got rewarded with a $3.1B buyout (PQE equivalent fully diluted today 800M shares at $4.7B is $5.87 USD, ask Devon how that acquisition worked out for them (they still would consider it an absolute bargain if you know anything about fracking and the shale oil accessible with the tech now) now add in everybody‚Äôs favourite buzz word ‚Äúgreen‚Äù and you can see why 60 cents USD is very low  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pqfas-FXi8I,2021-11-07T23:58:28Z
$PQEFF what could anyone be possibly be nervous about?  This is a win win no matter what direction the co. decides to pursue.  They have a working model producing 500bpd using their CORT system that was 10 years in the making.I‚Äôm thinking they bring in a partner to fund expansion.  We‚Äôre in the bottom of ninth here folks.

Nuff said.  Next is boomski moonski hold and u shall seeski.,2021-11-07T23:46:53Z
$PQEFF I CAN SENSE THE NERVOUSNESS BOYS. HOLD STRONG,2021-11-07T23:36:02Z
$PQEFF anything other than dilution and I think the sp increases. Either they have a plan, jv, funding, license etc or they don‚Äôt have anything and people decide to tender.

They‚Äôve had a week to work out how not to fuck themselves. They should have something concrete to show they can make it on their own,2021-11-07T23:31:52Z

$PQEFF when bailey drops PR he&#39;s not playing. He wouldn&#39;t encourage us to invest and then crap on us.

Unlocking global mineral heavy oil deposits means Petroteq will be unlocking a lot of shareholder value through selling licenses and producing their own oil. I look forward to BOD response to buyout offer.. current offer already lets you know PQ valuable now and has a big future ahead.,2021-11-07T19:19:08Z
$PQEFF Esoteric tweet interpretation bros: tomorrow we will be vindicated when Petroteq releases news of licensing and partnerships.  Poor lushmeadow will be left chasing as the stock climbs past a dollar.  To each their own I suppose‚Ä¶,2021-11-07T18:43:00Z
$PQEFF weird how the tweet links to a page with Blyumkin still listed as CEO with pic.,2021-11-07T17:29:32Z
$PQEFF bruh these tweets üòÇ,2021-11-07T16:39:40Z
$PQEFF I also think not responding immediately to the buyout means that something is brewing, I have a feeling we will all be pleasantly surprised, maybe not tomorrow but over the coming weeks/months. Either licensing agreements or another oil player. I think the $0.74C offer will look really cheap soon,2021-11-07T16:00:48Z
$PQEFF I think the new tweet seems to indicate that they have licenses lined up, and are focusing on their operations and not on the buyout. So I believe their response tomorrow will say they‚Äôre not interested in the deal.,2021-11-07T15:54:10Z

The Big companies can see it yet most retail investors still don&#39;t realize how early it is. The Latest Paul Thomas video where he called it at a  very cheap price a few weeks ago

$PQEFF lol. another dumb tweet. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,2021-11-07T15:20:12Z
$PQEFF here‚Äôs my optimistic view, considering bailey‚Äôs connections to big oil: ‚Äúwe recommend against tendering shares at the current buyout price. We have obtained independent valuation of this technology and believe the fair market value to be far above the offer price. Additionally, we have explored other avenues and have identified and contacted other companies who agree with our assessment. As such, we have signed an NDA and entered into discussions with a major oil company regarding our revolutionary CORT technology.‚Äù That would‚Äôve been a good use of the last two weeks, no?,2021-11-07T14:42:43Z
$DPLS Are you looking for access to an infrastructure play with insane future potential with ground breaking tech? Look no further

$GXXM Are you looking for exposure to the DeFi space as institutions and banks begin trading and holding crypto? Look no further

$VSQTF Are you looking for exposure to the Metaverse with real companies that do actual business with blockchain, AR/VR, and the creator space? Look no further. 

$PQEFF Are you looking for exposure to a revolutionary tech with a buy out offer of 74 cents per share on the table? Look no further.

Novemeber and December are going to be wild.,2021-11-07T14:35:36Z
$PQEFF Our dear beloved investors, we have waited until the last day to inform you that we do not recommend accepting this 3x offer of current share price, because we think it undervalues the potential of this technology thet we dont have experience and plan to develop. P.s. Ww will issue 2m shares when the price will fall to 0.12 usd again. Thank you for trusting us,2021-11-07T12:31:05Z

$PQEFF How much of the company is owned by whales, insiders and institutions? Thus, how much will the individual retail investor&#39;s preferences or opinions matter and factor into this takeover drama? Who are the players?,2021-11-07T07:56:19Z
