$PQEFF Do the shorts actually get anywhere shorting this on low volume? Admittedly a bit confused.

Have a good weekend, all!,2022-02-04T22:41:48Z
$PQEFF Have an exceptional weekend everyone! Cheers üçª,2022-02-04T22:38:31Z
$PQEFF what would a $500k purchase do to SP? Very tempted right now,2022-02-04T21:58:40Z
$PQEFF The waiting period for the HSR filing expires today, and the ICA filing should have been completed yesterday.  maybe we‚Äôll get news about this next week.,2022-02-04T21:17:46Z

$PQEFF Yesterday Kingsdale called me (I didn&#39;t answer that call, but was left a message)and today Viston also called. Viston did confirm my amount of shares tendered( Their total for what I had was off) If you get a call on your phone that says spam risk from Toronto it&#39;s probably from either of them.,2022-02-04T15:07:14Z
$PQEFF For any of you considering Tomco Energy as a home for some of the PQE proceeds, (if/when we eventually get them!), here is some DD information to get your teeth into;

Tomco have of course already secured licences for multi site use of the PQE CORT technology. IMO a very low M&#39;Cap company with huge potential.

$PQEFF Here is the OFFICIAL EXTENSION DOCUMENT from Viston

It&#39;s actually fairly easy to understand...,2022-02-04T03:57:02Z
$OODH just like $PQEFF but that one already ran 1200% for me from .03 $MDMP,2022-02-04T01:58:23Z
$AABB to recoup losses buy $PQEFF and tender your shares for 50% profit!!,2022-02-03T23:45:32Z
$PQEFF if your with TD just call one of their brokers. Tender takes 5 minutes.,2022-02-03T23:30:44Z
$PQEFF  I&#39;m wondering if the low volume is indicative of most of the floating shares having been tendered, since the extension didn&#39;t occur until the 11th hour so to speak.... or if its just and unwillingness on the part of buyers  to move the price higher and sellers to let go of their shares lower....   I guess we&#39;ll see which if the volume picks up and share price remains static.

I&#39;d expect if volume picks up and most of the float has been tendered... the share price should make wide fluctuations on any bump at all.,2022-02-03T22:58:09Z
$PQEFF  I got an email from Schwab about them extending the tender offer to Feb. 25th, 2022 now.  Anyone else get an e-mail about the extension?,2022-02-03T21:24:55Z
$PQEFF tendered again. The newly tendered share number get smaller and smaller, but I keep buying bits and tendering. I keep telling myself I‚Äôll stop, but‚Ä¶now 50k shares tendered. I know‚Ä¶not a huge position‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm good with that. It‚Äôs still money.,2022-02-03T20:10:10Z
$PQEFF Not the timeline we wanted, but the timeline we have. Til then.....,2022-02-03T18:52:32Z
$PQEFF The only reason to not tender would be to chase the small chance of price reaching more than $0.59 before the offer expires and then selling at a price above the offer, right?,2022-02-03T18:33:04Z
$PQEFF and $RECAF are only green today,2022-02-03T17:54:31Z
$PQEFF Got an email back from kingsdale, I had it confirmed that most brokers usually wait 24 hours prior to expiry to send in tender instructions so these are unknown numbers to viston and were not included in the 144 mil count. 
Also said it‚Äôs likely they will give updates as regulatory filings and assessment periods are resolved which was the reason for the extension, not because of the share count.    
just have to chill and keep waiting lads.,2022-02-03T17:53:45Z
$PQEFF will they move the goal posts again on this tender date I wonder,2022-02-03T17:50:41Z

$PQEFF give me 1 reason why anyone would intentionally NOT tender?,2022-02-03T17:19:59Z
$PQEFF Is there a risk of the price moving back above 40 cents and too many people deciding to sell instead of tendering? Or will the new buyers likely tender?,2022-02-03T17:01:02Z
$PQEFF Sitting at 130 million shares reported as yes plus 145m paper shares.,2022-02-03T16:23:04Z
$PQEFF love the volume!!,2022-02-03T15:53:42Z
