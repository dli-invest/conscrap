$PQEFF Konstantinek1  has lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in OTC stocks. This guy is a very dangerous green and deep purple glistening wasp in the bright sunlight seeking out anyone to sting and utterly kill after losing thousands upon thousands of dollars.,2021-12-14T01:08:47Z
$PQEFF like this post if you Muted MITKinvestor , let‚Äôs see how many of us can‚Äôt stand the negative BS üòÇ,2021-12-14T00:48:16Z
$PQEFF MITKInvestor is a mindless schill that is 38 cents short upstairs. MUTED.,2021-12-13T23:54:11Z
$PQEFF I believe Viston will sweeten the offer to 1.50 Canadian before February 7th.,2021-12-13T23:52:44Z

$PQEFF 71,042 shares added right before close. Better in than out (especially at these prices) not going to squabble over less than half a cent.,2021-12-13T21:11:29Z
$PQEFF That MITKInvestor dude is one of the BIGGEST tools I have seen on any board. He also has a couple buddies that will bash you if you write anything negative about him. He&#39;s the reason I don&#39;t come here anymore for a little bit of conversation every now and then, every single thing he writes it toxic, and usually wrong and with no supporting facts, ever. I&#39;ll see all you PQE guys on the other side, Petroteq Strong!!!,2021-12-13T20:53:04Z

With that offer already on the table, this really does fall under the millionaire maker category. How is the market so blind to this?

$PQEFF  I wonder if MITKInvestor sold his shares then posts &quot;Tank City! the deal appears to be falling apart&quot; with no proof (kinda like yelling &quot;fire&quot;) so that he can buy back at a lower price.,2021-12-13T18:43:57Z

$PQEFF IF TSX halt is lifted where does the price go...,2021-12-13T17:56:30Z
$PQEFF,2021-12-13T17:31:44Z
$PQEFF if this is still halted on the TSX then why am I able to buy shares still?,2021-12-13T17:27:02Z
$PQEFF diligence is a patient process.. investor meetings take time.. interested investors will want to meet at multiple sites. 

More time for TSX halt to get lifted and add liquidity to market.

Looking forward to an honest valuation and financial report from Haywood.,2021-12-13T17:04:22Z

$PQEFF FWIW, I contacted Petroteq to ask what was the outstanding reason for the halt and when we might expect the result of their strategic review, post Haywood report. I received the following reply;

&quot;Thank you for your inquiry.  Petroteq Energy Inc and their legal counsel are working hard with the exchange to resolve the issues for the trading halt and to have it lifted, but any communication between the two parties is confidential. Petroteq will provide an update on their progress as soon as they are able to.

 During the strategic review, any information that has not already been released to the public is considered part of the strategic review.  The review should be complete in the next couple of weeks and an updated recommendation regarding the Viston offer provided to shareholders. We will email you a copy of the updated recommendation as soon as it is available.&quot;

Looks like we might have a detailed report to muse over during the Xmas holidays??,2021-12-13T11:06:04Z

So..  Do we think the halt will last til 2022?,2021-12-13T10:59:20Z
$PQEFF looking forward to the Haywood report and valuation.  Viston offer is only going to get better...,2021-12-13T03:58:33Z
$PQEFF there are legally only 2 scenarios for Viston to shorten the deal expiry date, from the Petroteq Offer document, ‚ÄúThe initial deposit period under the Offer may be shortened in the following circumstances, subject to a minimum deposit period of at least the later of 35 days following the date of the Offer or 20 business days following the date of the Offer: (i) if Petroteq issues a deposit period news release in respect of either the Offer or another offeror‚Äôs take-over bid that is less than 105 days, the Offeror may vary the terms of the Offer to shorten the initial deposit period to at least the number of days from the date of the Offer as stated in the deposit period news release; or (ii) if Petroteq issues a news release announcing that it has agreed to enter into, or determined to effect, an Alternative Transaction, the Offeror may vary the terms of the Offer to shorten the initial deposit period‚Äù doesn‚Äôt matter if 90% of shareholders tender today the date won‚Äôt move,2021-12-13T03:54:03Z
$PQEFF Here&#39;s the deal guys. I just talked with a Charles Schwab broker ( my account is with Charles Schwab). He told me everything is legit. Right now the offer is .74 Canadian or, .58 US dollar. We are not guaranteed that the offer will still be at .74 Canadian by February 7, 2022. It could be sweetened, lessened or abandoned. If enough of us tendered now to where it was 50% or more of the stock tendered, we would get the .58 now. That is what I understand. If not, then we are subject to a sweetened offer, lessened offer or abandoned offer by February 7, 2022. You decide. I tendered tonight through Schwab.,2021-12-13T03:03:14Z
