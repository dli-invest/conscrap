$PQEFF does tendering mean we are locking our shares into be bought at the offer price in the event the deal goes through feb 22 and you forego right to sell before the deadline date?,2021-11-19T05:11:36Z

$VSQTF Amazing coverage... Finally someone that gets it. 94 cents of assets on the book for every $1 you invest... And that&#39;s not even with the up to date financials coming at the end of the month ðŸ’µðŸ”¥. For those that don&#39;t know 94 cents of assets per dollar is better than Blackrock by almost 300% and better than Berkshire Hathaway ðŸ™„. How many penny stocks do you know of with 6 consecutive quarters of positive EPS? How many do you know that pay share dividends of their spin off companies? The next 90 days they are paying out the second share dividend of Immersive, launching an Alt Coin ETF, spinning off Stardust solar, and then taking Co pilot public for a value of $150-$300 million.

I can lead the horse to water, but I can&#39;t make him drink.

$BABA 

Please go up!

Too much punishment for such a big company.

Today I bought 200 more just to average down and because I have a strong confidence on BABA!

$PQEFF Please take a minute to do this anonymous survey and share with other investors I am considering doing a full DD on Petroteq, their technology and the hostile takeover offer. The idea here is to give all of us a good idea of where we stand.

I currently have a bit over 500k shares and am considering do a full DD and making a large share purchase.

Thank you,

PennyQueen

$PQEFF Took another look at the PR re convertible notes transactions.  The exchange seems to be taking issue with the conversion prices being too low, but I found a TSXV policy which allows a reduction of the min pricing requirements as a temporary COVID-19 relief  measure.  Now I&#39;m not even sure the company has done anything wrong.

Check out the temp pricing relief bulletins:

$PQEFF Looking at the sp movement the last week or so, I think this is the floor. 

Everyone in is okay with waiting, which means low downside and high upside from here. The next catalyst is the Haywood report, which imo can only be positive. They are a paid reporter, which means a high sp target with positive outlook on company. Iâ€™m guessing the report will be out by December/early December to allow time for negotiations with other companies

I predict share price increasing slightly over the next 30 days with hopefully an increase in bid amount. Then a larger increase of sp in January to around .30-.40 us. 

I personally donâ€™t see another bidder, hopefully Iâ€™m wrong. If there was another bidder they would approached the company already. 

My plan is to tender no matter what in late January (Unless a miracle from the co. with imminent large profits).,2021-11-18T18:34:46Z

$PQEFF If you don&#39;t understand the significance of the TomCo interview and why they are drilling conventional oil wells I think it is because of oil reserves. Conventional oilwell technology is very well known and if they do the exploration work work and geology surveys they will get proven reserves classification right away which will give them instant access to financing. In the case of the oil sands portion that FEED results just recently confirmed the technology so I believe PQE has to apply to a US department in charge of oil reserves classifcation which they probably did when they got the FEED results, since it is a new technology it will take some time for the US department to classify the reserves as P1 or P2 which in turn allows PQE (and by extension TomCo) to finance the building of the plant in very favorable terms. In PQE&#39;s case there are 80M barrels of accessible oil (at $80 per barrel that reserve would be $6.4B worth) easy plant financing after that happens.,2021-11-18T17:09:00Z

$PQEFF got a message from fidelity this morning for the offering. It says itâ€™s from Ontario inc? Is that who viston is going through? Offer is to purchase my shares for $0.59 per share. Iâ€™m holding. Thatâ€™s too cheap for this technology.,2021-11-18T16:09:02Z

$PQEFF I did email investor relations as well of 10 large oil companies and I didnâ€™t get any responses other than chevron that they opened a ticket up and will investigate, but maybe someone will counter the offer Iâ€™m hoping?,2021-11-18T15:30:45Z
$PQEFF well I bought a little more, every 2 weeks after I get paid Iâ€™ll keep buying a few hundred dollars worth at these prices, up to 320k shares so Iâ€™ll be very happy if it gets to $0.60 or a higher offer, just have to sit around and wait. Looking forward to the New Year, anyone think a deal might happen before than?,2021-11-18T15:28:36Z
