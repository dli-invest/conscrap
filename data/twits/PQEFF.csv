$PQEFF looking forward to the Haywood report and valuation.  Viston offer is only going to get better...,2021-12-13T03:58:33Z
$PQEFF there are legally only 2 scenarios for Viston to shorten the deal expiry date, from the Petroteq Offer document, ‚ÄúThe initial deposit period under the Offer may be shortened in the following circumstances, subject to a minimum deposit period of at least the later of 35 days following the date of the Offer or 20 business days following the date of the Offer: (i) if Petroteq issues a deposit period news release in respect of either the Offer or another offeror‚Äôs take-over bid that is less than 105 days, the Offeror may vary the terms of the Offer to shorten the initial deposit period to at least the number of days from the date of the Offer as stated in the deposit period news release; or (ii) if Petroteq issues a news release announcing that it has agreed to enter into, or determined to effect, an Alternative Transaction, the Offeror may vary the terms of the Offer to shorten the initial deposit period‚Äù doesn‚Äôt matter if 90% of shareholders tender today the date won‚Äôt move,2021-12-13T03:54:03Z
$PQEFF Here&#39;s the deal guys. I just talked with a Charles Schwab broker ( my account is with Charles Schwab). He told me everything is legit. Right now the offer is .74 Canadian or, .58 US dollar. We are not guaranteed that the offer will still be at .74 Canadian by February 7, 2022. It could be sweetened, lessened or abandoned. If enough of us tendered now to where it was 50% or more of the stock tendered, we would get the .58 now. That is what I understand. If not, then we are subject to a sweetened offer, lessened offer or abandoned offer by February 7, 2022. You decide. I tendered tonight through Schwab.,2021-12-13T03:03:14Z
$PQEFF so there is an offer on the table for about 300 million us and share price is selling at 0.13 us about 500 million shares so 65 million market cap us. Sorry for Canadian conversion confusion, but why?,2021-12-13T02:16:26Z
$PQEFF worth taking a look

With that offer on the table, this really does fall under the millionaire maker category. How is the market blind to this?

$PQEFF seems too good to be true. Buy now and get 5x return if they accept the offer?,2021-12-12T18:28:20Z
$PQEFF I&#39;m tendering my 10k shares, I need money good luck to all!,2021-12-12T17:06:07Z
$PQEFF the only ones pressuring you to sell or tender are bears, shorts and people down a lot of money. Those aren&#39;t the people who you want to listen to. If you don&#39;t trust management, you shouldn&#39;t be invested. 

I&#39;m trusting management and Haywood and relaxing. There are a lot of catalysts out there.  Petroteq is looking for a financially superior option and they said PR soon.  Dr Bailey doesn&#39;t mess around when he starts dropping PR. Do what&#39;s best for you. Stocks are volatile and buy in doses.,2021-12-12T16:33:29Z
$PQEFF I‚Äôm seeing a lot of back and forth between parties so let‚Äôs make a deal.  If by Jan 7th we haven‚Äôt heard anything or we did hear something but it didn‚Äôt move the stock one bit we all tender.  It‚Äôs not going to reduce our negotiation power since we have none at that point.   That‚Äôs gives us one month for paperwork mistakes, slow mail, covid delays etc.  All agree?,2021-12-12T15:22:28Z
$PQEFF tender so I can pay my tax bill please. I need 4k from my 1k investment 
dont be selfish people 
tender. 
i am in need,2021-12-12T14:24:31Z

 consider tendering your shares. 100% guaranteed money now, is better than, 0% guaranteed money in the future.&quot;

Except of course tendering now guarantees nothing but merely strengthens Viston&#39;s hand in any potential future negotiations.

We know who you are working for Barethoughts, either that or you haven&#39;t a clue about the offer details, or both!!,2021-12-12T12:30:27Z

$PQEFF reasons for not tendering yet..

Haywood valuation coming soon

Haywood report

Competing buyout offers

JV deals

Additional contracts and royalties 

TSX halt getting lifted....

No rush to tender. especially from folks that are trying to scare  you. Be smart and invest in doses and amounts you&#39;re comfortable with.,2021-12-11T23:24:52Z

$PQEFF bears working this hard on weekends is an amazing buying indicator.. we&#39;re near a bottom.. buy in doses and be smart.,2021-12-11T15:15:46Z
$PQEFF Have a look at a company Acceleware (AXE) to see how government funding can help build a plant like PQE (AXE has a different technology for oil sands but is a good example of how governments would help fund GHG reducing technology in Canada) excerpt from last news release, ‚Äú As of September 30, 2021, total direct funding committed to the RF XL Pilot included $5 million from Alberta Innovates, $5.5 million from Sustainable Development Technology Canada (‚ÄúSDTC‚Äù), $5 million from Emissions Reduction Alberta (‚ÄúERA‚Äù), and $6 million from three major oil sands producers.‚Äù,2021-12-11T14:16:05Z
$PQEFF Why spend all that cash without at least trying PQE‚Äôs tech? https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/how-much-suncor-and-its-peers-need-to-spend-to-hit-net-zero-142908058.html,2021-12-11T13:54:12Z
$PQEFF The FUD on this board is through the roof. The offer is real with confirmation of financing, filing with the SEC and major brokerages sending notifications on how to tender. There are three logical outcomes to this after the Haywood valuation: petroteq advises to accept the offer from Viston, they secure a better offer from Viston or a 3rd party, or they say don‚Äôt sell and announce a plan for financing their 2 5k bbd plants. There is a 4th unlikely outcome in which they say don‚Äôt tender but have no plan‚Ä¶ with as few shares as the board holds, how many of you bears think others won‚Äôt tender? 

Now let‚Äôs start reading tea leaves. They‚Äôre dismantling their test plant next year and have replaced 2 directors with a part time guy and a gave another one 2 roles. Does this sound like a company that plans to be operating long term or maybe one that is working on a deal?,2021-12-11T13:27:34Z
$PQEFF what‚Äôs the plan gents?,2021-12-11T12:51:18Z

$PQEFF Just for the record, I am still holding shares, but we all know that the situation is on the weird side of things.,2021-12-11T10:44:09Z
$PQEFF This has probably been mentioned already (I have been away from this board for a while), but this is the building that Viston gives as its address. Even if it&#39;s just a holding or a shell company, you&#39;d expect something else, wouldn&#39;t you?,2021-12-11T10:13:42Z
$PQEFF  Please understand that many of the accounts contributing to the echo chamber here and on Reddit have very, very young account ages with no comments on any other subreddits or threads. They come and go mentioning how many shares they have &quot;bought today&quot; to convince retail investors that there are still interested buyers and demand. 
 
As far as I know, Bellridge Capital invested first on May 5th, 2021, conveniently just before the German offer went public. Now, IMO, Bellridge has realized it has fleeced shareholders as much as it can and is now exiting its position at a nearly 100% profit in half a year.  
 
I have suspicions that Klimov, MP at Bellridge, has associations with Zbigniew Roch, and they colluded to jack this share price up.  
 
If this is so certain, why oh why is the stock trading at this valuation given the &quot;offer&quot;.  
 
Make your own decision, keep your position if you want, but do not be drowned out by a few very vocal but likely fake bulls.,2021-12-11T09:42:28Z
