$CWSFF For anyone here considering $PQEFF as a way to recoup losses here, it&#39;s nice to be on the right side of a SA piece for a change.  Dropped tonight:

$FWBI risk/reward seems good here, I&#39;m in. Also liking $PQEFF as an undervalued ESG/Energy/Tech play with near-term catalysts. $LEV in the EV space. $ASTS as a stealth govt/defense play with a huge market for its &quot;official&quot; product. $LUXFF still the best value BTC miner.,2021-10-22T22:24:22Z

$PQEFF Are we EVER going to get unhalted in Canada? At this point i&#39;m really leaning towards the &quot;conspiracy&quot; theory that it&#39;s being held back so the potential buyer can have better leverage. 

Idk, I&#39;m usually not a conspiracy theorist but something&#39;s got to give at this point.,2021-10-22T21:36:08Z

$PQEFF Not bad considering the blood bath in the OTC market,2021-10-22T20:35:11Z
$PQEFF If we want to talk about ridiculous but possible number - Suncor in 2020 recorded $10.5B (average oil price was $40 per barrel) revenue from Oil Sands but due to price of operation and low oil prices last year they actually had a net loss from Oil Sands of $5B, now imagine if they used PQE&#39;s technology and reduced their cost down to $22 per barrel and sold the sand for $10 per barrel, ask yourself how much this tech would be worth to Suncor? Now if PQE signs a license agreement with Suncor and after several years their total oil sands production was through PQE license agreement with a 5% royalty (I believe it would be on Net not Gross revenue but still with $80 oil the $10.5B would be $21B with a net revenue of probably $10B time 5% royalty is ..... $500 Million PER YEAR!!! that is one of the top 5 oil sands producers in Canada only. Expand this around the world and within 5 years this could be easily a $10B company ($16.66 SP) on royalties alone, someone check my math please,2021-10-22T20:11:21Z
$PQEFF oh yeah there&#39;s very few sellers left! very few buyers right now too though! lol that&#39;s okay  we&#39;re holding out for the big moves when the world finally sees this gem!,2021-10-22T20:05:07Z

$PQEFF www.petroteq.com will still be great the next 12 months.. relax.

Guys who know I&#39;m legit and try to make you money. Here is my other big play JP. Bought it last Nov at 1.60 and sold in February for 3.00.

I bought 49,500 shares today. CEO and insiders own over 50% of company, so major skin in the game.  Low float NYSE 30,000,000 OS. Company recently announced 10,000,000 share buyback.

We love low float, closely held by insiders. With buyback.,2021-10-22T19:00:01Z
$PQEFF is this ask size legit?,2021-10-22T18:29:52Z
$PQEFF Anyone wondering whether or not they should pull the trigger on this dip, consider this: it&#39;s extremely likely we&#39;re weeks, if not days, from a hostile takeover (the board won&#39;t accept 60 cents, that&#39;s the reality of it).  The announcement of the hostile takeover attempt will almost immediately jump this stock near the offer price.  You&#39;re talking about 4-5x the current price in a matter of weeks,2021-10-22T18:20:47Z
$PQEFF the market is a scam üòÇ,2021-10-22T18:11:47Z

$PQEFF $igac $dwac $phun $BENE man the market has turned into a totally overt pump and dump scheme that everyone is in on. so wild lol this is probably the death blow to the world economy. get rich while you can and buy a big property and homestead so you survive what&#39;s coming.,2021-10-22T18:00:22Z

$PQEFF barely any money in or out of here today. these moves are as trivial as they get. the thin walls on the way up will get smashed so fast the second we get news.,2021-10-22T16:59:43Z
$PQEFF bad day in market, holding strong,2021-10-22T16:52:07Z
