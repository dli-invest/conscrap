$PQEFF I see a lot of people worried about SP atm. The whole market was red this week, not just this one.  This one actually held up pretty good considering the week the market just had. Next week will most likely be even bloodier.,2021-12-04T04:24:02Z
$PQEFF Here is my opinion:It‚Äôs always darkest before the dawn. Try to ignore the noise and negativity until mid January. If someone was trying to bring the price down and create fear and panic selling they are succeeding right now, we know the Haywood report is coming and we know that the board recommendation is coming after that (which may be the board saying to accept the offer). Tendering now does not help anything but if you feel you want to tender then by all means go ahead but it will not prevent Viston from pulling the offer if that is what they want to do, they could have 90% of shares tendered in January and still pull the offer, people are grasping at ways to gain control of a situation that is beyond our control and if tendering prevents you from selling your shares at under 20 cents then tendering is way better than not tendering in my opinion, but if you can wait it out until after the Haywood report at least you will have more information to make your decision.,2021-12-04T03:48:11Z
$PQEFF What morons are selling?,2021-12-04T03:18:59Z
$PQEFF @draincleaner 
Looks like you win the SP pool 0.135 maybe next

Added here and $AUNXF this week,2021-12-04T03:16:25Z
$PQEFF reading the news on the new licensee. So pqeff is essentially giving away it&#39;s technology to Big Sky Resources  for $2 million or for free, and 5% royalty. What is wrong with this management? What is this crap? Freaking terrible. There was a very good buyout offer on the table and it will go away now, no wonder my long went from +130% to flat. I&#39;ll be dumping my bag of shares on Monday, good luck everyone,2021-12-04T01:39:18Z
$PQEFF Daily short sale volume at around 40% yesterday, 29.3% today. A bit of a volume increase on the price drops. Buying again on Wednesday next week. Have a great weekend, all!,2021-12-03T23:22:49Z
$PQEFF there&#39;s just too many shares floating to stop the sale.  Valkor is a big owner along with bellridge but they alone cannot stop the takeover.,2021-12-03T22:51:03Z
$PQEFF It seems people are still uncertain whether the offer will go through which is fair I suppose. I for one hold a certain amount of uncertainty as well. However as the days go on I am more convinced that the deal will go through unless there is some huge change that occurs between now and February.,2021-12-03T21:52:54Z
$PQEFF Here&#39;s an easy test to see if you&#39;re aware of what&#39;s going on: do you think Viston is excited or nervous about this huge dip?,2021-12-03T21:12:29Z
$PQEFF sure seems like all the big share count holders on here have already tendered‚Ä¶.,2021-12-03T20:59:51Z
$PQEFF what are the odds of the tender going thru? Seems like an easy 4x if it&#39;s going to tender,2021-12-03T20:49:35Z
$PQEFF who here still buying while planning on tendering in January? üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,2021-12-03T20:47:25Z
$PQEFF Something a lot of people on here don&#39;t understand: Viston doesn&#39;t want the stock.  They&#39;re not concerned about the SP, or flipping the shares for more, etc.  They want the technology.  Period.,2021-12-03T20:34:58Z
$PQEFF I&#39;m gonna die of laughter when all these guys with small share counts crying out to be greedy and hold out for more lose all liquidity when the deal goes thru and the company becomes private.,2021-12-03T20:04:22Z
$PQEFF To tender or not to tender, that is the question!,2021-12-03T19:49:14Z
$PQEFF if you are worried about people not tendering buy more shares so you can tender them yourself.,2021-12-03T19:42:51Z
$PQEFF I understand folks argument to hold out on tendering in hopes Viston will up their offer and the whole ‚Äúnobody leads with their best offer‚Äù stance, but that only works if investors have a reason not to tender. The current price action isn‚Äôt conducive to that at all, and I seriously doubt Viston feels any pressure at all to raise their offer. I‚Äôll hold for another week or two waiting for the Haywood, but I have extremely little faith that some major catalyst is coming that will surpass the Viston offer. Anyone else considering tendering soon so Viston know not all of retail is delusional? You can always withdraw if the Haywood report is a banger.,2021-12-03T19:30:26Z
$PQEFF at this rate the stock will be at the price prior to the offer,2021-12-03T19:21:53Z

$PQEFF have a good weekend,2021-12-03T17:08:41Z
$PQEFF bought more... Just shy of 200k ... Happy Friday all,2021-12-03T16:15:00Z
$PQEFF watching everyone disagree while I wait for January like:,2021-12-03T15:59:08Z
$PQEFF Stop caring. That‚Äôs literally all you have to do. Just imagine this pepe everytime bears spread fear, uncertainty, doubt etc.  One way or another Petroteq is going up, buy, hold and wait my friends‚Ä¶,2021-12-03T15:35:53Z
$PQEFF eliminate the noise, only positive vibes here. Cheers,2021-12-03T15:14:23Z
$PQEFF Whole market is down, for the love of God, I&#39;ll wait it out...,2021-12-03T15:14:09Z
$PQEFF Bailey bought over a million shares at 0.12 in July. You think he&#39;s selling now?,2021-12-03T15:12:04Z
$PQEFF I encourage everyone to re-read this sentence from Purus over and over: &quot;So your super rich payoff will be a couple, if not several, years down the road.&quot;  This sentence right here is everything you need to know abot people who get rich in the market and people who don&#39;t

And since this keeps going over the heads of several folks in here, I&#39;ll repeat: if it&#39;s the end of January and Petroteq has nothing?  I&#39;ll tender like everyone else.  But I&#39;m not scared of what happens if the buyout doesn&#39;t go through.  I know some of you think you can read minds, but you can&#39;t, so you&#39;ll have to take my word on that.,2021-12-03T15:07:06Z
$PQEFF Why the *uck is this thing bleeding out with an offer on the table.  Should have stabilized over .20 and slowly crept UPWARDS if anything.  More *ucking garbage.,2021-12-03T15:04:35Z
$PQEFF   PQEMillions wrote: &quot;I wouldn&#39;t feel sad at all if they withdrew the offer tomorrow because I didn&#39;t buy one of my 1.2 million shares AFTER the offer was made.&quot;    I&#39;m not buying that.  Here is why - simple money math.   Let&#39;s estimate that you bought at about $0.05/share so the buyout would give you 10x payoff in two months - 10x (900%) payoffs are rare!   You could take that profit and invest in other hopefully profitable companies.   If the offer is pulled, the SP would sink to probably under $0.10/share and for PQEFF to make you &quot;super rich&quot;  you are going to bide your time for PQEFF to build numerous plants.   I don&#39;t think there will be one fully operational 5K or 10K barrels/day plant running by the end of next year so your &#39;super rich&#39; payoff will be a couple if not several years down the road.   A bird in the hand... make that 10 birds in the hand in 2 months vs an unknown number of years in the bush.   You should be on your knees praying for the sale to go through.,2021-12-03T15:01:05Z
$PQEFF FWIW, I just bought an extra 38k shares at 15.40 cents.  
I&#39;m a bargain shopper I guess,2021-12-03T14:58:21Z
