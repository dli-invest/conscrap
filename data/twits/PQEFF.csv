$PQEFF I&#39;m happy the word has gotten out and all, but my god are there some pretty clueless people cluttering up this board lately,2021-11-03T05:40:29Z
$PQEFF  novice question here , what happens to your shares if you do not tender and they get there 50 % plus 1, I want to hold long term just asking because I don‚Äôt know  and don‚Äôt want to tender .
Thanks,2021-11-03T00:41:34Z
$PQEFF dude you don‚Äôt have a clue.  GL,2021-11-03T00:28:34Z
$PQEFF gets this down to 10 cents and everyone will be tendering their shares IMO. Petroteq BOD better be working a lot of late hours! Known this was coming for months. U gotta know they already had a plan of action! ü§î,2021-11-02T23:35:38Z
$PQEFF JUST BOUGHT 5K SHARES AT .183 TODAY. I DECIDED THIS IS A WIN/WIN SITUATION. A NO BRAINER FOR A MINIMUM OF A 300% GAIN. COULD BE MUCH HIGHER WITH A BIDDING WAR. GLTA.,2021-11-02T22:35:58Z
$PQEFF A lot of the same the last three trading days. Shorts largely not the problem.,2021-11-02T22:05:32Z
$PQEFF It may take a few years but this is a $5.00 to $10.00 stock.  I can wait it out.,2021-11-02T21:55:54Z
$PQEFF obviously someone wants those shares if they start paying shills .... think about it ... as for me i know the offer is there but waiting for the end game ...,2021-11-02T21:38:40Z
$PQEFF tender your shares!!!,2021-11-02T21:26:20Z

$PQEFF email investors@petroteq.energy no to poison pill,2021-11-02T21:05:32Z
$PQEFF if Petroteq stays in this price range, everyone will tender in a few months.

If Petroteq unlocks more value and increases share price, that is even better for shareholders and buyout discussions. 

There are other potential bidders and deals that can come to table the next 90 days. It&#39;s  all bullish..

Buyer will increase share price if buyout doesn&#39;t go through or buy shares on open market.  They want Petroteq bad.,2021-11-02T21:03:22Z
$PQEFF I love it when @AwwYeahh shows up in the chat. Finally, a little sanity amongst the masses!! Another thing, yes, saying to the bidder, here&#39;s all the shares three months early really will put pressure on them.....NOT. And finally, after that obvious shill post to tender, I must block now....and mute!,2021-11-02T20:57:11Z
$PQEFF  gap up to 0.40 on Thursday. Buy big tomorrow. You heard it here first,2021-11-02T20:45:10Z
$PQEFF 
Can‚Äôt be that difficult to understand.

To put the bidder, the company, potential other buyers and short guys under pressure we all need to tender!

We can withdraw anytime,2021-11-02T20:40:04Z
$PQEFF  I am not sure why people are selling at this point ? Mind boggling!,2021-11-02T20:38:54Z
$PQEFF I‚Äôm just sitting back watching and thinking, ‚Äúwhen Lambo‚Äù?,2021-11-02T20:37:12Z
$PQEFF Everybody chill out.
Bottom line is: This a proven game changing technology, with the high likelihood of progressively increasing demand as this world is into global warming issue big time. All we need is a discreet future plan from BOD and then some more time for it to realize it‚Äôs full potential. Patience is the name of the game. If you have no patience, then tender your shares and sit tight for next 3 months. If you are little bit savvy, you won‚Äôt tender them as yet. Why would Viston offer 4X the price to begin with? They know that they could recoup that money with in a year or so and then huge profits year after year. Profits are going to multiply quickly. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Think before you take your seat belts off and quit. Good luck to all.,2021-11-02T20:34:16Z
$PQEFF So tender then Satori, who&#39;s stopping you?? Tender a bunch so the price goes up now to two bucks, then I can sell...,2021-11-02T20:31:41Z
$PQEFF 
Hold or tender is the same at this point.
Only when we tender, the number of shares in the system for lending/short will be less and the price goes up for sure.

Anyone saying different doesn‚Äôt understand the situation,2021-11-02T20:29:57Z
$PQEFF If you tender your shares, it doesn&#39;t affect the stock price one bit, except you can&#39;t sell them. That last post by the shilltori, I mean satori, doesn&#39;t make any sense. Your shares get put into a depository.......how does that make the price go up?? Wishful thinking???,2021-11-02T20:28:16Z
$PQEFF They first tried concern trolls, but that was quickly sniffed out.  Now, they&#39;re sending people on here, tagging &quot;bullish&quot;, telling you the best move is hand over your shares to Viston

Do you see how badly they want what you have?,2021-11-02T20:24:36Z
$PQEFF @the_satori is clearly a paid shill.  Four posts in 30 minutes telling you the best move is to tender your shares.  What have I been telling you since last week?  Viston is so desperate to get your shares they are SENDING PAID TROLLS TO THESE BOARDS!

Why do you think they&#39;re that desperate to get their hands on this?,2021-11-02T20:22:23Z
$PQEFF 
Guys ask your Broker/Dealer!
When we tender, the price will go up, close to tender price.
It‚Äôs our best chance to get a higher price, also the shares will not be available for lending.
We can only win by tendering now.,2021-11-02T20:20:30Z
$PQEFF Guys, don&#39;t take anyone&#39;s word for anything, not even mine. Fidelity told me Feb. 4th was cutoff, cuz it will take a couple few days to process and get it complete. I asked how long to get them back, he said, at least that long as putting them in. Anyone telling you its five minutes, or right away, I would call your broker and ask. Look at what you have to do if you do it yourself, in the offer. Five minutes?? Four hours?? I don&#39;t think so. What, you think you call up the depository and say, give me my shares back and its, no problem. You should have them......now!! I don&#39;t think so, but find out for yourself. If they&#39;re in there, and something gets released like the offer, or even better, this is gonna run better than last time and you&#39;ll be in the soup line with all the geniuses...,2021-11-02T20:15:20Z
$PQEFF 
When we tender our stocks, the brokers / traders cannot lend our stocks to the short guys! üî•üî•üî•

If we want to withdraw it for any reason, e.g. if we want to sell the shares on the market, we can do so at any time,2021-11-02T20:05:33Z
$PQEFF SP didn&#39;t moon today so everyone with their 5000 shares is panicking. üòÇ Don&#39;t worry, the big boys and girls will hold down the fort.,2021-11-02T20:05:12Z
$PQEFF Anyone suggesting action that gives the bidder all the power does not have your best interest in mind,2021-11-02T20:01:47Z
$PQEFF  what‚Äôs the contact info for the board of directors again?
Whatever happens it‚Äôs critical we passionately resist any dilution or actions that hurt shareholders as a poison pill,2021-11-02T20:00:07Z
$PQEFF 
I have thought about it a lot.

It‚Äôs good for us in every way!

We can withdraw anytime within hours.,2021-11-02T19:58:39Z
