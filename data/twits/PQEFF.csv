Still an absolute bargain. And the price has stayed steady at this level. This seems to be the floor and I feel there is nothing but upside here.

$PQEFF Steady shorting continues. ~47.9% today. Have a quality weekend, all!,2021-11-19T22:43:46Z
$PQEFF The TSXV has a discretionary waiver policy with respect to minimum pricing which it applies on a case by case basis.  You would think the buyout would be good cause to exercise discretion here.   Also it occurred to me that Viston intends to take the company private.  The halt will have no deterrent effect on management in terms of its future conduct in relation to the exchange as there is likely to be a management change and voluntary de-listing in a matter of months.,2021-11-19T21:50:13Z
$PQEFF I don‚Äôt like see my account go down and in the red, but I want some more shares and still hovering on my average here now. Maybe we can drop it so I can pick up more before the BOOM!,2021-11-19T21:19:18Z

$PQEFF Here is the response I got from Shorecrest:
The 8K filed with the SEC refers to details of the transactions for the share issuance.

The share conversion was the result of note conversions. They have no relationship to a poison pill (shareholders rights plan).

The net proceeds of the transactions that resulted in new funds to the Company were used for expansion of the Company‚Äôs extraction plant and working capital.,2021-11-19T20:06:17Z

$PQEFF They wanna pay 0,74CAD for my shares,2021-11-19T18:18:49Z
$PQEFF  I haven&#39;t done a deep dive into the tech or management, but with the yes/no virtually tied in the survey, undecideds having a low opinion on FMV and the massive institutional shares added today (that are typically conservative), I think it goes through. Convince me otherwise,2021-11-19T17:27:31Z
$PQEFF preliminary survey results over 61m shares 13.68m Yes | 15.8 no | 15.26 undecided

*special no thank you to the Petroteq subreddit for blocking the survey, info matters https://forms.gle/mRzBPeshiLWtboYf6,2021-11-19T17:15:16Z
$PQEFF LMAO people were losing their minds a few hours ago and the share price didn‚Äôt even move.  Be at peace my friends.  I‚Äôll continue to hold patiently through highs, and lows...,2021-11-19T16:51:22Z

$PQEFF To be clear...Balmoral investments is a two bob firm operating out of Leeds in England. They would have trouble buying an ice cream never mind Petroteq. Can you just put anything up in USA? Very misleading for some.,2021-11-19T15:47:07Z
$PQEFF Don&#39;t lose any sleep over the &quot;Balmoral&quot; docs, it was not substantiated and was being investigated as a potential fraud.

To be fair though, the price might have had a better chance of success, take note Viston!!!!,2021-11-19T15:44:11Z
$PQEFF The expiry date on this offer is November 30, does that mean this offer is still valid?,2021-11-19T15:39:04Z
$PQEFF Guys, this is the same offer floating around in August that was proven fraudulent.  Would love it to be true but it&#39;s not,2021-11-19T15:36:13Z
$PQEFF The expiry date on that offer was November 30?,2021-11-19T15:25:17Z
$PQEFF Isn&#39;t Balmoral the company that was proven to be fraudulent?,2021-11-19T15:06:16Z

$PQEFF Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but it looks to me like the 52.7M shares issued in November were to clean up an old convertible note by transferring the debt from the original lender to a third party and then paying off the debt with shares. That doesn&#39;t mean they made the decision to issue new shares at the massive discount of $0.055 if that price was somehow specified by the original note. They could have been contractually bound to that price and had no other choice. Is that correct?,2021-11-19T15:01:34Z
$PQEFF L2 looks stronger than it has for the past week right nowü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,2021-11-19T14:51:41Z
