$PQEFF Chill, as much as we might disagree with them, we need these kinds of people in the stocks that we own. Everyone has their own risk tolerance and strategy. Also, who else will buy from us at ATH and sell low.

$PQEFF I love E-Trade but they call it a re-organization fee.

$PQEFF  Was talking with a friend who was going to tender 60,000 shares and his broker said something about getting charged up to 20% by the holding company when paying out on shares in deals like this.  I don&#39;t recall seeing any mention of this in Viston&#39;s details on the buyout/tendering but wanted to see if anyone on here has been told this or aware of a fee paid on tendered shares when deal goes through?  And if so and there is a fee any idea on % that could be expected? 
I am with etrade so this I think merits a call to verify but more sources the better ..Thx,2022-02-05T10:25:58Z

$PQEFF Do the shorts actually get anywhere shorting this on low volume? Admittedly a bit confused.

Have a good weekend, all!,2022-02-04T22:41:48Z

$PQEFF Yesterday Kingsdale called me (I didn&#39;t answer that call, but was left a message)and today Viston also called. Viston did confirm my amount of shares tendered( Their total for what I had was off) If you get a call on your phone that says spam risk from Toronto it&#39;s probably from either of them.,2022-02-04T15:07:14Z
$PQEFF For any of you considering Tomco Energy as a home for some of the PQE proceeds, (if/when we eventually get them!), here is some DD information to get your teeth into;

Tomco have of course already secured licences for multi site use of the PQE CORT technology. IMO a very low M&#39;Cap company with huge potential.

$AABB to recoup losses buy $PQEFF and tender your shares for 50% profit!!,2022-02-03T23:45:32Z
$PQEFF if your with TD just call one of their brokers. Tender takes 5 minutes.,2022-02-03T23:30:44Z
$PQEFF  I&#39;m wondering if the low volume is indicative of most of the floating shares having been tendered, since the extension didn&#39;t occur until the 11th hour so to speak.... or if its just and unwillingness on the part of buyers  to move the price higher and sellers to let go of their shares lower....   I guess we&#39;ll see which if the volume picks up and share price remains static.

I&#39;d expect if volume picks up and most of the float has been tendered... the share price should make wide fluctuations on any bump at all.,2022-02-03T22:58:09Z
$PQEFF  I got an email from Schwab about them extending the tender offer to Feb. 25th, 2022 now.  Anyone else get an e-mail about the extension?,2022-02-03T21:24:55Z
$PQEFF tendered again. The newly tendered share number get smaller and smaller, but I keep buying bits and tendering. I keep telling myself I‚Äôll stop, but‚Ä¶now 50k shares tendered. I know‚Ä¶not a huge position‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm good with that. It‚Äôs still money.,2022-02-03T20:10:10Z
