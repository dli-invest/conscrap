$PQEFF the silver lining is the bears will be off the board soon.. they sure are working late tonight.,2021-12-10T04:15:01Z
$PQEFF Just dropping my GXXM DD on all my favorite boards. Give it a read if you get 15 minutes, you won&#39;t regret it. I hope everyone is having a good holiday season.

$PQEFF the silver lining to the comical bed shitting by management is that if and when trading resumes on the Cdn side it&#39;ll be nice and depressed for gobbling up.,2021-12-10T04:04:41Z
$PQEFF listen, this is a Canadian stock and needs to follow Canadian laws for hostile takeovers, management cannot recommend the buyout offer until the 3rd party valuation is done (it would have been different if Viston and PQE had negotiated prior to the offer but they did not) read the pdf linked below to help you understand, specifically this part on page 28, ‚ÄúProcedural Safeguards
Subject to certain exceptions discussed below, the transaction types identified above trigger four procedural safeguards.
Formal Valuation
In all transaction types identified above (subject to limited exceptions) shareholders must be provided with a formal valuation prepared by an independent valuator‚Äù, so stop the nonsense of management is trying to destroy the deal and stop being impatient, we wait for the Haywood report and if Haywood finds another transaction then great, if not management will give their opinion on whether to accept the buyout, stop being scared and ignorant (link in comments),2021-12-10T03:52:13Z
$PQEFF Yes Dr. Bailey, please keep unlocking shareholder value.  You have showed such fine leadership by issuing non-compliant convertible debt, getting the company suspended from trading, and taking a complacent approach to the suspension. 

It was also great how you passively waited for months while an expression of interest turned into a hostile tender offer before you finally decided to seek a fairness opinion.

This is the Afghanistan pullout equivalent of a bid defence.  Having old geezers at the helm always seems to work out.,2021-12-10T03:50:36Z
$PQEFF objective bulls are just bears... sell and move if you have concerns.

This many bears is a great buying indicator. Don&#39;t forget bears are buyers.,2021-12-10T03:08:26Z

$PQEFF All you people that are pining for the hayward report dont understand that a pump from them is only going to make things worse...its going to make the market even more certain then they already are that the tender offer wont go thru ... it will fill the fill he delusion to the max,2021-12-10T03:03:30Z
$PQEFF I&#39;m a shareholder and big believer in this stock, my question is  how many employees do they have? And what exactly do these employees do? I&#39;m not looking for sarcastic comments, I&#39;m actually interested in the employee structure,2021-12-10T01:21:14Z
$PQEFF February 7th 2022, 4:55 PM ET. All former members of petroteq management have either been fired, fled with embezzled assets or died of old age. Petroteq&#39;s janitor publishes a press release after months of radio silence: &quot;We expect the Haywood valuation any minute now. The board will release its recommendation once they have reached a decision that is in the best interest of the shareholders.&quot;,2021-12-10T00:56:52Z
$PQEFF Wow, this is the worst tree shaking I think I&#39;ve ever seen man. still adding ; ),2021-12-10T00:48:42Z
$PQEFF proper valuation from Haywood coming soon.

Viston needs to increase price.

Haywood working hard on new investors and there are millions to be made in investment banking fees for bringing in new investors and strategic partners.

Petroteq press release coming soon. Keep unlocking shareholder value Dr. Bailey.,2021-12-10T00:21:29Z
$PQEFF Some posters getting desperate with the FUD. ‚ÄúManagement can‚Äôt run this company‚Äù guess what management can (and has) change, you don‚Äôt sell the whole sports team when you don‚Äôt like the coach. ‚ÄúThe Viston offer is our only chance‚Äù, false Haywood has been hired to provide a valuation AND find an alternate transaction. ‚ÄúBellridge sold/ people are dumping/ why isn‚Äôt everyone buying more‚Äù only Bellridge knows their true intentions I have a feeling they are recouping their cost of the original loan by selling now IN CASE something happens, this isn‚Äôt leaving millions on the table this is them covering their asses, as far as all the sellers that is more than likely manipulation to keep price down while accumulating happens, why can‚Äôt everyone keep buying more because retail has a smaller finite source of funds compared to MM and manipulators, buying and holding has much less effect than wash trades and short sales. Keep up the FUD won‚Äôt have much more time for it when Haywood drops,2021-12-09T23:54:53Z
$PQEFF Let me spell it out for you people. All that matters, literally THE ONLY THING that matters, is if this tender offer goes through.  
 
Whether or not it goes through depends on a) enough people tendering (21% of shares seem to be opposed to Viston) and b) Viston standing by their offer and it not being an enormous scam.  
 
If this was such a sure thing, why did Bellridge dispose of 11Mn shares? At $0.18 they left $4.4Mn on the table. If they liquidated their entire position, $16.4Mn, and that&#39;s assuming they sold everything @ $0.18 which didn&#39;t happen! 
 
Why did George Stapleton and Aleksandr Blyumkin leave. Are they confident they&#39;ll cash out or are they distancing themselves from a dumpster fire? 
 
Stop revering the technology and realize you need competent management to deploy your ideas. Everyone has ideas, it&#39;s execution that counts. In 2018 they joined the freakin the blockchain trend. For years they have diluted shareholders. Is this management you trust?,2021-12-09T23:38:47Z
$PQEFF grabbed another 10K shares today! GO PQEFF GO!,2021-12-09T20:21:49Z
@PennyStocksToday Tender offering for $PQEFF shares at a 339% premium - is it worth it? 

https://pennystocks.today/pqeff-stock-tender-offering/,2021-12-09T20:06:41Z
$PQEFF like a sign from on high, out of the blue Schwab sent me a reminder about the tender offer today üòÇ. Will wait for middle of next month, but I am guessing there will be a tidal wave of tendering should the Haywood report fizzle out.,2021-12-09T18:32:27Z
$PQEFF management üëèüëèüëè so far great leadershipüí© i think my prediction of 5 cents if this offer is not completed isn&#39;t too far off the mark.,2021-12-09T18:18:51Z
$PQEFF This thing should have AT LEAST stabilized in the .20s and inched higher with everything that&#39;s going on.,2021-12-09T18:06:47Z
$PQEFF even the most bullish investor has to start questioning themselves here... buyout offer for .59 and share price is at .12 cents now...spare me with the conspiracy theories of Viston shorting and driving down the price.,2021-12-09T17:52:49Z
$PQEFF OK PQEFF, wtf.  STOP SLIDING.  I could have bought twice as much instead of .23 a month ago.  *ucking do something already,2021-12-09T17:51:10Z
$PQEFF me too but sadly only 10,000,2021-12-09T17:46:05Z
$PQEFF just picked up another 115k shares at .126.... keep em coming.,2021-12-09T17:27:25Z
$PQEFF someone must be dumping,2021-12-09T17:18:52Z
$PQEFF Every .15 I lose in other stock I think &quot;that could&#39;ve been 1 PQEFF&quot; ..  ü§£ Petroteq Anonymous meetings needed. üòú,2021-12-09T17:09:44Z
$PQEFF Board and executives are out of a job if the company is bought out.  Wonder if that&#39;s a factor? Executives are jumping ship en mass already.  Board has serious conflicts of interest,2021-12-09T16:45:53Z
$PQEFF bears are buyers... don&#39;t forget... bears are buyers.

Viston is just going to have to increase their low ball offer...,2021-12-09T16:31:16Z
$PQEFF It will be interesting to see the market reaction once Haywood releases their sham report telling sharehoders and the BOD that the Company supposedly should be valued at $2.00... and that they should not tender and wait for a better offer...will the new pumped up valuation make the stock rise or will it dump because it would be a nail in the coffin to a chance of people accepting Vistons offer?,2021-12-09T15:45:24Z
$PQEFF Reached out to Petroteq, gotta say it was a thorough response ..,2021-12-09T15:00:58Z
