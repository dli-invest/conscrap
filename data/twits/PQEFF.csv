$PQEFF got a few extra shares in my roth. We are in the loading zone.,2021-12-16T23:22:24Z
$PQEFF started the roth 3 months ago.. goal was get a 100k shares of Petroteq by EOY... Mission accomplished.,2021-12-16T23:21:04Z
$PQEFF Haywood won‚Äôt come before January IMO. Management in no rush. And February will bring more than Santa will.  $$,2021-12-16T22:56:30Z

$PQEFF Impatience makes you pennies. Paytience makes you dollars. Say NO to tendering your shares.,2021-12-16T21:04:21Z

$PQEFF not big money but just saw a buy of 136,143 go by for .1400,2021-12-16T19:15:45Z
$PQEFF My favorite line from the 10Q published on Tuesday: 

&quot;The Plant is currently in a winterized shut-down, although it may be restarted and operated upon short notice for demonstration purposes and for the purpose of testing and evaluating different oil sands ores and materials sources from different leases and properties in the Asphalt Ridge area. 

We currently anticipate that the Asphalt Ridge Plant will resume processing and production operations in February-March 2022.&quot;

This Haywood report is not just a report...Petroteq hired them to do investment banking is my understanding...this means they are out actively seeking an acquirer other than the tender offer...I imagine we&#39;ll know something before the 10th of January.

Holding 1 million shares with 10.75 cent basis and waiting for the other shoe to drop.

I&#39;m sure everyone is aware of the information Tender website:

$PQEFF Everyone chill out and enjoy themselves, let the dice land where they land.  Enough with the name calling, and conspiracy theories.  It‚Äôll all be sorted out in due time‚Ä¶,2021-12-16T17:33:26Z
$PQEFF Everyone is bashing me for not tendering my shares but you‚Äôre all cutting yourselves short. We should be getting $2 per share minimum for the tech. Big oil will pay for it,2021-12-16T17:32:10Z
$PQEFF I&#39;m convinced that we will see a lot of price action the following weeks. Just be patientüòâ,2021-12-16T17:29:24Z
$PQEFF the price action says that this is either a scam or the deal or Tender will never go through,2021-12-16T16:46:53Z
$PQEFF I&#39;d be surprised if they have not already received the Haywood report, the contents of which are likely to need further consideration and possible follow-up action.

That said, if the outcome is positive, in that alternatives to Viston exist, I&#39;m sure they will want to produce their review to shareholders by end next week. Failure to do so will suggest there is currently nothing better out there and we can then expect an imminent recommendation to tender. 

More of a concern for me is the failure to end the TSX halt stalemate. The fact that neither TSX or PQE, (hiding behind a confidentiality veil), will tell us why the halt has not been lifted, is really quite shocking. It shows a huge failing in both company management and exchange regulation. W4nkers!!!,2021-12-16T16:04:14Z
$PQEFF suddenly... the crowd stirs... then... slowly... quietly... the begin... 
Tender! 
Tender! 
Tender! 

Its a roar now folks! Its pandemonium! 
TENDER! 
TENDER! 
TENDER! 
TENDER! 
 
A veritable frenzy. A near-riotous shout! 

TENDER! 
TENDER! 
TENDER! 
TENDER!,2021-12-16T15:57:31Z
$PQEFF I think that it&#39;s ironic that no one is talking about the Haywood report anymore. That was supposed to be their next big thing. It&#39;s ironic because the management is halfway into the grave already and they have zero urgency to do anything and don&#39;t realize the investment community left them behind with the Haywood report that they&#39;re still focused on it. I&#39;m giving them every opportunity possible but I don&#39;t think we&#39;re even going to get an update before the majority tenders.,2021-12-16T15:30:48Z
$PQEFF I despair reading some of the posts about tendering your shares . If Petroteq recommend taking the offer we will all tender. It makes no difference if you tender now or February the 6th, you will not get paid unless the big holders tender to enable Viston to get the required 50% + 1 shares they need. Unless Petroteq recommend taking the offer and the big holders join in, there is more chance of being struck by lightening than Viston hitting 20% never mind 50% from PIs. Totally pointless tendering until the recommendation and valuation come in.,2021-12-16T15:16:55Z
$PQEFF 0.17 by Monday. Not that stock price even matters at this point,2021-12-16T15:06:08Z
$PQEFF Anyone using Etrade successfully tendered shares?,2021-12-16T15:04:32Z
$ASTA 14 tier changes today - mostly upgrades.  
$PQEFF looks pretty interesting,2021-12-16T14:17:35Z
$PQEFF This evening will mark the halfway point of the offer period. 53 days have passed.

Achieved:
-swapped land with which they did nothing for other land with which they do nothing
-someone from management left the company

Not achieved:
-resume trading on TSX.V
-plant financing
-any revenue whatsover
-third party valuation
-competing buyout offer
-sell license*
-Greenfield starting construction or securing financing for it with their existent license
-any meaningful communication with shareholders
-keep shareprice above pre-offering levels, let alone getting it close to the offered price

*I&#39;m not counting the &quot;deal&quot; where the letterbox company doesn&#39;t pay a cent unless they actually build something

At this point I actually think it&#39;s likely the people claiming they won&#39;t tender no matter what are Valkor employees. No one but Valkor profits from not taking the offer with how things are going.,2021-12-16T14:12:25Z

Not long to go now.
I suspect many will be tendering come mid January which is a few short weeks away.
A 4x is nothing to be sniffed at and there&#39;s plenty of other opportunities out there to double or triple your 4x,2021-12-16T13:23:53Z
$PQEFF 28 days of tender.

Today is chocolate covered anything day. Think of all the things you will be dipping when you get all that money from tendering your shares.

$PQEFF to be fair this shareprice  action seems to be signalling tender. 
if no tender dilution of share value will occur. The company simply doesn‚Äôt have the money to take this forward long term,2021-12-16T11:29:50Z
$PQEFF I‚Äôm not tendering my shares. The tech is worth more than the offer,2021-12-16T05:50:29Z
$PQEFF I‚Äôve supported this for a while but I‚Äôm gonna tender out 100% unless PQ pulls a rabbit out.,2021-12-16T04:35:02Z
