$PQEFF Interesting theory I recently heard from someone whose opinion I value: if Viston doesn&#39;t get the 50+1, they will still go through with the purchase of tendered shares (which they can opt to do according to the packet they sent) and then negotiate a higher second offer.  The idea being people are far less inclined to tender shares if a company says &quot;Yeah, tender and we&#39;ll buy whatever&quot; rather than &quot;Hey listen, if we don&#39;t get enough everyone misses out.&quot;  The latter adds urgency.

I could see this because it&#39;s odd to think they&#39;d get, say, 40% and then decide &quot;Nah, not good enough&quot; and move on.  

Just a theoy, but an interesting one,2021-11-20T18:18:13Z
$PQEFF Then combine that oil with Quadrise technology for shipping fuel and you are even more green!  https://cdn-ceo-ca.s3.amazonaws.com/1gpi5hn-EB7F07CD-E241-4FAB-8A6C-08761B2636B8.jpeg,2021-11-20T15:38:02Z
$PQEFF Still think this technology is worth only 74 cents? We are talking billions of barrels in Utah alone, TRILLIONS of dollars! Let’s give the patent away for $500 million dollars because management who spent 10 years proving the tech made some mistakes? No thank you! https://cdn-ceo-ca.s3.amazonaws.com/1gpi56r-6D66249A-F025-4D63-9DF7-5C1B762CC27F.jpeg,2021-11-20T15:32:45Z
$PQEFF 
Still an absolute bargain. And the price has stayed steady at this level. This seems to be the floor and I feel there is nothing but upside here.

$PQEFF Steady shorting continues. ~47.9% today. Have a quality weekend, all!,2021-11-19T22:43:46Z
$PQEFF The TSXV has a discretionary waiver policy with respect to minimum pricing which it applies on a case by case basis.  You would think the buyout would be good cause to exercise discretion here.   Also it occurred to me that Viston intends to take the company private.  The halt will have no deterrent effect on management in terms of its future conduct in relation to the exchange as there is likely to be a management change and voluntary de-listing in a matter of months.,2021-11-19T21:50:13Z
$PQEFF I don’t like see my account go down and in the red, but I want some more shares and still hovering on my average here now. Maybe we can drop it so I can pick up more before the BOOM!,2021-11-19T21:19:18Z
$PQEFF can someone tell me if they have bought shares from OTC through RBC Canada? Cause TSX is halted.,2021-11-19T21:07:37Z
$PQEFF Closing green, up .0001 penny. .03%!!!  Have a great weekend everybody!!,2021-11-19T21:04:46Z
$PQEFF Here is the response I got from Shorecrest:
The 8K filed with the SEC refers to details of the transactions for the share issuance.

The share conversion was the result of note conversions. They have no relationship to a poison pill (shareholders rights plan).

The net proceeds of the transactions that resulted in new funds to the Company were used for expansion of the Company’s extraction plant and working capital.,2021-11-19T20:06:17Z

$PQEFF find me a more garunteed way to 3-5x your money in 3 months. I dare you.,2021-11-19T18:49:56Z
$PQEFF They wanna pay 0,74CAD for my shares,2021-11-19T18:18:49Z
$PQEFF  I haven&#39;t done a deep dive into the tech or management, but with the yes/no virtually tied in the survey, undecideds having a low opinion on FMV and the massive institutional shares added today (that are typically conservative), I think it goes through. Convince me otherwise,2021-11-19T17:27:31Z
$PQEFF preliminary survey results over 61m shares 13.68m Yes | 15.8 no | 15.26 undecided  
average fair value $1.88 CAD 
please take the survey if you haven&#39;t
*special no thank you to the Petroteq subreddit for blocking the survey, info matters https://forms.gle/mRzBPeshiLWtboYf6,2021-11-19T17:15:16Z
$PQEFF LMAO people were losing their minds a few hours ago and the share price didn’t even move.  Be at peace my friends.  I’ll continue to hold patiently through highs, and lows...,2021-11-19T16:51:22Z

$PQEFF To be clear...Balmoral investments is a two bob firm operating out of Leeds in England. They would have trouble buying an ice cream never mind Petroteq. Can you just put anything up in USA? Very misleading for some.,2021-11-19T15:47:07Z
$PQEFF Don&#39;t lose any sleep over the &quot;Balmoral&quot; docs, it was not substantiated and was being investigated as a potential fraud.

To be fair though, the price might have had a better chance of success, take note Viston!!!!,2021-11-19T15:44:11Z
$PQEFF The expiry date on this offer is November 30, does that mean this offer is still valid?,2021-11-19T15:39:04Z
$PQEFF Guys, this is the same offer floating around in August that was proven fraudulent.  Would love it to be true but it&#39;s not,2021-11-19T15:36:13Z
$PQEFF The expiry date on that offer was November 30?,2021-11-19T15:25:17Z
$PQEFF Isn&#39;t Balmoral the company that was proven to be fraudulent?,2021-11-19T15:06:16Z
$PQEFF legit????,2021-11-19T15:03:58Z
$PQEFF What in the hell is this tweet the offer just went up?,2021-11-19T15:03:38Z
