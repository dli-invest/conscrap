$PQEFF keep your eye on the prize which is the tech that everybody wants.   Thatâ€™s all you need to know.  The rest will take care of itself but will take some time so do you have the patience?,2021-11-04T22:12:05Z
$PQEFF Maybe Petroteq should tweet a FOR SALE sign with the price they will take! That prob would count as their response!,2021-11-04T21:50:13Z

$PQEFF getting shorted down,2021-11-04T19:24:00Z
$PQEFF it seems like management believes offer is to low.. I&#39;m sure most whales do...

These next 90 days will be interesting. et ready for a higher offer or offers.,2021-11-04T19:02:16Z
$PQEFF the balmoral offer is a scam. See note
https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/DE/Verbrauchermitteilung/unerlaubte/2021/meldung_210922_Balmoral.html,2021-11-04T18:56:19Z
$PQEFF Translation: Balmoral takes care of the implementation of the offer itself, so there is nothing we can do for you. If you want to accept the offer, please contact the following address directly,2021-11-04T18:52:09Z
$GXXM We had 270 watchers at $PQEFF  when I first started &quot;shilling&quot; my DD about the tech. That was well before the buy out offer when we were at .04. We had 4k watchers at $DPLS last year when I was &quot;spamming&quot; the DD and getting blocked left and right.

It is what it is. This stage of building the board out is never very fun ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£. Good luck to everyone.,2021-11-04T18:46:38Z
$PQEFF Guys chill - The offer below  is Balmoral. Not Uppgard or Viston.  This offer is only for German shareholders - and I haven&#39;t heard of one shareholder able to sell their shares to Balmoral. They seem fairly unreachable at the moment. Their phone/email goes unanswered.,2021-11-04T18:35:52Z
$PQEFF Too bad I don&#39;t speak that language. Also, I don&#39;t think they extended anything, I didn&#39;t get anything from Fidelity changing the date and no one else has posted anything...What does it say????,2021-11-04T18:29:12Z
$PQEFF Got a new mail about the offer from Balmoral yesterday through my broker. They didnt seem to increase the price but extended the date?,2021-11-04T18:24:03Z
$PQEFF just sold another 10,000 shares of JP at 1.40 and bought 71,000 more shares of Petro at .176.

467,400 shares strong. The teens are a gift.,2021-11-04T17:48:41Z
$PQEFF In case any of you don&#39;t know who @I_Invent_Metas is, you should follow and listen to his ideas at least. Unless your ego is so fucking massive that you know it all...,2021-11-04T17:24:33Z
$GXXM $10 million market cap DeFi play, trending up during one of the biggest crypto bull runs in history as banks and institutions alike jump on board. With only 120 million shares on the float trading and trading at 7 cents this is the equivalent of buying DPLS when it was .0002 or PQEFF when it was .017 or BITF when it was 50 cents...perspective helps sometimes 

By the time CryptoBooks and GoatX are live this is going to be so far gone.... $2.5 billion addressable market on the low end ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„

$PQEFF $DPLS  $BITF this could end up being another 10x-100x banger put it on the watchlist. If they execute... The sky is the limit

Roll the dice at these levels IMO,2021-11-04T17:11:20Z
$PQEFF They can come out and say anything. They can give no recommendation on the offer and say something like: We&#39;re not addressing the offer. We are working on a deal to build a 10k BPD plant with a partner. We are in negotiations for other royalty deals. We are this, we are that. They didn&#39;t address the offer when it was made to them, because they felt it severely undervalues the company. I doubt they will give Viston any recognition what so ever. I DO believe they will give us great news for the future, near and far. They just paid off some debt with shares, to keep the money for operations. What&#39;s to stop them from giving a partner they agree with a whole bunch of shares to build a plant?? There are so many things they can do with this tech, I&#39;m just not sure giving an opinion on Viston trying to steal it for .60 is one of the options they are looking at. Its not what you value it at, its what they value it at....,2021-11-04T17:10:21Z
$PQEFF if Petroteq issues stock to build a plant... that&#39;s not a poison pill.. that&#39;s investing in the future....,2021-11-04T16:30:59Z
$PQEFF Some questioning whether Viston has access to the amount of shares tendered, i am going to say yes based on this resource, and it seems they have to file the agreements on SEDAR, https://www.bennettjones.com/-/media/Files/BennettJones/Publications/Bennett-Jones--Public-Mergers-and-Acquisition-In-Canada--2nd-Edition-62Page.pdf 
&quot;Pre-acquisition Lock-up and Support Agreements
A lock-up or voting agreement provides that a shareholder will
tender to a take-over bid or vote in favour of an arrangement or
amalgamation. Acquirers commonly enter into lock-up agreements
with significant shareholders of a target and/or with its board and
management. The obligations in the lock-up agreement can be
irrevocable (hard lock-up) or provide for various allowances to the
shareholder regarding withdrawal and tender to another offer (soft
lock-up). Lock-up agreements are required to be publicly filed on
SEDAR.&quot;,2021-11-04T16:30:52Z
$PQEFF if they say there doing a poison pill viston won&#39;t drop out will they? They would not choose to get themselves suspended or delisted to go private would they? Does petroteq still need us.

Holding 250k shares nervous,2021-11-04T16:24:43Z
$PQEFF sad to see so many sellers. Reminds me when i bought this stock for under a dime a few weeks ago. 

There are really only two negative outcomes here
1) board does something stupid to destroy merger 2)shareholders do not sell to viston even if there is no real plan by board. 

#1 is uncontrollable. All we can do is email the board and tell them our eyes are on them and for them to do their fiduciary duty. Give them fear of lawsuits. 

 #2 that depends on everyone here and elsewhere behaving rationally if the board does not put something out definitive and actionable by Tuesday,2021-11-04T16:19:53Z
$PQEFF Monday is the deadline under the SEC rule of practice on time computation:

$FTXP $KYNC $PQEFF let&#39;s drill,2021-11-04T16:06:24Z
$PQEFF is there a running total somewhere for tenured shares to date? If not does viston have to report how many shares tenured before the deadline??,2021-11-04T15:38:26Z
$PQEFF Part of me kinda hopes this goes down to shake all you Fâ€™ing whining impatient mFRâ€™s outa here.  Then we can get down to real business without a bunch of annoying, impatient punk asses tugging at us.  Get it? STFU and let them negotiate.,2021-11-04T15:31:09Z
