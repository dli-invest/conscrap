$PQEFF my thoughts on why people are selling at 38 cents when 50% looks almost guaranteed in 4 weeks. remember this company has a lot of shares, before the recent warrants and debentures conversions and before the offer the share count was at about 500M, the vast majority of which would have a cost base of 5 cents or so. There are many shareholders who trade much less emotionally than we do, we see the 50% gain in 4 weeks as a no brainer but if your cost is 5 cents and you have say 5 million shares it actually makes more sense to sell a portion than to hold. 5 million shares at 5 cents is cost base of $250k, selling half at 38 cents gives you $950k guaranteed (almost 4x profit on total cost base) with potential $1.85M more at 74 cents, this is a much safer gamble to handle than holding all 5 million for a potential of $3.7M (with the downside of the deal going through and share collapsing down to 5 cents again).,2022-01-09T11:10:35Z

$PQEFF so what happens to price when shorts cover on closing this deal,,2022-01-08T19:29:56Z
$VSQTF Easily 10x bagger. Years from now 100x bagger. Best long term hold on the OTC  based on every measurable metric that I value.

$110 million NAV, set to double every 3-5 years.

Take 6 minutes and watch the interview and you will see why. Market cap currently $20 million. More assets on hand for every $1 you invest than $BRK.A

$PQEFF seeking alpha chimes in late

$PQEFF And remember too, Zbigniew Roch is the said President of Viston. But Viston is not to be confused with his heavy involvement with the European Business Club and Nobel Prize nominated professor Bohdan of Ecologic Earth Energy. He&#39;s head of the Viston M&amp;A shell for transactional purposes.

Much more leverage can be used for negotiations without revealing the identity of the bidder. Such tactic seem to actually work, as Bailey admits, disregarding the offer would be an awful blow to loyal SHs after many years, and the reason the BOD ultimately decided to recommend to tender shares. Again, many will believe this is too far in the conspiracy realm, but the offer has already been made, the BOD has recommended accepting it, and why not guess whose behind the curtain? Just for fun.,2022-01-08T05:08:53Z
$PQEFF so many will say its a stretch but I find it considerably coincidental. The term &quot;Viston&quot; seems generic enough, almost to the point I thought I&#39;ve once even heard the term before. However, after completing a significant term search in TESS and translations across German, Swedish, and Dutch languages, the word is actually not common at all. I believe some believe Viston is acting on behalf of a major oil player, a theory I tend to believe.  

The closest term I found to Viston was &quot;Vistone&quot;, which is registered by ExxonMobil and used by them for the past 25 years as a tradename in the USPTO TESS database category of &quot;..chemical additives, namely synthetic fluids used to improve the quality of oil&quot;. The term was also registered in Brussels through the EUIPO (European Union Intellectual Property Office) .,2022-01-08T05:04:31Z
