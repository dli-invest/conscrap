$PQEFF And remember too, Zbigniew Roch is the said President of Viston. But Viston is not to be confused with his heavy involvement with the European Business Club and Nobel Prize nominated professor Bohdan of Ecologic Earth Energy. He&#39;s head of the Viston M&amp;A shell for transactional purposes.

Much more leverage can be used for negotiations without revealing the identity of the bidder. Such tactic seem to actually work, as Bailey admits, disregarding the offer would be an awful blow to loyal SHs after many years, and the reason the BOD ultimately decided to recommend to tender shares. Again, many will believe this is too far in the conspiracy realm, but the offer has already been made, the BOD has recommended accepting it, and why not guess whose behind the curtain? Just for fun.,2022-01-08T05:08:53Z
$PQEFF so many will say its a stretch but I find it considerably coincidental. The term &quot;Viston&quot; seems generic enough, almost to the point I thought I&#39;ve once even heard the term before. However, after completing a significant term search in TESS and translations across German, Swedish, and Dutch languages, the word is actually not common at all. I believe some believe Viston is acting on behalf of a major oil player, a theory I tend to believe.  

The closest term I found to Viston was &quot;Vistone&quot;, which is registered by ExxonMobil and used by them for the past 25 years as a tradename in the USPTO TESS database category of &quot;..chemical additives, namely synthetic fluids used to improve the quality of oil&quot;. The term was also registered in Brussels through the EUIPO (European Union Intellectual Property Office) .,2022-01-08T05:04:31Z

$PQEFF 5.6m on ask?,2022-01-07T20:13:27Z
$PQEFF So I reached out to Kingsdale to ask if Viston was planning to release any additional PR prior to the Feb 7 deadline now that the BOD has recommended accepting the offer. The response was that they would if a superior offer was presented prior to the deadline that would require a rebuttal or counter for those to consider who tendered and those yet to tender. 

Obviously wasn&#39;t expecting much information, even if they do indeed have plans for new PR, wouldn&#39;t necessarily expect them to make that known. However, it did appear they were being quite apprehensive of releasing new PR until the risk of counter offer had come and gone, i.e. when the Feb 7 deadline expires,2022-01-07T19:31:01Z
$PQEFF would a statement ever come out when 50%+ has been achieved and the deal is 100% going to happen?,2022-01-07T19:08:40Z

$PQEFF Another day towards pay day, not long now!,2022-01-07T18:34:25Z
$PQEFF Low Volume is likely to continue now, as many shares in the trading float have been bought up and tendered, thus they are not available for trading.  With the absence of any updates on the offer, I expect we will continue to see slow volume,  and a slow rise upwards as the prospect of a substantial profit in just a month will keep investor buying as the time until payout shortens.,2022-01-07T18:32:28Z
$DTGI With the new addition of SkyNet DTGI expects its subsidiaries to do $18.5 million in annual revenue, SkyNet accounting for a 20% increase.

$PQEFF If you tender your shares and the deal does not go through, does  your money for your tender shares just show back up in your account at the price the day of tender or the current stock price, which will likely have dropped significantly in price.,2022-01-07T17:41:09Z
$PQEFF My German broker (Flatex) told me just now, that I am only eligible to Tender PQE shares that I bought before 23 November (this is the date they advised me about the offer). This is complete BS, isn‚Äôt it?? I doubled my investment since then.. any thoughts or similar cases? 

Here is the full response (translated from
German to English via Google)
++++++++
The offer that was placed in your document archive on November 23, 2021 can currently only be accepted for securities that were already in your securities account at the time. The cash compensation offer will not be taken into account for items that you bought at a later date.

Mr. Xxxxx, you can currently accept the offer for the 100,000 pieces that you bought before November 23, 2021. At the moment, we cannot tell you whether a new offer will be posted for the other pieces.

If the offer has been accepted, cancellation is no longer possible. You can view and initiate this in your order book at any time.,2022-01-07T17:34:59Z
$PQEFF I have not tendered my 1.7M,2022-01-07T17:18:50Z
$PQEFF The process to tender your shares on Etrade is extremely simple. BTW it is total number of shares you own currently, not total number of shares you owned prior to the offer. I guess I&#39;m confused as to why this has not gone up closer to the offer price, as this seems to be a no brainer and guaranteed win. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èI believe I will buy more and tender my shares. If using Etrade as your broker just call and ask for corporate action dept. They will assist you with tendering your shares. $38 fee and the offer is $0.78 Canadian.,2022-01-07T17:17:05Z

$PQEFF I just got the supplement to the directors circular. The board was unable to verify the underlying source of funds for the acquisition which is clearly the main risk holding back the SP.  Does anyone have any intel on this?

Please don&#39;t tell me that Viston has a deal with Uniexpress.  I already know that. The question is whether Uniexpress has access to sufficient funds.

I just asked Kingsdale about this.  They don&#39;t know and aren&#39;t sure if Viston will be issuing a statement about it.,2022-01-07T16:41:56Z

$PQEFF Most people tendered their shares so there&#39;s not much discussion on here anymore it&#39;s just a bunch of people waiting to get their money. Would like to know where people plan to move some of their profits or reinvest into when this is all said and done. Just looking for new trade ideas, would like to know the reasoning behind it as well. Thanks,2022-01-07T16:24:04Z
