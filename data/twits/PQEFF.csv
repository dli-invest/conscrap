$PQEFF I’m totally now expecting to get F’d over on this deal. Yeah I flip flop on my short term projection, next 3 months. Putting lube on list for store items.,2021-11-11T02:41:39Z
$PQEFF easy long hold PQEFF with green days ahead.

DPLS.. unreal CEO and major fighter for shareholders 
 and company.. multiple acquisitions recently for mostly stock... follow smart money.

METX.. $80 million market cap.. just did a private placement with an institutional investor for $20 million.. a lot of due diligence is done when someone invests $20 million at 60 cents a share and easily looking for 5×-10×. I have 50,000 shares at 57 cents... closed at 56 today on red market and sh.rt attack after a big spike. won&#39;t be cheap long. Follow the smart money.,2021-11-11T02:39:11Z

$PQEFF Always love these oilprice pumps whether they&#39;re real news or promotional.  This one seems to be real as there&#39;s no conflict disclaimer at the end.,2021-11-11T01:31:31Z

$PQEFF Daily short interest the last four trading days largely ticking up in the low to mid-30 percent range, with today at 36.4%. If you pan out to 10 days, it looks like a slow ramp-up again, but I&#39;m hesitant to call it that yet. Seems like a not-so-good security to be shorting right now, but what do I know? We&#39;ll never get a piece of news in the coming days that sends this rocketing up. &lt;/sarcasm&gt;,2021-11-11T00:16:41Z
$PQEFF Pretty quiet in here. Guess we will all wait patiently for a couple months to see what transpires. Then we make some serious $.,2021-11-10T23:39:13Z
$PQEFF Someone posted this on Reddit so I am passing it on (has anyone else had a response from Shorecrest?) : Here&#39;s a response someone got on a German forum from Shorecrest. Translated back to English.
Thank you for your email.
I am a Managing Director at Shorecrest Group, we are the information agent working with Petroteq.
Petroteq has engaged Haywood Securities Inc. as financial advisor to conduct a review of the value of Petroteq and potential strategic partners or strategic transactions. It will be necessary to allow Haywood the time to conduct a thorough review in order for the Board to make a recommendation to shareholders. The Petroteq Board, together with its financial and legal advisors, is considering all options and will make a recommendation to shareholders to maximize shareholder value. Once the review is complete and the Board has evaluated all options, this will be communicated to shareholders.

$PQEFF sorry I couldn&#39;t help myself,2021-11-10T19:39:41Z
$PQEFF  What am I missing? $125M to build a plant, even if costs soar and the plant costs $200M, you get revenue of $80 per barrel x 5,000 barrels per day x 360 days is $144M revenue, production costs is $22 per barrel x 5000 per day x 360 days is $40M so you net is $144M - $40M = $100M you can pay off the $200M plant in 2 years!!! Not including the extra $10 per barrel x 5000 barrels x 360 days $18M in sand sales, plus royalties of greenfield plant (5% x $80 per barrel x 5000 barrels x 360 days) = $7M!!! How is this not $1 per share already?,2021-11-10T19:04:48Z

$PQEFF if the tender goes thru do the funds automatically go into your brokerage account?,2021-11-10T17:24:17Z
$PQEFF ,2021-11-10T17:18:32Z
$PQEFF Love to see all the buying.  Keep it up!  If Petroteq has no answers, and no other bidder emerges, the offer will go through.  Stock up, hold, and if all else fails, Tender in February,2021-11-10T16:39:20Z
$PQEFF great day to own bags full of Petroteq and only getting better.

In the spirit of diversity I have 2 trades for month of November...

DPLS 9 cents 200,000 shares
METX 58 cents 20,000 shares

I will roll everything into PQEFF after trades hit.,2021-11-10T16:35:05Z
