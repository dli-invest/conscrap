$PQEFF WTF with this? Shuffling the board and CEO and CFO is one thing but why not even mention the buyout but rather say  
 
&quot;The Company continues to work with the TSX Venture Exchange on a reinstatement of trading and will update the market as ‚Äéthings progress. The Company is optimistic it is getting closer to a resolution of outstanding questions and a reinstatement of trading.&quot; 
 
Is Viston planning on keeping the company on the exchange? Or ???

$PQEFF Hoping this means it has become consensual!,2022-01-26T03:58:55Z
$PQEFF the top guys at Petroteq are restricted from buying shares while the tsx is halted right?  Since Bailey is no longer employed I wonder how many shares he will buy tomorrow while there is a 50% plus side on the table???,2022-01-26T03:56:05Z
$PQEFF I would say with the changing of the guard, they may very well have 50+1
Think I will tender tomorrow.
Just my thoughts,2022-01-26T03:23:14Z
$PQEFF To me it just sounds like they&#39;re keeping important people around and preparing for the takeover. 

Patent owner &amp; person with most expertise on the tech is now CEO, and the new CFO is this guy Michael Hopkinson with lots of experience in oil field as a consultant.,2022-01-26T02:28:27Z

$PQEFF negative spin, the last of the rats have fled the ship. The only remaining Capitan is the ship&#39;s engineer.,2022-01-26T01:58:48Z
$PQEFF positive spin. The deal is done, CFO/CEO out. Inventor stays on with the company since Viston wants/needs him. Sketchy eastern europeans, who are involed in Viston, have made  ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚úåÔ∏èand now ready to take on the world of tar sand mining in China. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ,2022-01-26T01:57:44Z
$PQEFF it‚Äôs done,2022-01-26T01:44:15Z
$PQEFF What does &quot;The Company is optimistic it is getting closer to a resolution of outstanding questions&quot; mean? 
 
ü§î,2022-01-26T01:41:51Z
$PQEFF Three weeks after the board recommended the acceptance of the Vistan offer (and shortly before it expires), they get replaced (all but one). Interesting.

Conspiracy theorists might wonder: Are the new board members on the same page? Is this the plan for some sort of alternate plan to give everyone an &#39;out&#39; from the deal? 

Are ppl that profited from the gain in SP done cashing in on the prospect of a deal, and ready for the rug-pull?

Note that I&#39;m not saying that any of this is the case.

I&#39;m generally bullish on Petroteq, though I feel uneasy about the fact that they have not communicated specifically why these board members were replaced at this time. Why not explain in the PR?

As they did not address that, I think it could give people the heebie-jeebies about all this and cause an exit / drop the SP tomorrow.,2022-01-26T01:40:38Z
$PQEFF this restructuring of the BoD is very interesting. The new interim CEO is the holder of the patents. Is he with the buyer (Viston), or are they already restructuring the BoD? Good chance we will see a friendly tender now imo.,2022-01-26T01:31:30Z
$PQEFF I was about to tender my 3000 the broker asks me please confirm the currency selection for shares to be tendered (CAD or USD). is there a preference what I can tender? I was thinking CAD,2022-01-26T01:22:28Z
$PQEFF now I am very confused. Why replace the board two weeks before the takeover vote date??,2022-01-26T01:14:50Z

$PQEFF tendered 103K shares and still have some more to go! Let&#39;s do this!,2022-01-25T23:50:54Z
$PQEFF latest OTC certification document states 87.1 million shares of float on OTC. 97 million shares traded since the BOD recommendation. How is liquidity not all but gone? Latest float count for TSXV is 392.4 million, hopefully 99% of those get tendered given the bogey for 50% is 395 million.,2022-01-25T21:57:08Z
$PQEFF Sorry board for flooding the board about a week and a half ago. I was going to buy a hundred thousand shares at 42 but then I changed my mind. I hope the merger goes through and everybody gets the extra money.,2022-01-25T21:18:59Z
$PQEFF where are you guys moving the tender proceeds? Personally I&#39;m going to double down and move everything into $RECAF,2022-01-25T20:02:57Z
$PQEFF just tendered 125k shares and held back 25k.,2022-01-25T19:51:51Z
$PQEFF I noticed that Stryker just put in a tender offer  for VCRA.  Right now the difference between the current price and tender offer is 1$, but to make real money you have to invest a ton of dollars.    I am watching it closely.  The tender offers expires 22Feb22.

$PQEFF i just hope the recovery doesn&#39;t start until after my PQEFF check hits my TDA account. :),2022-01-25T19:15:31Z
$PQEFF tendered today. 10k @.19 out.,2022-01-25T18:58:51Z
$PQEFF You&#39;d hope with the price of oil continuing to escalate this bodes well for the Viston offer price and reinforces their price per share offer.  You&#39;d have to think they priced PQEFF at $60-70 per barrel into their offer so $80-90 should solidify their thinking.,2022-01-25T18:55:25Z
$PQEFF come on Viston just end the offer now if you do have enough shares‚Ä¶ ‚úåüèº,2022-01-25T18:12:17Z
