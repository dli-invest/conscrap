I love Bailey&#39;s presense as CEO. he is very relaxed and confident and has the resume needed for this transitionary phase to really scale the business, sell licenses, or orchestrate a buyout. I also love how many times he has thanked investors for sticking around through the hard times. He obviously wants to do well by everyone and I truly believe he will. it&#39;s all ‚è´ from here

$PQEFF at the gas station by my friend&#39;s house. sucks for the driving public but so bullish for oil companies. if oil stays up in this range we are going to be cashing out so freaking hard on this investment,2021-10-23T20:35:03Z

$PQEFF PQE/PQEFF reminds me so much of Cielo (CMC)
CMC - 600M+ shares outstanding (PQE 600M-)
New patented tech for hydrocarbons (CMC garbage to diesel, PQE new oil sands extraction method)
Both have royalty agreements for other companies to build plants and pay royalties 
CMC on Jan 2021 10 cents SP on low volume (2-7M per day)
Mar 2021 (three months later) $1.62 SP on 50M volume (just under 10% of all shares)
Has since pulled back as tech is not commercially verified yet (PQE‚Äôs tech has been 3rd party FEED verified)
PQE trading at 13 cents USD on 2-7M volume per day has pulled back from June high mostly due to issues with TSX halt (issued shares below TSX min price without prior approval)
IMO we can easily the CMC type of run (from $0.10 to $1.62) with PQE once TSX starts trading again and more people understand what is going on here, the mysterious buyer in talks with the company is just a bonus and should help bring more attention once the uncertainty of the TSX issue is cleared up,2021-10-23T19:14:49Z

$PQEFF very different companies and technologies but this feels a lot like $gevo felt when it was way under a dollar. lots of people excited about the company finally turning a corner and getting things right mixed with skepticism from the past over old dilution, mismanagement, and failed promises. I think we end up with a run even better than GEVOs run was from under a dollar and into the teens as the applications here are just as big as biofuels and the marketcap is still very very low.,2021-10-23T17:21:03Z

$FWBI risk/reward seems good here, I&#39;m in. Also liking $PQEFF as an undervalued ESG/Energy/Tech play with near-term catalysts. $LEV in the EV space. $ASTS as a stealth govt/defense play with a huge market for its &quot;official&quot; product. $LUXFF still the best value BTC miner.,2021-10-22T22:24:22Z

$PQEFF Are we EVER going to get unhalted in Canada? At this point i&#39;m really leaning towards the &quot;conspiracy&quot; theory that it&#39;s being held back so the potential buyer can have better leverage. 

Idk, I&#39;m usually not a conspiracy theorist but something&#39;s got to give at this point.,2021-10-22T21:36:08Z

$PQEFF Not bad considering the blood bath in the OTC market,2021-10-22T20:35:11Z
$PQEFF If we want to talk about ridiculous but possible number - Suncor in 2020 recorded $10.5B (average oil price was $40 per barrel) revenue from Oil Sands but due to price of operation and low oil prices last year they actually had a net loss from Oil Sands of $5B, now imagine if they used PQE&#39;s technology and reduced their cost down to $22 per barrel and sold the sand for $10 per barrel, ask yourself how much this tech would be worth to Suncor? Now if PQE signs a license agreement with Suncor and after several years their total oil sands production was through PQE license agreement with a 5% royalty (I believe it would be on Net not Gross revenue but still with $80 oil the $10.5B would be $21B with a net revenue of probably $10B time 5% royalty is ..... $500 Million PER YEAR!!! that is one of the top 5 oil sands producers in Canada only. Expand this around the world and within 5 years this could be easily a $10B company ($16.66 SP) on royalties alone, someone check my math please,2021-10-22T20:11:21Z
