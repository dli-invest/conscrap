$PQEFF question

given that the BOD has advice shareholders to accept the offer, does it mean that they are tendering their shares too? according to yahoo, they hold 24.5% shares, does it mean this 24.5% is guaranteed to be tendered?,2022-01-06T05:30:02Z
$PQEFF can you tender some shares and keep some? Will there be a lot of paperwork once the offer expire or will they just take the shares and pay you without consent?,2022-01-06T04:03:06Z
$PQEFF I‚Äôm content with the amount of shares I have at the moment I‚Äôll hold until gets closer to the end of the month. To decide if I‚Äôll
Tender  but it is a no brained as long as they get enough shares for control just remember that.,2022-01-06T03:12:39Z

$PQEFF so what happens if you don‚Äôt tender your shares? Once they reach 51% then they‚Äôll take it over right? Do you loose anything if that happens?,2022-01-06T02:22:32Z

$PQEFF Anyone know how long shares stay in your account after you tender.  I am with TD and tendered this morning.  Thanks.,2022-01-05T21:28:42Z
$PQEFF I believe they already have about 50% of shares locked up as tendered... What we will see is the volume decreasing each day and the spread increasing, as tendered shares will, for all practical purposes, be out of the trading float... But with the BOD pledging to tender all of their shares, and the convertible debt holders converting over 110 million shares of debt into commons, you know they will likely want to get .58 vs .38 for all those shares. Then add in all the shares that have recently been bought over .25 and... well, you get the picture...,2022-01-05T21:27:50Z
$PQEFF STOP ASKING THE SAME GOD DAMN QUESTIONS,2022-01-05T21:08:53Z

$PQEFF microscopic float, easy to keep down. I bought more because I can&#39;t find a safer place to park my money right now,2022-01-05T20:55:09Z
$PQEFF,2022-01-05T20:28:56Z
$PQEFF do they announce on the 7th of Feb if they received enough shares to complete the offer? Or is it once they pass the finish line? Is Viston able to track how many have been tendered prior to the deadline? Newb questions sorry,2022-01-05T20:04:03Z
$PQEFF In the event we can&#39;t or fail to tender, will there still be a public market for shares after the tender date we can buy/sell into? There must as not everyone will tender and Petroteq has to offer a secondary offer to collect the remaining shares, correct? 
 
Say the deal goes through, the shares should then trade flat at a very small discount to the tender price from Feb 7th until Viston acquires the company to the point they can take it private, correct?,2022-01-05T19:59:30Z
$PQEFF My opinion: Why is the stock trading at 38 cents when the offer in 5 weeks is 59 cents? Bottom line imo is because this is still a hostile takeover which has inherently more risk than a friendly negotiated transaction. People who have been on this ride for a while believe the deal is all but done with the board&#39;s unanimous recommendation to accept the offer, however at the end of the day it is still a hostile takeover. The response from the market imo is very tepid, however that presents a great opportunity for anyone just looking at this now. 38 cents to 59 cents is about 50% return in 5 weeks for understanding how the process got to this point. For the average buyout deal both sides sit down and negotiate the terms and price and present the offer to the shareholders which usually causes a quick arbitrage to the offer price (and sometimes even slightly above for a brief period).,2022-01-05T19:53:19Z
$PQEFF is my countdown even relevant anymore?  I&#39;m hoping for an announcement soon, lets speed this badboy up!,2022-01-05T19:19:10Z
