$PQEFF 4 month lockup on shares issued, in this particular situation there probably wonâ€™t be a big sell off. May actually maintain upward momentum in the coming weeks,2021-11-28T05:05:44Z
$PQEFF Tonight&#39;s PR could mean more progress with the exchange than I thought.  The amended notes referred to in tonight&#39;s PR (April 21, May 20, July 2) are the only 3 outstanding unconverted notes mentioned in the Oct 6 PR.  All other notes mentioned in the Oct 6 PR have been converted, repaid, or issued with exchange approval.,2021-11-28T04:16:49Z
$PQEFF What I want to know now is how many non-compliant unconverted notes still have to be amended and upon amendment of all such notes will the company have satisfied the exchange.,2021-11-28T01:13:41Z
$PQEFF  No one likes to see dilution but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s the major takeaway here.  It&#39;s only 4M shares issued under an existing note which is less than 1% of os shares.  It&#39;s the amendments to the unconverted notes that caught my attention.,2021-11-28T01:10:41Z
$PQEFF Could this actually be... dare I say it....progress? Maybe partial satisfaction of conditions set by the exchange to lift the halt?  They&#39;re doing retro amendments of pre-halt unconverted notes to being coversion prices in line with exchange requirements.  This is pretty much all they can do to comply with the exchange&#39;s conversion price policy at this point, other than to pay a fine.,2021-11-28T01:04:50Z
$PQEFF so how much does this fall on monday as a result of the dilution? This is why i keep telling people to tender,2021-11-28T00:52:25Z

$PQEFF is the board ever gonna make a recommendation? Is been 3 weeks since they said they make no recommendation.  Valuation not done yet.  I can&#39;t wait for January.  A company that wants to maintain control fights for it.  These guys just chillin.,2021-11-27T23:04:56Z
$PQEFF is it February yet?,2021-11-27T21:28:27Z
$PQEFF Over a month since the official offer now. Many more months since the first offer in Germany. Since then management has not managed to get the stock unhalted, has not managed to secure financing for a plant or sell any licenses, and has not managed to get whatever is missing to run the existing test plant at highly lucrative margins despite getting several millions of dollars through warrant conversions. It has been months and there is no indication they have done anything other than calling Haywood (which should take about one afternoon to discuss, being generous, and an hour to do) to provide a valuation we still haven&#39;t gotten either. Someone please explain to me how this is possible unless one or several of these clowns are on Viston&#39;s payroll.,2021-11-27T18:37:54Z
