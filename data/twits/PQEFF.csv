No rush to tender. especially from folks that are trying to scare  you. Be smart and invest in doses and amounts you&#39;re comfortable with.,2021-12-11T23:24:52Z
$PQEFF consider tendering your shares. 100% guaranteed money now, is better than, 0% guaranteed money in the future.,2021-12-11T22:19:18Z

$PQEFF bears working this hard on weekends is an amazing buying indicator.. we&#39;re near a bottom.. buy in doses and be smart.,2021-12-11T15:15:46Z
$PQEFF Have a look at a company Acceleware (AXE) to see how government funding can help build a plant like PQE (AXE has a different technology for oil sands but is a good example of how governments would help fund GHG reducing technology in Canada) excerpt from last news release, “ As of September 30, 2021, total direct funding committed to the RF XL Pilot included $5 million from Alberta Innovates, $5.5 million from Sustainable Development Technology Canada (“SDTC”), $5 million from Emissions Reduction Alberta (“ERA”), and $6 million from three major oil sands producers.”,2021-12-11T14:16:05Z
$PQEFF Why spend all that cash without at least trying PQE’s tech? https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/how-much-suncor-and-its-peers-need-to-spend-to-hit-net-zero-142908058.html,2021-12-11T13:54:12Z
$PQEFF The FUD on this board is through the roof. The offer is real with confirmation of financing, filing with the SEC and major brokerages sending notifications on how to tender. There are three logical outcomes to this after the Haywood valuation: petroteq advises to accept the offer from Viston, they secure a better offer from Viston or a 3rd party, or they say don’t sell and announce a plan for financing their 2 5k bbd plants. There is a 4th unlikely outcome in which they say don’t tender but have no plan… with as few shares as the board holds, how many of you bears think others won’t tender? 

Now let’s start reading tea leaves. They’re dismantling their test plant next year and have replaced 2 directors with a part time guy and a gave another one 2 roles. Does this sound like a company that plans to be operating long term or maybe one that is working on a deal?,2021-12-11T13:27:34Z
$PQEFF what’s the plan gents?,2021-12-11T12:51:18Z

$PQEFF Just for the record, I am still holding shares, but we all know that the situation is on the weird side of things.,2021-12-11T10:44:09Z
$PQEFF This has probably been mentioned already (I have been away from this board for a while), but this is the building that Viston gives as its address. Even if it&#39;s just a holding or a shell company, you&#39;d expect something else, wouldn&#39;t you?,2021-12-11T10:13:42Z
$PQEFF  Please understand that many of the accounts contributing to the echo chamber here and on Reddit have very, very young account ages with no comments on any other subreddits or threads. They come and go mentioning how many shares they have &quot;bought today&quot; to convince retail investors that there are still interested buyers and demand. 
 
As far as I know, Bellridge Capital invested first on May 5th, 2021, conveniently just before the German offer went public. Now, IMO, Bellridge has realized it has fleeced shareholders as much as it can and is now exiting its position at a nearly 100% profit in half a year.  
 
I have suspicions that Klimov, MP at Bellridge, has associations with Zbigniew Roch, and they colluded to jack this share price up.  
 
If this is so certain, why oh why is the stock trading at this valuation given the &quot;offer&quot;.  
 
Make your own decision, keep your position if you want, but do not be drowned out by a few very vocal but likely fake bulls.,2021-12-11T09:42:28Z
$PQEFF In 2005, Doyle Brunson submitted an unsolicited offer to buy WPT Enterprises Inc., at a high premium to its then share price.

Shortly after, a PR firm hired by Brunson announced the offer. The publication of the offer led to a steep increase in the price of the stock. When pressed for details, he and his team stopped responding. 

As the unresponsiveness continued, the share price steadily fell until the offer expired. Investors lost tens of millions. 

When later questioned by the SEC, Brunson plead the fifth, told his lawyers to withhold documents, and to not testify.

2 years later the SEC dropped the case. Nothing happened to Brunson, a well known public figure in the US. 

Zbigniew Roch is an Eastern European businessman. Good fucking luck.

To all those saying criminal charges will quickly follow, there is historic precedence that exactly 0 will follow as consequence if this falls through, which I think it will.

Think I’m going to exit my position soon at a loss.,2021-12-11T09:18:57Z
