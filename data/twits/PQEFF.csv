$PQEFF Oil will be breaking over $100 and PQEFF would have been trading higher than .59 on its own without the offer.  Viston isn&#39;t doing us a favor locking us down at .59 a share.  Oil movement and the winds prevailing are in our favor going forward and Viston knows this.  They saw PQEFF moving up, on its own (up to .25) and they pulled the trigger with a lowball offer and now they capped us at .59 a share.  Garbage.  They need to raise their offer especially considering there are shareholders (like me) who have invested in PQEFF years ago at higher than a $1 per share.  Not taking a loss.,2022-02-16T00:27:27Z

$PQEFF  is any one taking the buy out at  59 cents or are you holding for bigger gains? 2/24/22 is last day to take buy out,2022-02-15T21:50:41Z

What&#39;s up with these new updates on valuation? Likely stuff that was instructed months ago? People using it now jump to white Knight/2nd bidder conclusions?
If so why so late in the game when they could have done it anytime before now. A second bid days before the tender deadline (actually 23/24th for final broker instruction so even fewer trading days) isn&#39;t going to do much for confidence. That would assume a motive, motive to disrupt Viston and unfortunately us in the process. Further delays, further uncertainty. Why is this particular group pushing this 2nd bid idea and then saying stuff like &quot;read between the lines&quot;  when challenged ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§îü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,2022-02-15T21:23:26Z

 i for one believe everything the bod and interim ceo do in the ordinary course of business is of no consequence and simply fulfill the minimal duties before the expiry date. 

This stuff is in the administrative pipeline, day to day

From the TO circular
k. each  of  Petroteq  and  its  subsidiaries  have  carried  on  their  respective  businesses  in  the  Ordinary Course  at  all  times  on  or  after  August 19,  2021  and  prior  to  the  Expiry  Time;

‚ÄúOrdinary  Course‚Äù  means,  with  respect  to  an  action  taken  by  Petroteq  or  any  of  its  subsidiaries,  that  such  action is  consistent  with  past  practices  of  Petroteq  and  is  taken  in  the  ordinary  course  of  the  normal  day-to-day  operations of  Petroteq;,2022-02-15T16:43:21Z
$PQEFF great disclaimer. Sand btw is everywhere. Literally. It&#39;s more about logistics and who you are selling to. Most companies are using in basin sand so Uinta would be their only market

Broadlands based their economic analysis on information orally conveyed to them and no testing of sands from the Indago Lease has been performed by Broadland or by the Company. 

Broadlands confirmed that they performed their analysis in general accordance with acceptable mineral industry standards, and that technical issues discussed in the Report are in accordance with the standards of Subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K (&quot;SEC S-K 1300&quot;) promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 In particular, Broadlands confirmed that they consider the sands at the Indago Lease to be Material of Economic Interest, as defined in SEC S-K 1300, and that Broadlands is required to expressly note that, as such, there is no assurance that the sands at the Indago Lease will be converted to saleable material.,2022-02-15T16:17:46Z

$PQEFF would it be possible to buy and tender shares on last week of February? If expected payout is early March?,2022-02-15T14:48:10Z
$PQEFF Another delay of a week or so might be beneficial especially if Canadian authorities raise interest rates early March, (as expected). Might strengthen the $Can in turn giving me more ¬£s for my conversion.

$PQEFF take your gains to $XFLS . She‚Äôs just getting started, long awaited audits and uplist to otcqb is pending. Get it while it‚Äôs cheap, transparent company with a hybrid approach to the transition of energy.,2022-02-15T14:39:06Z
$PQEFF Huge income stream coming from the sand alone. Add the licensing fees with the 5% consideration on top, plus of course the oil, and it becomes apparent why Viston would like to purchase PQE at some would say a bargain price. Now where is that second bidder..Just rumours of course, but who knows?,2022-02-15T14:24:23Z

If any of you with Ameritrade are waiting until to the last minute to tender, be aware that they will tender as late as the day before the close date but not of the day of the close date.,2022-02-15T00:26:00Z

Trouble is in order to get the 5,000 b/d plant we would end up with a couple billion shares + outstanding. Viston offer is fantastic at over 400 mil and the bod agrees.,2022-02-14T21:01:20Z
