$PQEFF with the reaffirmed BOD statements for all to tender for the best and future of the company and shareholders… I’m might buy more now! Thought I was done.,2022-01-27T04:16:30Z
$PQEFF &quot;Viston and the Offeror (or their ultimate parent entity) and Petroteq have separately made certain governmental filings with respect to the Viston Tender Offer, a process requiring a substantial expenditure of time and resources on the part of each party to the proposed transaction. 
The Company has been cooperating with Viston and its Canadian and U.S. counsel&quot; 
 
From today&#39;s sedar filings...seems like a done deal!,2022-01-27T04:07:06Z
$PQEFF So, the BOD puts out a notice that they are firmly behind the buyout, there is less than two weeks before the buyout deadline for approx.  $0.59/share,  millions of shares have been tendered (so the supply of shares is greatly diminished), but 6.6 million shares were traded today AND there is roughly a 50% gain in the SP still on the table.   What are those who sold 6.6 million shares thinking?   They couldn&#39;t wait 7 more trading days to make 50% more.  On an annual basis isn&#39;t that is more than a 1000% return... I don&#39;t know of anything legal that gives you that... heck, there aren&#39;t many illegal things that do that!    What am I missing!?  If you sold today, drop me a note and tell me why.,2022-01-27T02:22:13Z
$PQEFF just tender with TD 272000. Took about ten minutes.
Sure hope it works out,2022-01-27T00:21:27Z
$PQEFF OK, who here got more. This is a safe space. My name is Konstantine and its been 1 day since I bought a share of Petroteq.,2022-01-26T23:46:14Z
$PQEFF It gives me comfort that the PQEFF BOD is unanimously going to tender all their shares as well. This shows confidence that the deal with Viston is almost a sure thing as I wouldn&#39;t think they  risk their holdings go to nothing by the tender deal falling through. Sounds like low risk at this point. Just my personal opinion and not investment advice! 👍,2022-01-26T22:58:34Z

$PQEFF I bought and tendered my shares but what&#39;s the honest bear case here? The fact I was even able to buy shares at a 50% discount makes me wary and I just want to be prepared for why this might not go through? Are there major holders who wouldn&#39;t tender?,2022-01-26T21:13:37Z
