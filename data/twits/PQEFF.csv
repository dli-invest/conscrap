$PQEFF  I thought the tender date passed? So I can still get on this?,2022-01-28T23:25:05Z
$PQEFF So next week is the last week you can tender. Join the common good and do it.  We have no idea how close the share count is going to be so every vote counts. Gratziüëç,2022-01-28T23:21:36Z
$PQEFF üòÄ Have an exceptional weekend everyone. Cheers üçª,2022-01-28T21:26:57Z

With all the additional buying and tendering being reported here, it seems like sellers are cashing out for a guaranteed .39 USD, while the buyers are tendering for the potential .59 USD, which helps the offer become a self fulfilling prophecy.,2022-01-28T21:25:22Z

If you do not tender and the deal goes through the stock may trade for a few more days then at some point be delisted. Your shares will be in limbo at this point until all legal requirements for the acquisition are met. This could take several weeks or months. Then your broker will be contacted and you will receive new stock ( if acquiring company is a public company) or cash, equivalent to the tender price in your account.,2022-01-28T19:49:46Z
$PQEFF Do we have to call TD Ameritrade? Any other ways to get it done?,2022-01-28T19:41:27Z

$PQEFF What happened if you don‚Äôt want to tender snd want to hold them, is 5$ a share in the future possible?,2022-01-28T18:13:41Z
$PQEFF Did anyone tender with scotia itrade? I did a couple of weeks ago but the shares are still in my account, just wondering if anyone else has had a similar thing happen. Just want to make sure my shares are actually tendered.,2022-01-28T17:21:59Z
$PQEFF tendered just a touch under 50k shares through fidelity today.  Was told it usually takes a &quot;couple of days&quot; for funds to get put into my account after the deal goes through.  When he was verifying that it was Petroteq, he also mentioned that a client yesterday also tendered a large number of shares.  I&#39;ll say watching almost $20k leave your account in a 5 min period doesn&#39;t feel good.  But if it is getting replaced with $30k you can&#39;t really complain.  Now the wait game.,2022-01-28T17:04:14Z

$PQEFF if you haven‚Äôt tendered by now you are playing with fire.,2022-01-28T16:32:29Z
$PQEFF hey Petroteq fam - for my Canadians who trade with TD - are you able to buy PQEFF through their system or does it get blocked? I know with RBC I can buy PQEFF as long as I convert to USD first and then execute, was wondering if this is possible with TD. I have had friends tell me no - also similar issue with Questrade. I‚Äôm trying to make friends and family money on this with the little time we have left. Thanks!,2022-01-28T15:14:04Z
$PQEFF Just tendered some more with eTrade, rep said should see funds mid-February.,2022-01-28T13:27:07Z
$PQEFF  Did anybody receive a letter of transmittal from their broker for the petrotech tendering?  Or is that something only needed if you own shares but don&#39;t have a broker?,2022-01-28T13:04:56Z
$PQEFF petroteq fam, check out Peru-based OG micro cap E&amp;P $PTALF OTC uplisted, big invitational investment this week,  production report, i moved all my proceeds from that to PQEFF and heading back over there as well as HZO.,2022-01-28T06:21:35Z
$PQEFF when should we expect cash if all goes through. Two weeks from tender date?,2022-01-28T03:45:58Z

$POAI I have some gambling money in the $PQEFF acquistion (unrelated to $POAI). If it goes through in February, I&#39;ll be grabbing another ~20k shares of $POAI,2022-01-27T18:51:49Z
$PQEFF still time to buy additional shares to tender.  I just did so today...,2022-01-27T17:59:23Z
$PQEFF tendered again! My positions are smaller than many of yours, but it all helps, and money is money.,2022-01-27T17:55:07Z
$PQEFF just tendered about 500,000 shares.  I suggest you all do the same and get the 40% upside from current price locked in.,2022-01-27T17:49:41Z
$PQEFF one week from Monday is Feb 7. To get your Corporate Action instructions submitted and time for brokerage to file Tender and payment instructions with Kingsdale, there are fewer trading days.  Notwithstanding the likely mandatory ten-day extension.,2022-01-27T17:47:52Z
