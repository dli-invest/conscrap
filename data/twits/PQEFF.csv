$PQEFF trying not to spread FUD but it looks like PQEFF will be delisted on a German exchange January 14? Any German speakers can translate the following document for us? Thank you!

$PQEFF I get on here and I see people say huge jump moving pennys isnâ€™t huge when thereâ€™s an offer on the table to buy your shares at over .70 calm down. However this bad boys still under the radar and when it does move it will be hopping by .10 each few mins rather then moving .01 ever hr tahts when itâ€™s poppin so sit tight and enjoy the next 3 months..,2022-01-03T18:15:16Z
$PQEFF I really wonder what management thinks right now. I have a feeling they are scared as hell because a higher share price comes with expectations of decent equity financing terms and managing to do fuck all will look even worse.,2022-01-03T18:15:06Z
