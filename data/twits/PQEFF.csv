$PQEFF Just wanted to say Happy Halloween ðŸŽƒ to you all. Here&#39;s my little girl dressed up as The Bride of Chucky.

Be safe.,2021-10-31T21:47:06Z
$PQEFF the expectation this week is there will not be much news. The board needs to respond by the Tuesday after next at the latest. I am expecting them to refuse the offer. I am hopeful shareholders will continue to email the board that a poison pill is unacceptable. If they don&#39;t want shareholders to take the offer, they should find a white knight or alternative funding arrangement for the plant that doesn&#39;t involve extreme dilution to existing shareholders. They should also allow for a vote without getting in the way of it.,2021-10-31T21:36:52Z

Petroteq is a NO BRAINER. 
One of the biggest NO BRAINER over the last years. If you dont buy @ these low mc nobody can help you.,2021-10-31T18:31:42Z
$PQEFF interesting stuff with some trading done in Germany on Friday. May be a hint at TSX opening up soon???,2021-10-31T17:59:53Z
$PQEFF Would like to wake up one morning and see it HALTED on the US OTC with a friendly offer substantially more than 0.74.A big player in North America surely to goodness would love this tech and make billions off of it in the years to come.  
  
Thats my wish!!!,2021-10-31T16:56:11Z

$PQEFF Yeah that&#39;s right, I just opened an account here now.  Everyone has to start some time right? Just wanted to share my opinion on why an offer 3x the share price looks good to me.  Not sure why that upsets people.  Maybe engage with the content of my post rather than when I joined.,2021-10-31T16:00:37Z
$PQEFF What really frustrated me with PQEFF was the tweet from Sept 12th.  The company tweeted the revocation of its cease trade order.  Well, thanks for that.  This was news that had been released on Aug 30th, and yet the stock was still halted.  Completely tone deaf on their part to tweet this news like they had solved the problem.

If the PQEFF board does not support the Viston bid, maybe they can explain why were they giving out shares so cheap that they broke TSXV rules on numerous occasions.  The Viston bid is 15-25x higher than the price of various tranches of shares that PQEFF previously released.,2021-10-31T15:49:27Z
$PQEFF ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ look at this clownish shill account below. omfg this is the best you guys can do????,2021-10-31T15:47:38Z
$PQEFF Shareholders should not put a lot of credence in these back of the napkin calculations that PQEFF is worth billions.  If that was the case, a major would outbid Viston.  A major would also have the technical and financial resources to actually start building plants.  The fact that there has been no interest from such companies, who are also hungry for ESG, demonstrates that $0.74 is the best we will do - and not half bad from where this is trading.

In PQEFF&#39;s hands, IMO the tech is worth far less than $0.74.  It has no funds, a bloated share structure, and a stock halted for months.  This is not to detract from the individuals that developed this amazing technology.  Good on them, but now this product should move into the hands of an entity that can drive it forward.

I&#39;m not a Viston bot.  I&#39;m a shareholder sitting with frozen shares .  Maybe there will be a more compelling bid that does come closer to these back of the napkin calculations, but if not, I will tender.,2021-10-31T15:44:14Z
$PQEFF Reminder to all that there is no incentive in tendering your shares early.  See what the company has to say and put pressure on the bidder to increase their offer.  They want this tech and they didn&#39;t start at their highest bid.  Make them creep up to 80 cents, then a dollar, etc,2021-10-31T15:10:04Z
$PQEFF So, I have a email from Vanguard saying I am eligible to participate in the Tender Offer, but its not showing me an explanation of how it works. I plan on calling the tomorrow, but can anyone explain what my options are???,2021-10-31T13:33:36Z
$PQEFF There really should only be 3 types of shareholders/posters on the message boards at this point:
1) longs who want everyone to buy so share price goes up past 74 cents and the deal is voted down
2) flippers and buyout chasers who want everyone to buy so they can sell earlier than February at close to buyout price 
3) those who spread FUD and want people to tender their shares ASAP, I wonder why they would want to do that or who would benefit more than shareholders who are better off with option 1 or 2?,2021-10-31T13:17:23Z
$PQEFF folks, we are going to be rich soon. Looking forward to doing blow off some hookers ass with all of you,2021-10-31T13:13:50Z
$PQEFF 
For a little perspective, the &quot;war on oil&quot; isn&#39;t on extraction techniques, but on hydrocarbons itself.  The oil produced wont have changed any.  As much as this opens up new grounds for drilling, the current fuck wad in office is on a crusade to stop drilling all together (which is a red herring in itself and completely unrealistic at this point but don&#39;t get me started.)

As much as this is fascinating tech, and I hold shares and look at the massive potential, this can go many ways..... just be weary of unrealistic starry eyed gains.

Lets see what management has to offer....hopefully there is also a bidding war to draw in some free wheeling paper hands to drive the price up as well.

Good luck Apes,2021-10-31T12:49:24Z
$PQEFF everyone tender!!!,2021-10-31T11:56:43Z
