$PQEFF has a buyout offer for 60 cents a share and is at the inflection point of expanding their business in a massive way even if shareholders reject the buyout. 

 but $aabb has way more momentum and big news coming too. 

which reaches 60 cents first!?!! 

I think AABB might, although I feel safer in pqeff.,2021-11-02T01:36:42Z

$AABB and $pqeff about to make OTC great again!,2021-11-02T00:06:39Z
$PQEFF got my offer booklet which is a confirmation we are worth much more than the current share price,2021-11-01T23:16:12Z
$PQEFF on another note- and I‚Äôm just asking- perhaps I missed something, however since we have a functioning plant, is that plant producing product and generating cash daily? Are they selling said product daily to local refineries? We all heard about the one tanker truckload sold, and nothing since. Are we to assume they are in daily production at small scale generating revenue? I have heard no word of daily operations and producing - even at this small scale since. Just asking- perhaps I miss understand.,2021-11-01T22:36:21Z
$PQEFF petroteq isn&#39;t going to exactly follow the OTC market as a whole, because it&#39;s a much more interesting story than the rest of OTC, but a rising tide...,2021-11-01T20:58:46Z
$PQEFF I&#39;ll eat a turd if there isn&#39;t a bidding war here soon.,2021-11-01T20:16:38Z

$PQEFF I am pondering why this stock isn&#39;t higher due to the takeover bids.   I would like to hear other reasons than what I list.  
1. People think the BOD don&#39;t like the current offer(s) and will eventually throw a poison pill in the punch bowl and ruin the party.
2.  Major players (Exxon,Shell, Saudi Aramco) haven&#39;t stepped in and made bids because they know something about the market or this tech that we don&#39;t.   (Don&#39;t write that they don&#39;t know about this tech.  The main guy at PQEFF is a former Exxon Exec.  You can&#39;t tell me with a straight face he hasn&#39;t spoken to his former colleagues about this tech.)   
I am looking to hear reasoned thoughts on why it is NOT higher now NOT rants on why it is going to go higher soon.     NOTE:  I don&#39;t think anyone here (ST) is a major player in the oil biz ergo, nothing we write here will affect the future of this stock so ranting about it here is folly.   Full disclosure: I own this stock and want it to go up.,2021-11-01T19:58:21Z

$PQEFF just takes like a million shares bought to move it up a cent and like 20,000 to move it down a cent lol tough battle until we get more attention.,2021-11-01T18:36:38Z

$PQEFF when defining a fair buyout price , one might look at the 5 year chart‚Ä¶ between 2 and 7$ sounds good for those initial investors.,2021-11-01T17:32:55Z
$PQEFF Petroteq is running even though trading is restricted and the company hasn&#39;t released their response to the offer yet because there are more smart people than dumb people so....we running up a bit today!!!,2021-11-01T17:32:04Z

$PQEFF just chillin&#39;. hold for gold,2021-11-01T16:51:15Z
$PQEFF Exactly right.  Whether or not you feel this stock is worth more than the offer doesn&#39;t change the fact that tendering now makes no sense.  You&#39;ve got time.  If Viston wants this badly enough, and they do, they&#39;ll increase the offer.  They didn&#39;t start with their highest bid.,2021-11-01T16:46:04Z
$PQEFF I&#39;m not turning my nose up at the Viston offer, nor am I tendering my shares, in fact I plan to buy more as soon as the TSX allows.
Then I will wait to hear what the BoD have to say and decide for myself my next move. I won&#39;t be tendering this year for sure but depending on what happens over the next two and a half months, I may tender them in future.

Remember, the stock market is a mechanism for impatient investors to transfer their wealth to patient investors!!!!,2021-11-01T16:36:33Z

$PQEFF ignore the noise.  All that matters is the game changing tech that everyone wants so keep it simple and hold for gold.  That‚Äôs how easy investing works.  Sure you can try and take profits early but when you find gems like this, you hold them which includes $AABB,2021-11-01T15:34:14Z
