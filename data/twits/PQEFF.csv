$PQEFF hmmm I wonder if the lack of movement is people tendering their shares and not selling/buying. Any thoughts?,2021-11-16T02:18:09Z
$PQEFF It&#39;s paiiiiinfully obvious that Petroteq doesn&#39;t want anyone to tender the offer yet, and they also explain that you can and should withdraw your common shares (including how to do so) from the tender. They emphasize multiple times they are trying to get the best deal, but it largely hinges on the Haywood review and them continuing to explore alternative options, &quot;including value-maximizing alternatives, equity or debt financings, core and non-core asset sales, strategic investments, joint ventures and mergers.&quot;,2021-11-16T01:51:21Z
$PQEFF Several people have asked for my opinion of Petroteq&#39;s packet. I think the two-page statement at the front, followed by the multiple page FAQ that follows, makes it clear that Petroteq believes that not only is Viston Offer lacking on multiple fronts, but the Petroteq board has full confidence that the offer is lowballed. They talk about the review process that is now going on, in cooperation with Haywood. My impression is they have their hands full exploring every other possible option that makes sense. The document is laid out fairly well, and they expect to contact shareholders with more information in the near future. (See attached two images in the comments of this post.),2021-11-16T01:42:39Z
$PQEFF I just opened a channel in my Discord for Petroteq.  I&#39;m looking for any DD you might have. Invite in comments.  Thank you, Penny,2021-11-16T01:30:22Z

$PQEFF deep in the money and not selling my bag of shares!,2021-11-15T19:18:34Z
$PQEFF the last two extensions Tomco reported in the morning (and the end of september one even a day early). Either they have some last minute deal and thus didn&#39;t publish their standard extension message yet or management is just moving what&#39;s left of the money offshore after they lost the downpayment. Either way a further extension appears less likely now.,2021-11-15T17:36:42Z
$CWSFF If you&#39;re into ESG stuff, check out $GGPI or $PQEFF or that ESGfireat40 site or go to cash if nothing intrigues you at the moment.  But whatever you do, don&#39;t stay here.  Good money after bad is not a strategy.,2021-11-15T17:13:11Z

$PQEFF When considering whether to tender your shares, consider the tax consequences. For many of us, if we hold out longer, more of the shares sold would be subject to long term vs short term capital gains.,2021-11-15T16:17:36Z
$PQEFF Let&#39;s have it right...Viston know that if even 100% of private shareholders tender their shares, Viston wont even come close to getting the required 50% of shares needed for their very hostile takeover attempt. They need the big players to submit their shares, and I doubt 0.74c is going to float their boat..Will Viston improve their offer? No idea but who goes in with their best offer as a first bid? I get the feeling that Viston is no more than a stalking horse with &quot;others&quot; watching what develops. If you wish to tender then go ahead as it&#39;s your money, But...leaving it till say middle of January seems a much more sensible approach imo.,2021-11-15T15:19:32Z

$PQEFF Read the Reddit post. A nice recap of the events. As admitted by Viston, Petroteq has good upside. What a shell Company like Viston do buying Petroteq? How would they profit? Why not Petroteq who have all the knowledge in the field cannot do it? It is like a prince is born and some wicked person comes and says to the mother you cannot raise the prince into a good King! So let me do it and become Kings mother! I would go with BOD all the way and also keep the valuable tech in N.America.,2021-11-15T14:07:04Z
