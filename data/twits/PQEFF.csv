$POAI I have some gambling money in the $PQEFF acquistion (unrelated to $POAI). If it goes through in February, I&#39;ll be grabbing another ~20k shares of $POAI,2022-01-27T18:51:49Z
$PQEFF still time to buy additional shares to tender.  I just did so today...,2022-01-27T17:59:23Z
$PQEFF tendered again! My positions are smaller than many of yours, but it all helps, and money is money.,2022-01-27T17:55:07Z
$PQEFF just tendered about 500,000 shares.  I suggest you all do the same and get the 40% upside from current price locked in.,2022-01-27T17:49:41Z
$PQEFF one week from Monday is Feb 7. To get your Corporate Action instructions submitted and time for brokerage to file Tender and payment instructions with Kingsdale, there are fewer trading days.  Notwithstanding the likely mandatory ten-day extension.,2022-01-27T17:47:52Z

DON‚ÄôT FORGET TO TENDER!!

Really only about 4 business days left to do it given broker deadlines.

Retail/individuals will play HUGE role in the success of this buyout given that the top 10 shareholders only make up about 30% of shares needed for 50%+1. Can‚Äôt assume they will tender everything either.

If you are thinking about waiting to see the results and hoping for liquidity in the result of a failed deal, the bids will likely gap straight down the second a ‚Äúfailed deal‚Äù announcement comes out so there‚Äôs really no safety net there.

SO TENDER!! Or sell I guess if you‚Äôre anxious about the deal (I mean that nicely cause I get it if you are).,2022-01-27T16:54:29Z
$PQEFF Tendered ALL my 50,000 shares today....was tough to let it go....,2022-01-27T16:29:56Z
$PQEFF Good question, @BBMO. Survey says &quot;yes.&quot;,2022-01-27T14:18:59Z
$PQEFF Ok shorties.. trying to get another buy today. Can we get it down to .36 .. 37? Really only time I&#39;ve ever wanted .. wait a minute! Are there any shorts left here? ü§£,2022-01-27T13:44:30Z

$PQEFF I&#39;ve been holding NIO like an ASSHOLE! $33 avg and should have dumped them, and moved to PQEFF. I should prob go ahead and take all my losses, and try to make em up here. Thoughts?,2022-01-27T11:00:12Z
$PQEFF Is anyone else slightly off-put by the part of their statement where they mention the substantial cost of making government filings? 
 
Really, today&#39;s PR is meaningless, as in the recommendation circular it was stated that the company&#39;s officers/directors were going to tender their shares already.  
 
Why does Petroteq have to tell us how much money they and Viston have spent to encourage us to tender? Why does Petroteq even care (aside from financial interest at this point to ensure the deal closes)? It&#39;s like Petroteq themselves are trying to lend credence to the deal, which maybe they are trying to do to appease shareholders seeing the lag in SP, but I can&#39;t understand why they&#39;d do that with relatively limited information.,2022-01-27T09:07:40Z
$PQEFF with the reaffirmed BOD statements for all to tender for the best and future of the company and shareholders‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm might buy more now! Thought I was done.,2022-01-27T04:16:30Z
$PQEFF &quot;Viston and the Offeror (or their ultimate parent entity) and Petroteq have separately made certain governmental filings with respect to the Viston Tender Offer, a process requiring a substantial expenditure of time and resources on the part of each party to the proposed transaction. 
The Company has been cooperating with Viston and its Canadian and U.S. counsel&quot; 
 
From today&#39;s sedar filings...seems like a done deal!,2022-01-27T04:07:06Z
$PQEFF So, the BOD puts out a notice that they are firmly behind the buyout, there is less than two weeks before the buyout deadline for approx.  $0.59/share,  millions of shares have been tendered (so the supply of shares is greatly diminished), but 6.6 million shares were traded today AND there is roughly a 50% gain in the SP still on the table.   What are those who sold 6.6 million shares thinking?   They couldn&#39;t wait 7 more trading days to make 50% more.  On an annual basis isn&#39;t that is more than a 1000% return... I don&#39;t know of anything legal that gives you that... heck, there aren&#39;t many illegal things that do that!    What am I missing!?  If you sold today, drop me a note and tell me why.,2022-01-27T02:22:13Z
$PQEFF just tender with TD 272000. Took about ten minutes.
Sure hope it works out,2022-01-27T00:21:27Z
$PQEFF OK, who here got more. This is a safe space. My name is Konstantine and its been 1 day since I bought a share of Petroteq.,2022-01-26T23:46:14Z
$PQEFF It gives me comfort that the PQEFF BOD is unanimously going to tender all their shares as well. This shows confidence that the deal with Viston is almost a sure thing as I wouldn&#39;t think they  risk their holdings go to nothing by the tender deal falling through. Sounds like low risk at this point. Just my personal opinion and not investment advice! üëç,2022-01-26T22:58:34Z

$PQEFF I bought and tendered my shares but what&#39;s the honest bear case here? The fact I was even able to buy shares at a 50% discount makes me wary and I just want to be prepared for why this might not go through? Are there major holders who wouldn&#39;t tender?,2022-01-26T21:13:37Z
