$PQEFF Think what you want but each plant that anyone else builds is cost free royalty revenue, if the top 5 oil sands producers each build one 10k BPD plant in 2 years that is 5 x 10k x 360 days x $80 per barrel x 5% royalty = $72M per year revenue on royalties alone from 1 plant each! Now break that into EPS assuming 800M fully diluted shares is 9 cents per share, and add an aggressive P/E of 30 (not unreasonable based on potential of billions of future barrels to unlock) and you arrive at a stock price of $0.09 x 30 = $2.70 , this is with $0 expenses to PQE. If they build the first 5K plant themselves (highly unlikely now that Haywood is looking for a strategic partnership who would likely fund the first plant) their base case EPS on that plant after OPEX of $25 per barrel is earnings net back of very conservative $25 per barrel x 5k x 360 days = $45M or $0.06 cents per share, again a growth P/E of just 30 gives a stock price on 800M shares of $1.80,2021-11-13T15:50:39Z

$PQEFF Haywood will shoot us into the stratosphere.,2021-11-13T09:09:58Z
$PQEFF looking at Haywood&#39;s list of valuations in the past and comparing to the corresponding Stock Price/market cap at the time I can expect 2 things to happen when they drop their PQE report:

1) Disappointment from all of us when they value PQE at something like only 12 million CAD

2) Stock price to remain relatively unchanged.

Don&#39;t forget that stock price is not a linear reflection of co.&#39;s valuation. And that goes 10x for growth companies.,2021-11-13T06:17:57Z

$PQEFF In the new video released, check out minute marker 2:58 &quot;..back into the Earth&quot;. This is CCS carbon capture and storage. Seriously gaining major traction with Big Oil. You can do a quick google search and understand why. Billions of dollars pouring into this new realm of ESG this past month. Exxon recently created an entire division based on CCS. This, I believe, will be the primary selling point for many buyers/offerers. Negative carbon credits are obtained through CCS, subsidies from governments are received from credits, taxes, etc. Economically, the fact Petroteq can extract i.e. separate the hydrocarbons aligns 100% with Big oil immediate investments. Place a death grip on your shares if you own $PQEFF.,2021-11-12T20:37:39Z

1. Looks for me like mm and institutionales are trying to scare off retail investors in order to collect stocks cheaply.
2. Day traders and (naked)short-traders are playing their game.

We just need to buy and holdðŸ™ŒðŸ’ŽðŸš€
I still believe if we all would tender our shares (temporarily) we can get more then the .74 CAD/.60USD,2021-11-12T20:09:37Z

 Does anyone have any idea when the Haywood report is going to be released? Not looking for an exact date just looking for a general guess.

I suppose it depends on what PQE have requested and how much they are paying for it. My guess would be 2-4 weeks due to the potential urgency of the situation.,2021-11-12T15:19:37Z
