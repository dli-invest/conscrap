It&#39;s actually fairly easy to understand...,2022-02-04T03:57:02Z
$OODH just like $PQEFF but that one already ran 1200% for me from .03 $MDMP,2022-02-04T01:58:23Z
$AABB to recoup losses buy $PQEFF and tender your shares for 50% profit!!,2022-02-03T23:45:32Z
$PQEFF if your with TD just call one of their brokers. Tender takes 5 minutes.,2022-02-03T23:30:44Z
$PQEFF  I&#39;m wondering if the low volume is indicative of most of the floating shares having been tendered, since the extension didn&#39;t occur until the 11th hour so to speak.... or if its just and unwillingness on the part of buyers  to move the price higher and sellers to let go of their shares lower....   I guess we&#39;ll see which if the volume picks up and share price remains static.

I&#39;d expect if volume picks up and most of the float has been tendered... the share price should make wide fluctuations on any bump at all.,2022-02-03T22:58:09Z
$PQEFF  I got an email from Schwab about them extending the tender offer to Feb. 25th, 2022 now.  Anyone else get an e-mail about the extension?,2022-02-03T21:24:55Z
$PQEFF tendered again. The newly tendered share number get smaller and smaller, but I keep buying bits and tendering. I keep telling myself I’ll stop, but…now 50k shares tendered. I know…not a huge position…but I’m good with that. It’s still money.,2022-02-03T20:10:10Z
$PQEFF Not the timeline we wanted, but the timeline we have. Til then.....,2022-02-03T18:52:32Z
$PQEFF The only reason to not tender would be to chase the small chance of price reaching more than $0.59 before the offer expires and then selling at a price above the offer, right?,2022-02-03T18:33:04Z
$PQEFF and $RECAF are only green today,2022-02-03T17:54:31Z
$PQEFF Got an email back from kingsdale, I had it confirmed that most brokers usually wait 24 hours prior to expiry to send in tender instructions so these are unknown numbers to viston and were not included in the 144 mil count. 
Also said it’s likely they will give updates as regulatory filings and assessment periods are resolved which was the reason for the extension, not because of the share count.    
just have to chill and keep waiting lads.,2022-02-03T17:53:45Z
$PQEFF will they move the goal posts again on this tender date I wonder,2022-02-03T17:50:41Z

With so many red days in market lately its important to know what&#39;s what and keep your head - Know what you own.

$PQEFF give me 1 reason why anyone would intentionally NOT tender?,2022-02-03T17:19:59Z
$PQEFF Is there a risk of the price moving back above 40 cents and too many people deciding to sell instead of tendering? Or will the new buyers likely tender?,2022-02-03T17:01:02Z
$PQEFF Sitting at 130 million shares reported as yes plus 145m paper shares.,2022-02-03T16:23:04Z
$PQEFF love the volume!!,2022-02-03T15:53:42Z
$PQEFF,2022-02-03T15:46:38Z
$PQEFF It&#39;s crazy to me how low the volume is here today.  Especially seeing as literally at the start of this week (and the last couple of weeks), people were trading shares like crazy at $.38, it&#39;s under $.35 and it&#39;s moving around at a snails pace.,2022-02-03T15:28:57Z
Petroteq update: 118.7 million reported tendering (48k unsure).  Plus, the 144m paper shares reported earlier. ~262m known, please share and fill out if you haven&#39;t yet, $PQEFF https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfhcXXDbj3UlxoS0UBxalf4Wc7x01lS6gi-j9nhXzNsHU5g7A/viewform?usp=sf_link,2022-02-03T14:49:41Z
$PQEFF volume dried out significantly these days - less than 20k shares traded in 15 minutes.,2022-02-03T14:45:10Z

$PQEFF tendered my newly acquired bought-on-the-dip 2/1 shares this evening and Schwab has updated their acknowledgment page to reflect an update to February 25 tender submit deadline. I&#39;ve noted that&#39;s a Friday and Feb 28 is a Monday. Perhaps we&#39;ll get funded by March 4.,2022-02-03T07:21:43Z
$PQEFF Here is my email back to Kingsdale, let’s see what they say: Does Kingsdale/Viston expect to press release an update before the end of February when the remaining filing procedures have been completed? Aka when the only real remaining step in the process is determining the final tendered amount of shares? Does Kingsdale/Viston have access to the total number of shares currently held by brokers (such as my shares at RBC) and have at least a good estimate of how close to 50% (or even 90%) you are to the goal? This information (how many shares have indirectly been tendered aka tendered by the holder but not officially by the broker) could be very useful in swaying any on the fence shareholders who are currently spreading doubt about the offer on message boards. They often site the 144M shares tendered even though many people know that doesn’t include most broker held shares that number is still used to spread doubt. Thanks for your time.,2022-02-03T02:10:43Z
$PQEFF Someone said we had something like 18% tendered so far.  It sounds like that doesn&#39;t include institutions and perhaps a few more individuals will filter in as well.  
 
My question is this:   
 
I&#39;ve heard the Petroteq board holds 15% of the shares.  I&#39;ve also heard they hold 30%. 
 
First, does anyone know the correct percent of the shares they own? 
 
Second, do we know if they are included in the 18% that has already been tendered?,2022-02-03T00:55:55Z
$PQEFF tendered today ✅,2022-02-02T21:54:52Z
$PQEFF Why the dump today?,2022-02-02T21:37:08Z
$PQEFF,2022-02-02T21:34:15Z
$PQEFF green close?,2022-02-02T21:05:56Z
$PQEFF  Here is my final tendering survey, completely anonymous, I&#39;ll post totals as they come in.  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfhcXXDbj3UlxoS0UBxalf4Wc7x01lS6gi-j9nhXzNsHU5g7A/viewform?usp=sf_link,2022-02-02T20:53:46Z
