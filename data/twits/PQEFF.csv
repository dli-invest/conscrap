$PQEFF I‚Äôm assuming the resignees are buying up all of the shares lol.,2022-02-08T20:21:23Z
$POAI this company is really making me want to try my luck in dumping it and just throwing it into the $PQEFF tender deal lately. Really losing faith in anything tangible from leadership unfortunately :(,2022-02-08T19:30:42Z

$PQEFF  well checked this morning and if u use TD Ameritrade then u should be seeing a number where it would normally say PQEFF atleast tahts what I have and it doesn‚Äôt show a value of the stock price but my guess is it‚Äôs because there tendered so being transfered just thought I‚Äôd clear up for some out there freaking out your all good.. lol,2022-02-08T14:24:22Z
$PQEFF be careful if you are on Interactive Brokers.  I had tendered my shares previously. But with the new extension they were NOT tendered anymore, I had to go myself and resubmit,2022-02-08T13:43:05Z
$PQEFF My UK broker Hargreaves Lansdown has replied to my email asking if my shares had been tendered as per my instruction and their 1st Feb cut-off date for tendering. 
 
They say they are now aware of the extension and will take instructions on my shares up until 24th Feb. They expect cash to be in account within 10 days of the revised date (28th). 
 
So, no shares tendered yet from the broker and it looks like I will need to wait longer for my tender proceeds, probably due to differing jurisdictions. Annoying as Tomco is on the rise and that was going to be a home for some of my profits...,2022-02-08T13:26:34Z

$PQEFF very interesting!!!,2022-02-08T03:28:14Z
$PQEFF hurry the fuck up already and cash me out ü§£ü§£,2022-02-08T00:04:42Z
$PQEFF When the extension came out, Vanguard corporate action page showed my shares as uninstructed even though I instructed them to tender. I tried tendering them a couple times and it never showed as tendered again. Just got a call that they are tendered if you did it the first time you are good to go. Hope this helps if you were wondering and have Vanguard.,2022-02-07T22:30:02Z
$PQEFF IMO the 50% is a certainty and I think tendered shares will be 75% plus. I;m hoping they get the 90% sought and hopefully accelerate the settlement.,2022-02-07T21:53:28Z
$PQEFF Less volume and larger spreads shows more and more shares are being tendered now, leaving less shares in the trading float.  Looking good Petrotech!,2022-02-07T19:16:54Z
$PQEFF and I tendered my shares in less than 4 minutes. You can to.,2022-02-07T18:24:21Z
