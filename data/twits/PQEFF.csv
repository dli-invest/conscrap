$PQEFF 22 days of tender. Reality is  fake. The offer isn&#39;t. ðŸ¤ž,2021-12-22T13:22:51Z
$PQEFF

I&#39;ve been in contact with my Swedish broker regarding the offer. In short they told me that I may or may not be able to tender my shares. Their lawyers are looking into it. 

If we get to a point where tendering is the best option, can I do that on my own without the involvement of my broker if they decide to mess it up?,2021-12-22T11:50:31Z
$PQEFF Noront (NOT) seems to be finished with their multiple offer bidding war buyout. The first offer was 55 cents in summer then they got a second offer for 70 cents, then 75 cents, then $1.10. The main key is that at each offer and counter offer the shares of NOT traded up to and just below (and sometimes a little above) the latest offer price, so if we end up getting a second offer this thing could rocket in a matter of minutes. The other big takeaway from the NOT deal is I believe the board recommended the first buyout offer of 55 cents and then before it closed they got a second offer, so there is a scenario where PQE gets the Haywood report (but no second offer yet) recommends shareholders accept the Viston offer and allow Haywood to continue to solicit a second offer which could be presented up until Feb 7 (even if over 51% have tendered) those people could then untender and accept the new offer if it arrived,2021-12-22T10:11:15Z
$PQEFF The silence from the PQE BoD is deafening. I realise they will be limited on what they can say but they certainly had plenty to say when the offer initially firmed up!!

With each day of delay of their &quot;strategic review&quot;, the more will be expected from SH to appease their concerns. To avoid a big swing towards &quot;tender&quot;, I think they will need to pull a very special rabbit out of the hat.

$PQEFF my 5mio stocks voting YES for buyout,2021-12-22T09:55:08Z
$PQEFF Hey guys. Bonus just dropped and I&#39;m a degenerate who likes to put my trust in strangers hands. What&#39;s the probable outcome here? I want IN,2021-12-22T09:32:08Z
$PQEFF ,2021-12-22T09:30:58Z
$PQEFF so apparently yesterday&#39;s rally was (partly) due to some retail whale with 8 million shares(screenshots could be fake, who knows) buying a couple hundredthousand more at the ask. See reddit live thread. 

 Quote: &quot;I am leaning towards Viston, if another offer isnâ€™t made. Too much risk riding with current management vs the best option Haywood develops.&quot; 

Great news for people who don&#39;t want to go broke on this.,2021-12-22T09:13:55Z
