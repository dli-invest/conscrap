$PQEFF 50c should be the floor and 60c the ceiling until a competing offer appears. If one doesn&#39;t.  Tender and get paid,2021-10-31T04:07:29Z
$PQEFF ok here‚Äôs my prediction, keep in mind I am a certified fortune teller.  Late next week, likely Friday,  mgmt will say they do not support the deal and reco we don‚Äôt tender out shares.  They won‚Äôt offer any alternatives and will basically sound like idiots.  Viston will then accelerate the offer to the 31 day minimum and we will have a hell of a circus going.  Viston will narrowly win and the company will get bought out.  I don‚Äôt think Viston will raise their price, your either happy with 5X or not.  6/7X ain‚Äôt gonna change your mind.,2021-10-31T03:56:26Z

$PQEFF I don‚Äôt think Petroteq is going to take the deal. The fact they warned investors nothing is guaranteed it sounds like they‚Äôre negotiating for a better deal, but won‚Äôt accept this one. I‚Äôm not sure how much viston has to offer but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to be enough, so more than likely the deal will fall through and I‚Äôm ok with that because I think the technology is worth billions of dollars not a half billion, so this will be a long term hold I think.,2021-10-30T23:52:20Z

$PQEFF I‚Äôm wondering who is willing to tender now, waiting for a better offer, or want the company to do it themselves.

Now is an easy 3x. Better offer maybe 4-6x, or hold on for a couple years (1 year after getting material and 1 year to build facility per their PR) to get more x‚Äôs

I hope there‚Äôs a better offer or a quick (under 1 year) plan for profits otherwise I‚Äôm tendering for 3x. Let me know if I‚Äôm wrong or why you are choosing what,2021-10-30T20:45:22Z

What a week it has been at Petroteq. Last week was only 11c and despite the pullback still up massively. Good time to hold petroteq. Check out the Petroteq video by PaulThomas where he called it

$PQEFF For those of you emailing Petroteq, how about emailing the bidder and telling them &quot;You want my shares?  It&#39;s going to take a whole lot more than 60 cents&quot;

$PQEFF Ive been doing DD via the reddit page and Im starting to get really bullish long term. They already have 86 million barrels in reserve already worth approx $6 billion. In addition to the newly vetted technology the bidding company wants. The tech reduces emissions and allows extraction from previously unproducible lands. check out reddit for alot more information.

I think the company will not recommend taking this deal. They seemed to already be in negotiations with the company and rejected it. They should provide a plan to commercialize this tech or reach out to another company. I would think majors would love this tech. If its as good as I read, I would be surprised if another company doesnt come in for a better deal/partnership. 

That said, if they dont come out with any of that then I suspect the large majority would tender their shares. If they dilute the stock is screwed. Im good with an easy 3x but If they show they can commercialize quickly I wont tender,2021-10-30T16:54:10Z
$PQEFF,2021-10-30T16:23:17Z
$PQEFF Always remember Viston is not offering 74 cents a share because they think the tech is worth 78 cents a share today, they know through the money they spent on research and DD that the tech is worth well over $1 today and several dollars within a year or two or there is no way they would take this chance!,2021-10-30T16:01:52Z
$PQEFF there are definitely shill accounts working for Viston United on almost every social platform already. and there will probably be way way more when Viston realizes that we aren&#39;t rushing to take the deal. I&#39;d recommend giving them hell and embarrassing them. that&#39;s just me though.,2021-10-30T15:53:47Z

$PQEFF It‚Äôs almost laughable, Gear Energy is a tiny Canadian Oil &amp; Gas producer with about 12-15 million reserves of oil and that company has a market cap of $200M, and we are trying to give away 85 million barrels of reserves plus 85 million tons of clean future sand plus 5% royalties on worldwide production of oil sands for 420M euro because this buyer is telling us our company can‚Äôt make a go of commercializing this tech,2021-10-30T14:19:26Z

$PQEFF Here is a fun little mind game, obviously there are so many factors in determining a company‚Äôs value such as total assets and operating income etc, but just for fun here are some major oil players and their oil reserves estimates, Cenovus market cap $20B with reserves of 5B barrels, BP market cap $85B with reserves of 10.7B barrels, Royal Dutch Shell market cap $135B with reserves of 8.2B barrels, Exxon market cap $242B with reserves of 9B barrels, and the creme dela creme Petroteq market cap $100M as in Million with reserves (once validated as per the FEED study as proven reserves that can be extracted) of around 86M barrels on current leased lands and likely access through additional leases or licensing of estimated 14-25B barrels in all of Utah oil sands), of the majors above the low end (Cenovus) is 4x reserves to MC would put PQE at (86M x 4) $344M MC or about 63 cents per share, but in the high end (Exxon) at a 26x puts PQE at (86M x 26) $2.236B MC or $4.10 per share!,2021-10-30T13:53:54Z
