$PQEFF When they ask you to Tender,2021-12-18T04:58:36Z
$PQEFF any word on what the hangup is with TSE listing and how if it can be resolved. The stock uncertainty would be easier to stomach if this wasn&#39;t screwed up,2021-12-18T04:27:58Z
$PQEFF  
&gt;no one cared who I was ‚Äôtil I purchased the shares 
&gt;If I tendered those shares will you die? 
&gt;it would be extremely painful‚Ä¶ 
&gt;you‚Äôre a big shareholder 
&gt;for you 
‚Ä¶ 
&gt;was refusing a 1032% premium part of your plan? 
&gt;Of course! 
‚Ä¶ 
&gt;Dr. Bailey refused Viston‚Äòs offer in favour of dilution, we had to find out what Haywood told him 
‚Ä¶ 
&gt;well congratulations you ruined the buyout! now what‚Äòs the next step of your master plan?

$PQEFF btw, how can they have 0 revenues in their 10-k (not counting the licensing fee which is the accounts payable and might never materialize)? Didn&#39;t they claim to have sold a bit of oil and sand in June? So either they lied about that or fucked up yet another financial filing. 

Also 4 million general and administrative is insane for a company that does nothing.,2021-12-18T01:01:10Z

$PQEFF management and Haywood are oking for strategic relationships and a superior financial option  for shareholders.

Haywood dropping their valuation and financial report soon.

If management can&#39;t deliver, they will give us time to tender.

Not complicated..,2021-12-17T22:56:35Z
$PQEFF Let&#39;s assume Petroteq, together with Haywood, would issue 323M shares at e.g. 9 cents, receiving $29M (minus $3M finder fee) to pay off any debt and fund the start of some bullshit construction on their new land. This would increase the share count by about 50%. Could Viston just reduce the offer accordingly and say, okay our offer is capped at C$600M and we pay per share, whatever the share count will be on Feb 7th? Or can&#39;t they do it and would have to cancel the offer? Does anyone know, if it is that easy to kill the Viston offer and get the share price back to single digits?,2021-12-17T21:44:50Z

$PQEFF cheap again so I bought some more with other profits. They can all be tendered unless I get a better offer beforehand. If only I could 4x my money every 2 months.,2021-12-17T19:04:19Z

With that offer already on the table, this really does fall under the millionaire maker category right now. How is the market so blind to not see this?

$PQEFF ok nevertender crowd, please explain something to me. You think not tendering is the better option. Tendering gets you X4 in less than 2 months and you think the alternative is even better. Why don&#39;t you all have pawned off your belongings and collected a cut throat loan from every loanshark in your vicinity? Why are we at 13 cents if some die hard Management fanboys should currently be risking their organs to maximize their leverage in a stock that has only 70 million market cap, including the shares owned by Valkor, blyumkin, people who will tender etc.? Something is not adding up here.,2021-12-17T18:03:14Z

$PQEFF I‚Äôm not tendering. Just saying,2021-12-17T16:57:06Z
$PQEFF looking forward to 4 things...
1 Proper Haywood Valuation.

2 Haywood financial report.

3 Management&#39;s recommendations.

$PQEFF Tanking...back to under .13, does not look like a stock with a real buyout offer,2021-12-17T16:33:08Z
$PQEFF,2021-12-17T15:46:53Z
$PQEFF Why are hedge funds passing on what looks like a 500% gain in less than 2 months?  Yes, if the buyout doesn&#39;t happen this drops say 8 cents, but if it goes ahead that&#39;s a 45 cent appreciation.

Can&#39;t see any risks of shareholders not tendering.  There must be 50% ready to tender regardless of what Haywood or the board has to say.

On the Viston side, I don&#39;t believe the offer can be withdrawn unless  there is a material adverse change.  Nothing has happened there.  I do wonder why Viston is offering such a massive premium but the premium was even bigger when this offer was first made in Germany and maybe they really see such an attractive offer as worthwhile to get the technology.  Proof of funds is apparently in place, and good financial and legal advisors are involved.

Yet the whales do not buy-in at 13 cents.  What am I missing? Asking for a friend.,2021-12-17T15:23:06Z
$PQEFF This stock is looking like a dead fish. Even starting to smell. I am still holding but standing close to the door.,2021-12-17T14:41:50Z
$VSQTF How many companies on the OTC paid you 3 dividends this year? As of close today all VSQTF holders will be entitled to the $FNTTF dividend üíµ. 

I feel bad for all the clowns that are trying to get rich quick on the triple 0 plays with billions and billions of OS, horrible balance sheets riddled with toxic debt, and business models that are destined to fail.

Imagine investing in a company that had more assets on hand per dollar you invest than Berkshire Hathaway and Blackrock ü§£. I can explain it to you, I can&#39;t understand it for you.
