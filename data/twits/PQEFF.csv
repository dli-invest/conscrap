$PQEFF Just an example of the terms the company had to offer for some cash as recently as April 21 in order to get some cash as detailed in the recent &quot;Shares for debt&quot; exchange announced 
 
&quot;The convertible promissory note issued on April 21, 2021 that had an original principal amount of US$92,125 (including a ‚Äé‚Äé10% original issue discount) with a purchase price of US$83,750, has been amended to (i) clarify that only the purchase price (US$83,750) shall be convertible, (ii) fix the conversion price at US$0.048 (the market price on April 21, 2021), and (iii) ‚Äérestrict the payments of interest, fees or other amounts under or in ‚Äérelation to the note at a maximum of 24% per annum&quot; 
 
Holy Bejeasus! less than 5 cents a share and paying double digit interest, just back in the Spring.  Show me the 60 dang cent buyout and take my shares, Ya&#39;ll greedy holdouts are rolling the dice on a company scraping bottom,2021-11-29T03:33:51Z

$PQEFF this might actually gap up a little tomorrow, seeing as how all the tsx issues have been satisfied. People might want to grab some before the flood gates open up north ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,2021-11-29T00:51:06Z
$PQEFF nothing has changed as far as Im concerned,2021-11-28T21:55:27Z
$PQEFF was bullish now I‚Äôm not sure how to feel about this stock, what do you guys expect this week holds?,2021-11-28T21:47:40Z
$PQEFF up or down for a while is why you stay diversified... still an easy long hold.,2021-11-28T19:44:20Z
$PQEFF Even though Viston would have to act on PQE&#39;s debt in the case of a successful takeover, the conversion still strikes me as a poison pill, albeit a pretty small one. However, acquiring the company just got a bit more expensive.,2021-11-28T19:00:02Z
$PQEFF What do we make of this? &quot;The ‚Äéforegoing securities will be issued in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the United ‚ÄéStates Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &quot;U.S. Securities Act&quot;), and applicable state securities laws, and ‚Äéwill be issued as &quot;restricted securities&quot; (as defined in Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act). In addition, the ‚Äésecurities issuable pursuant to the transactions noted herein will be subject to a Canadian four-month hold ‚Äéperiod‚Äù The 4,529,166 common shares are restricted and have a four month hold period. This puts it past the buyout date of February 07, 2022.,2021-11-28T15:06:56Z
$PQEFF 4 month lockup on shares issued, in this particular situation there probably won‚Äôt be a big sell off. May actually maintain upward momentum in the coming weeks,2021-11-28T05:05:44Z
$PQEFF Tonight&#39;s PR could mean more progress with the exchange than I thought.  The amended notes referred to in tonight&#39;s PR (April 21, May 20, July 2) are the only 3 outstanding unconverted notes mentioned in the Oct 6 PR.  All other notes mentioned in the Oct 6 PR have been converted, repaid, or issued with exchange approval.,2021-11-28T04:16:49Z
$PQEFF What I want to know now is how many non-compliant unconverted notes still have to be amended and upon amendment of all such notes will the company have satisfied the exchange.,2021-11-28T01:13:41Z
$PQEFF  No one likes to see dilution but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s the major takeaway here.  It&#39;s only 4M shares issued under an existing note which is less than 1% of os shares.  It&#39;s the amendments to the unconverted notes that caught my attention.,2021-11-28T01:10:41Z
$PQEFF Could this actually be... dare I say it....progress? Maybe partial satisfaction of conditions set by the exchange to lift the halt?  They&#39;re doing retro amendments of pre-halt unconverted notes to being coversion prices in line with exchange requirements.  This is pretty much all they can do to comply with the exchange&#39;s conversion price policy at this point, other than to pay a fine.,2021-11-28T01:04:50Z
$PQEFF so how much does this fall on monday as a result of the dilution? This is why i keep telling people to tender,2021-11-28T00:52:25Z

$PQEFF is the board ever gonna make a recommendation? Is been 3 weeks since they said they make no recommendation.  Valuation not done yet.  I can&#39;t wait for January.  A company that wants to maintain control fights for it.  These guys just chillin.,2021-11-27T23:04:56Z
$PQEFF is it February yet?,2021-11-27T21:28:27Z
$PQEFF Over a month since the official offer now. Many more months since the first offer in Germany. Since then management has not managed to get the stock unhalted, has not managed to secure financing for a plant or sell any licenses, and has not managed to get whatever is missing to run the existing test plant at highly lucrative margins despite getting several millions of dollars through warrant conversions. It has been months and there is no indication they have done anything other than calling Haywood (which should take about one afternoon to discuss, being generous, and an hour to do) to provide a valuation we still haven&#39;t gotten either. Someone please explain to me how this is possible unless one or several of these clowns are on Viston&#39;s payroll.,2021-11-27T18:37:54Z
