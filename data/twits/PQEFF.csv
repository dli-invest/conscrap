$PQEFF A bit more overall volume. Steady daily short sale volume around 30%. There&#39;s been a lot of discussion, bear talk, and angst here the past week, but I&#39;m pretty chill, I must say. Steady as we go... Have a good weekend.,2021-12-11T00:06:56Z

$PQEFF For all those blaming management for this whole process you better check your facts. From the management letter to shareholders Nov 6, 2021 sent by Shorecrest, &quot;The Viston offer was unsolicited and potentially very opportunistic and it was made by Viston without the benefit of due diligence or ANY NEGOTIATIONS with Petroteq&quot; also &quot;Petroteq attempted to engage Viston for a friendly transaction ... however Viston elected not to engage with the board&quot;,2021-12-10T18:31:05Z
$PQEFF so i was wondering why they have an undisclosed impairment charge. If you read this report they told the epa they are dismantling the plant. Seems strange one would do that if you are working to find people to license your tech. Seeing is believing in the world of oil and gas. 

&quot;The current Petroteq facility is a demonstration plant. Petroteq has no intention of running the current plant unless investors want to see it operate, and they plan to keep the plant until the end of the year (2021). The plant has not operated since July 2021 except for drying sand. From May-July 2021, Valkor processed 980 cubic yards of tar sand ore. Petroteq/Valkor is not interested in mining at this mine site anymor&quot;

&quot;Valkor stated that they plan to start dismantling the plant next year (2022)&quot;

$PQEFF they gave you a sniff by letting the SP go up to .22 to get you all excited.  Now their manipulating the SP down to make the buyout look much more appealing.  Keep it simple and read between the lines.  Keep your emotions in check.  This will be a monster in few years.  Just sayin,2021-12-10T18:17:29Z
$PQEFF tsx response:

Thank you for your email dated December 9, 2021 addressed to TSX Venture Exchange (the &quot;Exchange&quot;) with respect to Petroteq Energy Inc. (the &quot;Company&quot;).

The Exchange would like to acknowledge that the Company is currently under review; however, at present, the Company has not yet met Exchange requirements in order to have its securities reinstated for trading. Only once the Company has satisfied Exchange requirements, will the Exchange issue a bulletin to reinstate the Company&#39;s securities to trading.,2021-12-10T18:07:20Z
$PQEFF 4 weeks since the last twitter post as well. Guess they lost the last employee who wasn&#39;t too geriatric to understand the concept of social media.,2021-12-10T17:55:14Z
$PQEFF let it bleed. Who cares. Buy more and get more if you have the cheddar. 

Viston wants it, the deal is absolutely real. Im still hopeful Bailey will pull a rabbit from a hat tho,2021-12-10T16:49:15Z
$PQEFF stop talking like they have to do something because they don‚Äôt.  They have the prize that everyone wants it will want.  STFU all impatient flippers.,2021-12-10T15:54:34Z

$PQEFF Little doubt in my mind that Pqeff is being manipulated and it gets on my nerves. Very offputting for any investor irrespective if they are considering investing, or those who are already holding. I was told 3 weeks ago that PQE had supplied the latest information TMX had requested, is it the case that they are making an example of PQE? Or just flexing their muscles? We all know the management are not up to the task, and Viston know this hence their comments. Gone on far too long and PQE need to get on the ball and sort it out. I also heard that the valuation actually started in October and not the November as PQE stated. Came from same source who told us of the hostile bid before it was officially announced.,2021-12-10T15:30:48Z

$PQEFF A ton of shares being loaded in mid .12&#39;s this week.  They are holding it down to load, then they will run it.,2021-12-10T14:52:03Z
$PQEFF Low volume (less than 1% of shares), tons of FUD on message boards, ambiguous timeline for catalysts (Haywood report due soon, TSX trading halt pending, alternative transactions potential), make this a prime candidate for manipulation in my opinion, be careful out there https://www.griproom.com/fun/10-signs-your-stock-is-being-manipulated,2021-12-10T14:12:31Z
$PQEFF stop the nonsense, management or the board doesn‚Äôt decide ‚Äúif the deal goes through‚Äù, shareholders do, the board can recommend the buyout and the majority of shareholders don‚Äôt tender the shares then the buyout will not go through, likewise they can recommend not tendering buy more than 50% tender and the deal goes through. The board has to get us a third party valuation (Haywood) then make a RECOMMENDATION and potentially provide an alternative transaction buy in the end shareholders decide with each of their own shares if they tender or not,2021-12-10T13:56:08Z

This is now the biggest bargain on the market. It is literally like free money at this price
