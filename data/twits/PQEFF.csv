$PQEFF Anybody know if TD Ameritrade will direct deposit? And how to go about accepting the offer through them if so? Thanks!,2022-01-05T05:27:06Z
$PQEFF so will we all who tender our shares recieve this &quot;Letter of transmittal&quot; in the mail? And upon filling it out and returning it, receive a check in the mail, unless over $25 million, as stated in the schedule 14D-9 ?,2022-01-05T04:03:15Z

$PQEFF what happens to your shares , if you don&#39;t take the offer and the company goes private. Do you get bought out at a certain price?,2022-01-05T02:15:04Z
$PQEFF One item Petroteq does want to clarify is that as of the date of this Supplement, there are 44,116,827 Common Shares reserved for issuance under outstanding convertible securities of Petroteq. This is materially different from the number disclosed in the Annual Financial Statements, being 118,391,331 Common Shares as at August 31, 2021, which difference is as a result of recent conversion and exchanges of convertible securities.

Wow, that&#39;s way down now... and that&#39;s a good thing!,2022-01-05T02:02:24Z
$VSQTF Eventually people are gonna catch on. Idk what it&#39;s gonna take. The financials are impeccable, the subsidiaries are incredible, the share structure is beautiful, CEO and team are fluid, dynamic, current, and most importantly HONEST AND PUNCTUAL.

The stock market is nothing more than a game where money transfers from the impatient to the patient. What did we learn from $PQEFF and $DPLS? You do your DD, you block out the noise, and you LOAD THE FUCKING BOAT. Ask anyone, if you could go back in time I imagine every single person reading this would sell their house and their first born to get more of those .008 DPLS shares or .045 PQEFF shares.

The story people don&#39;t tell you is that DPLS was down 80% from local highs before ripping 2000%. PQEFF was down 90% from ATH before ripping 1000% on the buy out offer.

VSQTF is down 75% from ATH... When you know, you know, ya know? Happy new year everyone. I hope 2022 is a blessing for all of you.,2022-01-05T01:27:12Z
$PQEFF anyone using E*Trade? I tried calling today several times  to tender my shares but every time I called they said it was at least a 2 hr wait time to speak to someone. Is there another way to do it using that platform?,2022-01-05T01:20:47Z
$PQEFF need weaker dollar Feb 7 th.,2022-01-05T01:09:34Z
$PQEFF now we pray for a weaker dollar against CAD lol,2022-01-05T00:52:11Z
$PQEFF many of the ST followers here speculated that Bailey +bod must have had the Haywood report before now (or the last couple weeks). Some kept insisting otherwise.  Now the clearly disclose they&#39;ve had the recommendation since Dec 10. 

Thats par for the course with this team
I wish them all well in retirement. 

From supplement today
On December 10, 2021, Haywood presented its findings and analysis to the Petroteq Board, and based on a review of a number of strategic alternatives, its valuation of Petroteq, and any potential upside in continuing to operate and grow Petroteq&#39;s business organically, recommended that the Viston Offer be accepted,2022-01-05T00:51:02Z
$PQEFF what happens to shares that aren‚Äôt tendered if the deal does go through? Are outstanding shares bought at 59c?,2022-01-05T00:50:05Z
$PQEFF long story short, Gowlings‚Äô association, PQE‚Äôs blessing, and many other factors give as much confidence as we can hope for for this deal. 

Fuck yea peeps! What a ride.,2022-01-05T00:48:11Z
$PQEFF are we drinking,2022-01-05T00:27:46Z
$PQEFF So I got off the line with Shorecrest about 3 hours ago - I had a few questions. 
 
First - Petroteq recommending shareholders to take the offer lends no validity to the offer itself. At the end of the day, we still need to reach the conditions of the offer and then Viston needs to accept said offer. So, nothing has really changed from yesterday to today other than Petroteq suggesting we take the offer. 
 
I asked about Petroteq and Haywood&#39;s DD into the offer and the representative, Lee, told me that they worked with what they had but frankly if Viston doesn&#39;t want to share information, they can&#39;t do anything about it. 
 
Put simply, the ball is now in Viston&#39;s court, so if you trust the process, this is good as gold. She organically brought up that if this offer was to make a market, lawsuits would follow.,2022-01-05T00:25:04Z

$PQEFF you guys better be buying the dip tomorrow if it happens, that&#39;s thr tweet,2022-01-04T23:52:45Z
$PQEFF OK, sorry. 

Question...if 51% tender, does it go thru immediately or does it go thru on Feb 7th? 

Basically, if wait 2 weeks, what is the downside?...

Someone explain this like I am 12. I tried to get specifics, but I&#39;m missing it.

Thank You!!!,2022-01-04T23:42:07Z
$PQEFF As of the price at the close today, there‚Äôs still 50% gain on the table to get to the tender offer price. I‚Äôm sifting thru my investment accounts looking for another ticker that has a near-guaranteed 50% gain over the next 5 weeks, can‚Äôt find one.,2022-01-04T23:07:34Z
$PQEFF well done folks... I all I wanted  for everyone to make a lot of money.,2022-01-04T23:06:16Z
$PQEFF is there an urgency to tender? It won&#39;t go through sooner then February, right?,2022-01-04T23:03:32Z
$PQEFF Actual footage of the OGs after close,2022-01-04T22:54:39Z
$PQEFF OK, so, the first paragraph. Is it guaranteed when you tender? That is what it says, correct???,2022-01-04T22:49:39Z
$PQEFF thank you to all the nice people here! Hope i&#39;ll See you from February on in some Other discussions!,2022-01-04T22:41:11Z
$PQEFF Looks like interactive brokers is about to get on the program, in response to my ticket they write 
 
&quot;Dear Mr. x,  
 
Thank you for your patience. It appears the corporate action is set up in our system and waiting for final manager approval. Once it is approved, you will be able to make the election under the corporate action manager tool.
