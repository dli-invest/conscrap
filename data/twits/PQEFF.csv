$PQEFF so what happens to price when shorts cover on closing this deal,,2022-01-08T19:29:56Z
$VSQTF Easily 10x bagger. Years from now 100x bagger. Best long term hold on the OTC  based on every measurable metric that I value.

$110 million NAV, set to double every 3-5 years.

Take 6 minutes and watch the interview and you will see why. Market cap currently $20 million. More assets on hand for every $1 you invest than $BRK.A

$PQEFF seeking alpha chimes in late

$PQEFF And remember too, Zbigniew Roch is the said President of Viston. But Viston is not to be confused with his heavy involvement with the European Business Club and Nobel Prize nominated professor Bohdan of Ecologic Earth Energy. He&#39;s head of the Viston M&amp;A shell for transactional purposes.

Much more leverage can be used for negotiations without revealing the identity of the bidder. Such tactic seem to actually work, as Bailey admits, disregarding the offer would be an awful blow to loyal SHs after many years, and the reason the BOD ultimately decided to recommend to tender shares. Again, many will believe this is too far in the conspiracy realm, but the offer has already been made, the BOD has recommended accepting it, and why not guess whose behind the curtain? Just for fun.,2022-01-08T05:08:53Z
$PQEFF so many will say its a stretch but I find it considerably coincidental. The term &quot;Viston&quot; seems generic enough, almost to the point I thought I&#39;ve once even heard the term before. However, after completing a significant term search in TESS and translations across German, Swedish, and Dutch languages, the word is actually not common at all. I believe some believe Viston is acting on behalf of a major oil player, a theory I tend to believe.  

The closest term I found to Viston was &quot;Vistone&quot;, which is registered by ExxonMobil and used by them for the past 25 years as a tradename in the USPTO TESS database category of &quot;..chemical additives, namely synthetic fluids used to improve the quality of oil&quot;. The term was also registered in Brussels through the EUIPO (European Union Intellectual Property Office) .,2022-01-08T05:04:31Z

$PQEFF ok so we have an amazing close for the week, expect more upside next week and the following until tender date. See ya&#39;ll on the other side,2022-01-07T21:03:22Z
$PQEFF nice flag forming 4 day pattern and volume has dropped from 30 million down to 3m next leg up ?,2022-01-07T20:54:34Z
$PQEFF tendered. May still buy a few here and there still for tendering while prices are still so far below offer price.,2022-01-07T20:46:55Z
$PQEFF been here since $0.11. Nice stock. Hoping for $EEENF to be next. Never know about $SRMX either. Could be a sleeper!,2022-01-07T20:38:19Z

$PQEFF 5.6m on ask?,2022-01-07T20:13:27Z
$PQEFF So I reached out to Kingsdale to ask if Viston was planning to release any additional PR prior to the Feb 7 deadline now that the BOD has recommended accepting the offer. The response was that they would if a superior offer was presented prior to the deadline that would require a rebuttal or counter for those to consider who tendered and those yet to tender. 

Obviously wasn&#39;t expecting much information, even if they do indeed have plans for new PR, wouldn&#39;t necessarily expect them to make that known. However, it did appear they were being quite apprehensive of releasing new PR until the risk of counter offer had come and gone, i.e. when the Feb 7 deadline expires,2022-01-07T19:31:01Z
$PQEFF would a statement ever come out when 50%+ has been achieved and the deal is 100% going to happen?,2022-01-07T19:08:40Z
$PQEFF finally tendered today,2022-01-07T18:56:34Z
$PQEFF Another day towards pay day, not long now!,2022-01-07T18:34:25Z
$PQEFF Low Volume is likely to continue now, as many shares in the trading float have been bought up and tendered, thus they are not available for trading.  With the absence of any updates on the offer, I expect we will continue to see slow volume,  and a slow rise upwards as the prospect of a substantial profit in just a month will keep investor buying as the time until payout shortens.,2022-01-07T18:32:28Z
$DTGI With the new addition of SkyNet DTGI expects its subsidiaries to do $18.5 million in annual revenue, SkyNet accounting for a 20% increase.

Market cap $15 million and uplisting to Nasdaq under the ticker NXGY will be confirmed soon. 

No brainer value play

$PQEFF If you tender your shares and the deal does not go through, does  your money for your tender shares just show back up in your account at the price the day of tender or the current stock price, which will likely have dropped significantly in price.,2022-01-07T17:41:09Z
$PQEFF My German broker (Flatex) told me just now, that I am only eligible to Tender PQE shares that I bought before 23 November (this is the date they advised me about the offer). This is complete BS, isn’t it?? I doubled my investment since then.. any thoughts or similar cases? 

Here is the full response (translated from
German to English via Google)
++++++++
The offer that was placed in your document archive on November 23, 2021 can currently only be accepted for securities that were already in your securities account at the time. The cash compensation offer will not be taken into account for items that you bought at a later date.

Mr. Xxxxx, you can currently accept the offer for the 100,000 pieces that you bought before November 23, 2021. At the moment, we cannot tell you whether a new offer will be posted for the other pieces.

If the offer has been accepted, cancellation is no longer possible. You can view and initiate this in your order book at any time.,2022-01-07T17:34:59Z
