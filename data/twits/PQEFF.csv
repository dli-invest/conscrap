$PQEFF one more week üôèüôèüôè,2022-02-01T03:56:13Z
$PQEFF  just offered my minuscule 2k in shares ü•≥ü§û,2022-02-01T01:51:45Z
$PQEFF 

So, if they do not get enough shares before the deadline, they will make another offer and this time they will pay $0.79 US.,2022-02-01T00:30:15Z
$PQEFF does Valkor intend to tender?,2022-02-01T00:01:35Z
$PQEFF countdown anyone?,2022-01-31T23:17:46Z
$PQEFF does anyone know how many shares the new CEO/patent holder has?

I lost the photo that showed % ownership.,2022-01-31T23:13:03Z
$PQEFF Eliminate the noise,  Petroteq&#39;s patented technology is golden. Either right now or later. Kind regards &amp; good luck to all. Cheers,2022-01-31T23:11:58Z
$PQEFF I called Questrade on Friday to tender and the rep asked for the expiry date so I said Feb 7. Today I got this email saying they will submit my shares on expiry day. Is that normal? Or will that be too late. Scared.,2022-01-31T22:23:14Z

$PQEFF Legit question on the mechanics of a tender. What happens to shares that ARE NOT tendered and what happens to the share price of un-tendered shares. Wouldn&#39;t they eventually have to rise to the offer price. Does the saying &quot;a tide lifts all boats&quot; apply here? Thanks all!,2022-01-31T20:59:20Z
$PQEFF tendered my 156k already with fidelity‚Ä¶.anyone have an idea as to why/how it‚Äôs still sitting at .39 one week out from deadline?,2022-01-31T20:14:20Z
$PQEFF Just tendered my remaining 77k shares on Fidelity.  Good luck all,2022-01-31T20:11:55Z
$PQEFF tendered today. QT told me 3-10 days to process, hopefully it‚Äôs closer to 3. Anyone  that has experience with QT how long did it take to process?,2022-01-31T20:07:44Z
$PQEFF sold enough to cover my initial investment. Tendered the remaining 1.2mil shares. Cheers!!,2022-01-31T18:51:09Z
$PQEFF Can someone pls answer this for me ? I don‚Äôt have more funds coming in until March 1 which is after the deadline. Let‚Äôs say shares are still $0.40 then, if I buy shares then what happens? Can I still tender to receive $0.50? Sorry I‚Äôve never experienced a tender/takeover before pls advise,2022-01-31T18:25:31Z

$PQEFF Tendered my 64451 shares today.,2022-01-31T18:02:20Z
$PQEFF have not tendered shares,2022-01-31T17:44:38Z
$PQEFF Tendered my shares.  Number of shares was a lot.,2022-01-31T17:41:39Z
$PQEFF Such an interesting time.  Many of you may be like me, mostly saved from the worst effects of market correction by having a lot locked up in PQEFF.  
So now we are only a week out and like kids waiting for Santa to bring us a bike, the waiting is palpable.  
 
and particularly since it seems like a sort of binary outcome 
 
A week from now we&#39;ll either be informed of a significant financial boon or a brutal rogering disappointment

$PQEFF Canceled my sell order at 0.64 CAD and tendered my 80k shares. Hopefully this goes through!,2022-01-31T17:08:10Z
$PQEFF Tendered my little pile of 225k shares. Good luck team!

$PQEFF should we expect the stock price to go up the last week prior to the tender deadline or stay flat lined, any thoughts? Assuming it stays flat, it makes a better tender case!,2022-01-31T15:16:25Z
$PQEFF ,2022-01-31T14:53:37Z
$PQEFF should I drop another 12k into this‚Ä¶I still have time ü•∫üò¨,2022-01-31T12:44:28Z
$PQEFF I guess the most important line is &quot;The Company has not entered into a written employment agreement with [the interim CEO/CFO]&quot;. Sounds like a &quot;we are appointing some caretakers so we don&#39;t get fined&quot; type deal and they fully expect the takeover to go through.,2022-01-31T11:39:26Z
$PQEFF just filed with the SEC a Event for Officers and a Financial Exhibit https://last10k.com/sec-filings/pqeff/0001062993-22-001794.htm?utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=forum&amp;utm_campaign=8K&amp;utm_term=pqeff,2022-01-31T11:09:54Z
