Tender 10Q is garbage.,2022-01-20T01:59:52Z
$PQEFF â€¦â€¦The Company continues to work with the TSXV on a reinstatement of trading and will update the market as things progress. However, the TSXV has indicated that these matters and their review of the Transactions may take some time to resolve and that a reinstatement to trading is not expected in the near termâ€¦â€¦â€¦.      To Tender is the only way out for everyone to get out of this play. I think.,2022-01-20T01:32:39Z
$PQEFF any one here tendered through Wealthsimple Canada???,2022-01-20T01:04:48Z
$PQEFF Company just filed their 10Q.  I don&#39;t know how anyone could read it and not run, not walk, to tender their shares.  It&#39;s the buyout offer that makes this company worthwhile. Without it, OMG, beyond hi risk and in trouble,2022-01-19T23:27:38Z

$PQEFF another day done,2022-01-19T21:19:24Z
$PQEFF actually I donâ€™t understand if you donâ€™t tender, you buy shares in mind that the risk/profit ratio is high, for now I think 85-90% the deal will go trough, why would someone hold and bet against it in mind that the chance that it might go higher than the offer is like 5% and asking what will happen when the offer is expired? Risk/profit isnâ€™t worth it in this case if you donâ€™t tender!ðŸ¤”,2022-01-19T20:47:40Z
$PQEFF tender, tender, tender and more tender.. just tender your shares and make the profit!!!!! The sooner the better and once they have 50+1 % than itâ€™s a final deal. You have that profit and if anything would go wrong than it will go back to .10 again cause we still canâ€™t trade snd who knows how long until we do.  The risk is huge at this point,2022-01-19T20:15:29Z

Sold my total position for the outstanding offer of 0,74 CAD. Profit is profit!,2022-01-19T20:04:23Z
