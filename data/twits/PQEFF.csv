$PQEFF The Haywood report needs to come out sooner than later before PQEFF drops too low.  It would be better for PQEFF to springboard off the news starting at .22 rather then .12.  Too much of the &#39;good news fuel&#39; will be eaten up trying to make up lost ground rather than launching to new highs.  LFG with the report guys.,2021-12-07T04:11:15Z
$PQEFF For those that think that Viston will withdraw from the offer because of the constant dilution of shares - think again.

They have made it clear from the beginning that they are expecting the company to dilute and the prices to plunge (exactly what is happening now),2021-12-07T02:13:10Z
$PQEFF Patent game changing technology, that&#39;s why I invested way before any hostile takeover offers appeared. Think some here may have forgotten that fact.  Anyways... good luck to all with your trading. I&#39;m investing, Cheers,2021-12-07T01:17:15Z
$PQEFF come February and SP is 0.20 or less, what is the real case for not tendering to collect 3X for anyone, including the whales? I don’t wanna hear it COULD be $1 or 2 in 5 years as that is a horrible bet if u up 3X or more instantly and wanna hold out. I understand the tech and potential future of it. Who will get it to mass market use?,2021-12-07T01:12:37Z
$PQEFF At the current share price, the market is predicting that there is a 20% chance the Viston offer goes through:  20% * $0.60 = $0.12 (and this would also assume that PQEFF has nil residual value without the offer which would also be very pessimistic).  Never seen anything like this before. 
I think the chance of this deal is far better than 20%.  Viston&#39;s original offer in Germany was made when the share price was even lower.  Viston has consistently been comfortable with a $0.60 buyout.  I am not aware of any material adverse event since that first offer was made so I&#39;m not expecting the offer gets pulled or lowered.  As people have recognized, a lot has already been spent on the offer and reputations are on the line if Viston does not follow through.
I couldn&#39;t care less about Haywood.  Valuing a company with no cash flow or past performance will be so heavily based on sketchy assumptions as to have no value.  The only value is from the Viston offer.  Two months and counting...,2021-12-07T00:39:10Z
$PQEFF Did my post get removed because people think I&#39;m spreading FUD? It was a legitimate thread you can&#39;t deny this price movement and situation is stressful to say the least with very little certainty in either direction. 
 
I still am holding my position so it&#39;s not like I&#39;m a bear with a short position.,2021-12-07T00:26:10Z
$PQEFF Get this Haywood report out now or let&#39;s see a bidding war develop.  Now.  Not later.  NOW.,2021-12-06T22:30:29Z
$PQEFF Hindsight will be 20/20 of course but if we can actually get 74 cents in Feb this is a once in a lifetime wealth generating opportunity.  I am taking full advantage.  I just hope it doesn&#39;t turn out to be a once in a lifetime wealth destroying opportunity (that I took full advantage of lol),2021-12-06T21:59:57Z
$PQEFF lmfao at this level you either fold or diamond hand it. I&#39;ll hold.,2021-12-06T21:32:35Z
$PQEFF Also today was a recovery day by and large so no blaming this on general conditions.  I wonder if last week&#39;s farce of a licensing agreement was procured by Haywood.,2021-12-06T21:32:19Z

$PQEFF you know that petroteq moves heavy, when something might happen. The chart to me says, prepare for the next leg up.,2021-12-06T20:17:45Z

$PQEFF  boys I’ve re entered,2021-12-06T19:13:41Z
$PQEFF WTF is going on with this drift down???  This is looking more and more like some criminal manipulation.  Speaking to my law firm today.,2021-12-06T19:05:05Z
$PQEFF Isn&#39;t this now trading at a pre-offer level?   How embarassing for management.  The bed has been shat.,2021-12-06T19:04:00Z
$PQEFF Where is PQMillions with his words of wisdom? we are in trying times and need it,2021-12-06T19:01:54Z

$PQEFF why did Bailey leave Exxon?,2021-12-06T18:54:07Z
$PQEFF doesn&#39;t anyone have an accurate float #? I&#39;m imagining it&#39;s relatively low,2021-12-06T18:33:48Z
$PQEFF It&#39;s honestly weird. Under normal circumstances Viston PR people would probably be getting huge bonuses for shifting the sentiment towards making the offer succesfull (because I remember it not being that way a couple months ago). Let&#39;s just appreciate how useless management is to achieve the same effect without spending a dollar on PR or putting out a single communication since the offer.,2021-12-06T18:15:26Z
$PQEFF So moffdogg mentioned the World Petroleum Congress being held in Houston this week. https://www.23wpchouston.com/ 
This is a BIG deal for anyone wanting to meet key oil players from all over the world. First time it is being held in USA in over 30 years.  Let&#39;s Go Dr Bailey. If you cant find any interest in Houston this week just go a head and hang it up,2021-12-06T18:04:13Z
$PQEFF So I called Etrade and they said since I bought after the original tender offer,  I had to call the company directly.  Called Kingsdale advisors and they said that Etrade should do the tender.   Anyone else in this boat?,2021-12-06T17:32:28Z
$PQEFF huh I can see live price on my Swedish broker for the first time since halt hmmmm,2021-12-06T17:30:50Z
$PQEFF I warned u fools, but keep listening to that pumper PQMillions,2021-12-06T17:29:53Z
$PQEFF hmmm, appears to be some manipulation going on here to bring the SP down so the offer looks better.  I’m not buying it but I’m buying more.,2021-12-06T16:39:52Z
