$PQEFF I tendered my shares with Fidelity today. I heard someone say you can trade your shares after they are tendered and with Fidelity that is not true, they are escrowed.,2022-02-15T00:32:50Z
$PQEFF I tendered my shares Friday with Ameritrade.  
If any of you with Ameritrade are waiting until to the last minute to tender, be aware that they will tender as late as the day before the close date but not of the day of the close date.,2022-02-15T00:26:00Z
$PQEFF so is there a way to tell how many shares have been tendered?,2022-02-14T23:54:52Z
$PQEFF just filed with the SEC a Regulated Disclosure https://last10k.com/sec-filings/pqeff/0001062993-22-004204.htm?utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=forum&amp;utm_campaign=8K&amp;utm_term=pqeff,2022-02-14T21:51:43Z

Trouble is in order to get the 5,000 b/d plant we would end up with a couple billion shares + outstanding. Viston offer is fantastic at over 400 mil and the bod agrees.,2022-02-14T21:01:20Z

$PQEFF weird- I called my broker (fidelity) to tender out my shares on Friday; they did so with journal entries and put the shares into a tender account (&quot;PETROTEQ ENERGY INC COM NPV TENDER FOR....&quot;  However, today, the shares are back into PQEFF....,2022-02-14T20:16:01Z
$PQEFF 

I think most here don&#39;t really understand the valuation. 

It proves that the technology is far more valuable, especially considering they only accounted for 5,000 barrels per day production

The future potential is huge.  5,000 barrels a day is just the next step.  We&#39;re talking millions of barrels in reserves, billions and trillions in Utah and the world.

“Peak Value IP&#39;s valuation study of Petroteq&#39;s CORT indicated a fair market value (FMV) ranging from $229 Million to $326 Million. The analysis of investment value (IV) ranging from $598 Million to $850 Million. The analysis has also considered a proposed production facility to be operated in Utah that will produce 5,000 barrels of oil per day.”

We trade the future on the stock market, not the present,2022-02-14T19:12:01Z
$PQEFF this deal will go through, now its just a percentage games. the price will not change much from current levels cos they want pple to tender (vs selling) so they can get 90%+.  
if ur waiting for a price spike to sell, it will not happen, to get the gain YOU MUST TENDER.,2022-02-14T19:07:41Z
$PQEFF It would be nice to know what happened with the CFIUS review which should have finished on Friday.  That&#39;s the last hurdle besides needing a majority to tender.,2022-02-14T18:50:42Z
$PQEFF I’m gonna miss this board.,2022-02-14T17:47:45Z
$PQEFF Droolers:  
 
There&#39;s other buyers out there! [Haywood report must be lying] 
The tech is worth more! [3rd party valuation says.... not so fast] 
MGMT can get financing! [MGMT: Leaves the company] 
 
Is it 2/28 yet?,2022-02-14T17:28:05Z
$PQEFF my take on the PR is that they released it to make the Viston offer more attractive.

If they tell us a third party evaluation is 2/3 what the current offer is, how could anyone possibly rationalize maintaining the status quo? We couldn’t, so we’d tender.

IMO this was released to help the deal go through. Any thoughts?,2022-02-14T16:47:48Z
$PQEFF Some of you are way too emotional to be investing.  Petroteq releases a valuation that puts the Viston offer above the FMV, but below the IV.  Then, they add this: 
 
&quot;The Peak Value IP report re-affirms to our shareholders the substantial value of the company’s underlying assets and intellectual property rights...and should provide a commercial viability to financial parties to advance.” 
 
They&#39;re flat out telling you &quot;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;re all winning!  You, us, Viston.  We&#39;re all winners!&quot;   
 
But many of you are so emotional and negative that you&#39;re angry, or whiny, or worried.   
 
Tender and get paid, that&#39;s a given.  However, some of you may want to hand this money off to a professional, because your emotion is going to cost you at some point,2022-02-14T15:39:30Z
$PQEFF Bought the morning mini-dip for my LAST batch of shares; tendering again Wednesday. Forgive me, my RECAF brothers and sisters, as I did sell some shares to fund this last buy. No worries, buying back up next month. 

Let the PQEFF SP action do whatever it will do, but let’s get this buyout done!,2022-02-14T15:24:44Z
$PQEFF if you are not tendering you are crazy. The new valuation is lower than the offer.,2022-02-14T14:50:21Z

$PQEFF  When I see updates like that incredibly dilutive and useless one we just read, I have to remind myself that Viston has seen this stuff already so it&#39;s not poison pill material and once this deal goes through I won&#39;t be subjected to the all the stuff that would make this a dismal investment, not because of the tech but all the shares and financing and what it would take to do anything with it all,2022-02-13T13:13:03Z
