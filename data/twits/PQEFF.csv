$PQEFF By my blind count, there have been over 2.5 billion (with a ‚Äòb‚Äô) shares tendered so far! 

What‚Äôs that you say? There are only 646 million shares outstanding? Yes, I know! And that‚Äôs what makes this tendering response so unreal!

Tender your shares asap so we can reach the golden level of 5 billion shares tendered!,2022-01-31T05:16:11Z
$PQEFF do you guys think we have enough tenders to make the deal happen?,2022-01-31T04:09:56Z

$PQEFF - Petroteq Energy exotic insider transaction‚Ä¶ https://www.macroaxis.com/invest/story/PQEFF/23214905/Petroteq-Energy-exotic-insider-transaction-detected #insidertrading #stocks #fintechnews,2022-01-30T19:13:02Z
$PQEFF so we tender,then how many days before we get cash ,If deal closes schwab told me the deal has to close first,which makes sense, but it could takes months like other stocks I tender before an they never close in 1 week,2022-01-30T18:02:46Z
$PQEFF If you want to stay invested in the technology you could invest in Tomco Energy (code: TOM), listed on the LSE on the AIM market, they have a multi-site licence from Petroteq for the USA, i.e. they can build as many plants they want in the USA and just need to pay 5% of the revenue to Petroteq. The market cap is only $13m. Obviously they have to find the money to build the plants. I can&#39;t give a whole rundown on it, you will have to research it, but it could be worth looking at. I am a shareholder in TOM.,2022-01-30T17:51:08Z
$PQEFF I bought this stock when whoever it was stuck his finger in the sand and said ‚Äú Hey! I think there‚Äôs oil in here! That gives me an idea!‚Äù 
And although it appears we‚Äôre all about to make some money part of me is disappointed this take over happened at all. I really believe in the potenial of the technology and wanted to stay  with it. For years. Any ideas by the many wise of you how we can still do that? Regardless many thanks to all of you for the very sage advice you given. I‚Äôll miss this stock and all of you fellow tenderers now sadly looking at number, like a toe tag in a morgue, when PUEFF used to be. Happy Trails to you all 
of you.,2022-01-30T15:55:26Z

$PQEFF If I buy Monday morning through my RBC direct investing account, can I call the right away to tender? Or do I have to wait for the settlement date, which is usually 48 hrs later.,2022-01-30T09:51:50Z
$PQEFF  Is it 50/50, 75/25, 90/10‚Ä¶chance that one will get 50% return 6 trading days from now? That is the question. I believe I‚Äôm in 50/50 camp since I haven‚Äôt added since the announcement.,2022-01-30T02:02:16Z
$PQEFF  I&#39;m not inclined to chicken out on the way-too-many shares I&#39;ve tendered, but the payout can&#39;t come soon enough for me.  My real concern is that it looks the buyers are closely tied to Ukraine which is about to be invade. Nothing is more disruptive than that.  
One can say &quot;they have the money reserved&quot; etc, but I think it&#39;s all whistling past a graveyard.  Of course it&#39;s a political risk at play, but then again, we&#39;re almost home,2022-01-30T00:09:09Z

$PQEFF question for the masses who tendered using E*Trade:
I tendered earlier this week.. but I still see the stock listed in my portfolio.
How does it show in your E*Trade account‚Ä¶.
Will E*Trade ‚Äúlock‚Äù them at some point?,2022-01-29T12:56:56Z

With all the additional buying and tendering being reported here, it seems like sellers are cashing out for a guaranteed .39 USD, while the buyers are tendering for the potential .59 USD, which helps the offer become a self fulfilling prophecy.,2022-01-28T21:25:22Z

If you do not tender and the deal goes through the stock may trade for a few more days then at some point be delisted. Your shares will be in limbo at this point until all legal requirements for the acquisition are met. This could take several weeks or months. Then your broker will be contacted and you will receive new stock ( if acquiring company is a public company) or cash, equivalent to the tender price in your account.,2022-01-28T19:49:46Z
