$PQEFF Haywood valuation and financial report will be ready shortly.

Management and Haywood are working on a better offer for shareholders.  These things take time and diligence. 

Management will have a PR soon. If they don&#39;t deliver a better offer for shareholders, they will give us plenty of time to tender.

Anyone trying to scare you or rush your decision before you have all the proper information  is a fraud.,2021-12-20T03:45:41Z
$PQEFF just say no to tendering your shares,2021-12-20T03:14:01Z
$PQEFF Hey guys, really appreciate the discussion here.  I welcome @tall_investor&#39;s critical thinking as Reddit Forums, Yahoo Conversations and Stocktwits are often chock full of obvious nonsense.  Although relatively new to the stock I&#39;m not sure I agree with the pump and dump thesis, but I certainly wouldn&#39;t rule it out. Lawrence Livermore&#39;s century old book on investing relates that even back then, most of what you heard or thought was going on in the market was a manipulation of some kind. He cites instance after instance where the majority thought one thing and he another, which was how he retired with a fortune. My main question is this: if this technology is proven to work,  it should be worth an incredible amount of money. Like an absurd amount. At LEAST $5/share. If I were Shell or BP or whoever  I wouldn&#39;t be effing around with a small offer in fear that one of the other Big Boys would make a better offer and steal my lunch. I&#39;d just make a decent offer and move on.,2021-12-20T01:34:11Z
$PQEFF I am not downing the stock. I have been a stockholder for several years but BS is BS. Time to end the fluff and come with the stuff. I have 1.7m shares, so I am also looking for a good payday. Management is not available or non responsive to their stockholders. I intend to take the current offer soon.,2021-12-20T00:11:33Z
$PQEFF the only reason why people are tendering shares already is because of the silence from the management. The sell off and the negative sentiment falls squarely on management, let‚Äôs not sugar coat that. WTF has management ever done for the benefit of the shareholders? I hear crickets. So we shouldn‚Äôt blame people for tendering their shares. The reason people are tendering is because people are losing patience. I‚Äôm waiting until next month to tender, but I will tender, management isn‚Äôt going to do anything and it‚Äôs obvious.,2021-12-19T23:18:13Z
$PQEFF I‚Äôll be the first to admit I am paranoid and skeptical about this. I don‚Äôt know if I would call it bearish seeing as I have a position.

The difference is I don‚Äôt launch as hominem attacks - I merely ask why permabulls feel so confident when evidence seems to fly in the face of their beliefs.

These boards need some rationality. There are like 3 people on here who are skeptics and already they are drowned out.

The more overly optimistic the board is, the more scared I get. People are banned from the subreddit for having anything but the most positive of sentiments towards PQE which is insane.,2021-12-19T23:01:44Z
$PQEFF  is the 0.74 share buy out still on the table? Looking to take a small position for a quick flip...before shares are officially tendered and at these prices its a steal,2021-12-19T22:27:47Z
$PQEFF everyone on this board is paranoid of bears living under one‚Äôs bed üòÇüòÇüòÇ,2021-12-19T22:15:08Z
$PQEFF bears are working hard this weekend. They&#39;re desperate...

Haywood&#39;s proper valuation and financial report coming shortly.

Management and Haywood are working hard on finding shareholders a better financial option and strategic relationship.

Haywood will have to increase their share price.

PR will be coming  soon.,2021-12-19T16:09:05Z
$PQEFF I read through the loan agreement between Uniexpress and Viston, the former providing the latter with the 420Mn Euros. 
 
The filing states that if Viston opts to not draw on the debt (which it won&#39;t until Feb 7th, assuming the deal is even done), the loan is voided and Viston has to pay Uniexpress fees that are capped at $100,000 (e.g., filing and survey fees).  
 
Loan payments are made in quarterly and start 3 months after the first draw on the loan. The loan was ratified October 22nd, 2021, and again, we can assume the loan hasn&#39;t been drawn upon as why would it be until the tender date. 
 
So, basically Viston&#39;s &quot;proof of funds&quot; is money borrowed from another entity that basically cost them $100,000 to flaunt as well as the $46K filing fee they paid to the SEC for this whole situation. 
 
$146K to make a market to sell shares into for old holders.

$PQEFF we‚Äôre all going to be making bags of money in the new year, let‚Äòs not get worked up about the specifics for now, I reckon it‚Äôs all speculation until the 11th hour with this stock anyway‚Ä¶  spend that energy to cultivate good Christmas cheer, merriment, mirth and charity this season.,2021-12-19T06:37:55Z
$PQEFF does anyone actually  know or have any info on this viston company, and if it is a legit co and even has the resources to actually come up with 500m?? I looked online and couldn&#39;t find much on the company at all. It would such if this was all just a scam.,2021-12-19T00:37:48Z
$PQEFF You guys ever think maybe the board already has the Haywood report but they aren‚Äôt releasing it yet until Haywood lines up a second buyer? Haywood may have given them the report saying PQE is worth $1 now but $3 in 2 years but told the board they need a few more weeks to market a deal with another party? The board may not want to release the report until they have a second option because so many retail shareholders are saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what the valuation says if there is not a better option I am tendering my shares right away because they have had long enough and I am impatient‚Äù, just a thought,2021-12-18T22:02:05Z
$PQEFF ‚Äúwho is this king dibs guy?‚Äù Who are any of you? Lol do you guys meet up for weekly meetings or something? Anyways I‚Äôve been here for months and No I don‚Äôt work for management. But I will not be tendering my shares and neither should you.,2021-12-18T20:31:25Z

$PQEFF when bears attack your stock on the weekends... it&#39;s a great stock and multiple bears and new bears are a good buying indicator.

Bears are buyers.,2021-12-18T14:59:30Z
$PQEFF Lets see now; thats 400m for the stock that has rights to an oil soaked sand pile and a tech that will require an additional 150m to get into production. How much sky can we expect to sell?,2021-12-18T14:05:45Z
$PQEFF the silence on Twitter compared to months ago is telling, since the TO plenty of weeks have passed to garner lots of negative bearish sentiment and ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenarios that all result from waiting, if we weren‚Äôt waiting would this still be true? Haha, it‚Äôs setting up so perfectly, a PR will drop and many just didn‚Äôt want to take the investment risk but will wish they did, and will later rationalize how low risk it was and why they fooled themselves with doubt. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, questioning is good but consistent/constant berating is just a sign of either impatience or bearish manipulation. Anyhow, before Viston offer this was headed down a very promising track, with s/p rallying from Bear all time lows, nothing has changed except Petroteqs name is now on global stage. My only advice is practice patience and don‚Äôt come to Stocktwits for your DD, but sentiment sure both sides are clearly represented. Here are some interesting facts in case you didn‚Äôt already know,2021-12-18T14:03:53Z
$PQEFF Tired of waiting, show me the baby!

$PQEFF not sure where kingdibs has come from with all his no tender memes. Make a bull case for this stock because i think we are all aware of the negatives. And don&#39;t say a major will magically take them over since it hasn&#39;t happened to date and by the way they are handing out licenses for free (not one cent till a plant is constructed and a nominal 2 million dollars at that point). In the meantime, the stock has been diluted to shit, the company has no revenue, the cfo and coo were fired and quit, the stock has been halted for months in Canada, there is an unreported impairment, they hired an ibanker which has provided no report after many week, ceo is over 80, i can keep going.,2021-12-18T05:50:54Z
$PQEFF When they ask you to Tender,2021-12-18T04:58:36Z
$PQEFF any word on what the hangup is with TSE listing and how if it can be resolved. The stock uncertainty would be easier to stomach if this wasn&#39;t screwed up,2021-12-18T04:27:58Z
$PQEFF  
&gt;no one cared who I was ‚Äôtil I purchased the shares 
&gt;If I tendered those shares will you die? 
&gt;it would be extremely painful‚Ä¶ 
&gt;you‚Äôre a big shareholder 
&gt;for you 
‚Ä¶ 
&gt;was refusing a 1032% premium part of your plan? 
&gt;Of course! 
‚Ä¶ 
&gt;Dr. Bailey refused Viston‚Äòs offer in favour of dilution, we had to find out what Haywood told him 
‚Ä¶ 
&gt;well congratulations you ruined the buyout! now what‚Äòs the next step of your master plan? 
&gt;crashing this stock‚Ä¶

$PQEFF haywood?,2021-12-18T01:08:02Z
$PQEFF btw, how can they have 0 revenues in their 10-k (not counting the licensing fee which is the accounts payable and might never materialize)? Didn&#39;t they claim to have sold a bit of oil and sand in June? So either they lied about that or fucked up yet another financial filing. 

Also 4 million general and administrative is insane for a company that does nothing.,2021-12-18T01:01:10Z
$PQEFF Weebles might wobble ... ~30.8% today, after a bigger short day yesterday. Have a good weekend, all!,2021-12-17T23:44:48Z
