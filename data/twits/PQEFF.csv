$PQEFF The buyout is going thru oil is now over $80,2022-01-07T03:39:46Z
$PQEFF $PQEFF I got around to reading that supplement to the directors circular.  The two most interesting things I learnt is that all of the directors and officers have confirmed they are going to tender their shares, and that the number of convertible securities went down from 118 million to 44 million common shares as of the end of December.  I reckon Valkor will tender all of their shares too since all the top guys at Petroteq are going with it.  I‚Äôm pretty bullish about the offer going through, but after reading about all the possible risks I won‚Äôt be surprised if the open market share price doesn‚Äôt break into the 50‚Äôs on account of all the mystery surrounding Viston, and whether they are 100% good for funds and all.  
 
Why did Viston beat around the bush for all those months with the German only offer anyway, I guess there‚Äôs some things us small fry will never know.,2022-01-07T01:33:56Z

$PQEFF let&#39;s get it,2022-01-06T21:29:41Z
$PQEFF lots of strong support at $0.345. Why wouldn‚Äôt it be when you can nearly double your money there, will break through $0.40 resistance soon and find new support, if you are considering arbitrage now is the time to buy, the dip is telling that many are ready with cash to take advantage of this offer,2022-01-06T20:12:31Z
$PQEFF lots if green candles toward the end of the day....manipulation down to buy cheap shares?,2022-01-06T20:08:52Z

$PQEFF Easiest play ever,2022-01-06T19:43:00Z
$GTII I think I may have found the next $OSTK I like the set up better than any other play, and this Bitcoin Dividend being paid in 69 days is going to force brokerages to transfer the shares which $BTCS  is going to pay for. They are doing this because their are only 5.7 million shares on the float, and yesterday 65 million shares were traded after the announcement. Someone has been shorting this since it was on the OTC and they continued to short it after the uplist to the Nasdaq from $30 down to $3.

The Bividend is going to force any naked short to cover, and the micro float combined with zero debt and zero dilution for the next 69 days means this is a black swan event. Keep in mind the market cap is only $45 millon 

I don&#39;t call for these types of plays ever. It&#39;s not my thing. But as far as I know I&#39;m the only one that has put the pieces together, or at least the only person being vocal about it.

$PQEFF $DPLS My 20x plays of 2021 heed my call. Go long. üíµüíµüíµüíµ,2022-01-06T19:25:02Z

$PQEFF Of course the market will play games with ‚Äòeasy money‚Äô,2022-01-06T18:59:31Z
$PQEFF so I tendered my shares on Charles Schwab. Call them. They will direct you to a different department. Tell them the ticker and that you want to tender. The shares will be removed at that point and put into some form of a hold. I was told that by the 7th at the latest we would know the final vote and if it‚Äôs goes through they will then deposit the equivalent amount of cash in your account.,2022-01-06T18:54:58Z
$PQEFF drop this baby back down again, please! I‚Äôm loaded and ready!,2022-01-06T18:49:46Z
$PQEFF I think it‚Äôs people selling to take their profit in hopes to drop it further. Reinvest during the panic sell and make more. It‚Äôs smart ü§∑,2022-01-06T18:43:51Z
$PQEFF average up again. Thank you,2022-01-06T18:43:41Z

$PQEFF told you guys. Otc traders are dumb lol,2022-01-06T18:42:35Z
$PQEFF panic selling to secure profits or someone knows something. 

Good buying opportunity though. Could double your money,2022-01-06T18:40:54Z

$PQEFF Has anyone tendered through TD EasyWeb in Canada? Tried  the toll number, then picked direct corporate action. But they couldn&#39;t find my account. They told me to try 1-800-465-5463, been on hold for 60 minutes.,2022-01-06T18:14:37Z
