$PQEFF I&#39;ve never been involved in a buy out before can anyone here tell me what effect other people tendering has on the float and the relative price of the stock? It seems like tendering would reduce available shares and by extension raise the,2021-11-30T23:05:22Z
$PQEFF so working off ivo&#39;s thoughts. The COO just quit. Replaced by CTO. The new CFO is a part timer. The CEO is 80üò≥. Sure seems like they are setting themselves up to either sell or fail. I hope it is the prior!!!,2021-11-30T22:10:30Z

The audit of the Company‚Äôs annual financial statements for the year ended August 31, 2021 has not yet been completed. This is primarily due to two factors. First, there has been a recent change in the CFO position. Second, there is potentially a material impairment charge on the Company‚Äôs initial oil extraction plant. The Company is still in the process of confirming and quantifying this impairment charge.,2021-11-30T21:52:16Z

$PQEFF Remember guys actions speak louder than words, what company doesn&#39;t back fill a critical function in a company with someone new such as a COO? A company who is either getting bought out or a company going out of business. Petroteq is definitely not going out of business if they have plans to create new plants and acquire more sand. They can&#39;t announce that they are going to be sold until it&#39;s official, but if executives are leaving, and they aren&#39;t hiring new people to replace them, there&#39;s a reason for it. Talk is cheap, but read between the lines,2021-11-30T21:39:22Z
$PQEFF I mean if they take the offer it&#39;s bullish and if they don&#39;t still bullish because they know they are worth a lot more which I agree. Can&#39;t lose position.,2021-11-30T21:24:08Z
$PQEFF The only thing I hate about this ticker is the paper hands here. Like they have an offer of .60 per share but you&#39;ll settle for .16. Shit doesn&#39;t make any sense ü§£ü§£,2021-11-30T21:15:24Z

$PQEFF I see the announcement for the new COO is just the existing CTO this is a good sign that they aren&#39;t hiring a new person and that executives are leaving the company, this is an indicator that it&#39;s getting bought out people!,2021-11-30T21:07:56Z
