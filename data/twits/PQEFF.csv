The Big companies see it. But most retail investors still don&#39;t realize how early it is. Latest Paul Thomas video where he called it very cheap a few weeks ago $COP

$PQEFF Everyone read RobRit&#39;s post below.  I think he nailed it.  There is a big company (most likely big oil) behind the Viston bid and they are trying to grab Petroteq for CHEAP.  Fuck them.  They are going to pay a fair price.  Spread the word.,2021-11-05T23:08:54Z
$PQEFF slow response HAS to be Bailey and co waiting on some 3rd party valuation to release in addition with news of new financing plan. 

Hope y&#39;all have a good weekend, let&#39;s come back to some big News on Monday, yeah?,2021-11-05T22:05:25Z
$PQEFF this is a big smear theater here. one of the big oil companies is behind the offers. These offers are made official through small, inconspicuous companies. One thing is for sure, the curtain will soon fall and the shares won&#39;t be sold below $ 3.,2021-11-05T21:29:42Z
$PQEFF To all who wants to tender, what would you do if BOD issue another 500 million shares and SP tanks even before trading starts? Would you take a loss and run away??,2021-11-05T21:23:49Z
$PQEFF I think a lot more action and volume be coming in on Monday. GLTA. Have a great weekend.,2021-11-05T21:12:57Z
$PQEFF Monday is big day. Could go anywhere depending on BOD response. What‚Äôs likely in your opinion?
1. &lt;$0.15
2. Less than 10% move.
3. &gt;$0.30,2021-11-05T21:03:10Z
$PQEFF I assume the tender offer only applies to investors pre-offer? What incentives do prospective investors have?,2021-11-05T20:44:34Z
$PQEFF so is everyone here tendering?  If I buy more shares do they get included if I tender,2021-11-05T20:39:19Z

$PQEFF tender and let‚Äôs all get fucking rich,2021-11-05T20:23:00Z
$PQEFF so bod that is going to develop cort technology and licence it all over the world just waits for the last day to inform their beloved investors (as per last bailey‚Äôs letter) that they should not take 3x offer? I used to do smth similar during my uni times,2021-11-05T20:19:30Z
$PQEFF ,2021-11-05T20:16:12Z
$PQEFF Monday can‚Äôt come soon enough.,2021-11-05T20:11:49Z
$PQEFF i will probably be buying more if there isn&#39;t a poison pill on the horizon. A weak response will be indicative to me that the takeover probably will happen. GL to all and have a good weekend.,2021-11-05T20:02:33Z
$PQEFF if they reject Vinson offer, how will SP react?,2021-11-05T20:00:49Z
$PQEFF management and BOD built company and technology. Our CEO Dr Bailey is a former Exxon executive and a chemical engineer.  He knows what he is doing.  Bears and dumb shots can gladly sell shares and move along. ... your volume means nothing.,2021-11-05T19:54:08Z
$PQEFF I think Monday will be the BOD response. Won‚Äôt wait until last day. If they haven‚Äôt already prepared it or have been ready for months, then maybe someone else needs be running the show.,2021-11-05T19:07:58Z
$PQEFF waiting for Board response like:,2021-11-05T18:46:38Z
$PQEFF bears are buyers and all these new folks that are suddenly experts on PQEFF can .

Anybody selling now is dumb. Anybody buying is smart. Keep it simple.,2021-11-05T18:06:55Z
$PQEFF bad mgmt can render a perfectly good product or technology worthless‚Ä¶they are starting to concern me,2021-11-05T17:59:47Z
$PQEFF don&#39;t care about filings.  Only care about offer.  Too many greedy people up in here,2021-11-05T17:54:08Z
$PQEFF sep 28 NR &quot;annual report for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021 is not due until November 29, 2021.&quot;
will filings happen on time given unresolved issues with tsx.v??,2021-11-05T17:38:03Z
$PQEFF just sitting on my shares. Know what you own. Block out the noise,2021-11-05T17:11:57Z
$PQEFF See when you give your opinion to some people?? I just got back from lunch, so just read the comments. No counter-argument, no other ideas, just a lot of name calling and berating. Look that up on your phone to get the definition, I don&#39;t have time to explain, you know who you are.  That&#39;s what you get from some people, GTFOOH, worthless opinion, stupid, etc etc. Meanwhile, bro, just to help you out a little...&quot;your&quot; as in, &quot;your worthless opinion&quot; shows ownership. &quot;You&#39;re&quot;,  as in,  You&#39;re dumber than you are stupid&quot; is a contraction for You are. I wouldn&#39;t have expected you to know that though....By the way, you are in the severe minority here, thinking PQE isn&#39;t going to protect their tech and Viston won&#39;t have anything to buy come February....  Now, you call me dumb and stupid some more so everyone can see how very very smart you are. Along with your friend, the other tool bag..,2021-11-05T16:55:37Z
$PQEFF your stock is not your identity. Your identity is not your stock. This is a business and you are an investor. The only goal is to maximize your personal profit within the bounds of ethical behavior.,2021-11-05T16:32:45Z
