$PQEFF so many scenarios to think about. I&#39;m just glad our disruptive company already has an offer for 60 cents a share from an investor way more sophisticated than me. Gives us an idea what PQ is worth now and a fraction of what Petroteq is worth long term.,2021-11-07T03:20:34Z
$PQEFF one other thing to think about, I can’t confirm 100% but since the TSXV is still halted insiders may not be able to buy or sell (which I think is kinda confirmed by not a single insider filing since the halt started), anyway imagine if Valkor was going to go into a PP before the halt or was planning to buy shares on the market to increase their stake and they have to wait until the halt is lifted, day one of TSXV trading could see 100M shares traded with Valkor buying up 75M, then a few days later when they have to file their purchase everyone realizes what is happening, Valkor could single-handedly bring the stock price above the offer and also gain enough percent of the float to ensure a no vote,2021-11-07T02:58:06Z

$PQEFF Life&#39;s been busy lately. Here&#39;s a quick peek at daily short sale volume this past week. Hope your weekend has been going well!,2021-11-06T21:15:55Z
$PQEFF what happens if there is no Statement until the end of their time limit? What would be the consequences??,2021-11-06T21:08:35Z
$PQEFF the poison pill is to buy a target company some time to hunt for an alternative to a hostile offer. Hostile bidders almost always convince security commission hearing panels to “cease trade” or shut down their poison pills. Trading has already been ceased on the Canadian Exchange as we all know how would a poison pill be instituted trading if trading has been halted? Anybody in this chat from Canada understand why the exchange or the government is not protecting his company ... maybe they will in the future?,2021-11-06T19:33:01Z
$PQEFF If the company takes the poison pill, how does that affect/show the company’s that lent money for shares? 

I would think this would be a reason to avoid that scenario,2021-11-06T18:55:19Z
$PQEFF I don&#39;t know this all seems a bit too easy, something doesn&#39;t feel,2021-11-06T18:39:05Z

$PQEFF I&#39;m not sure if everyone out there playing liars poker but to keep talking about 50 + 1 buy out common shares has anybody really looked at the 10K the offer estimates that approximately 800 million common shares could be said with the offer fully financed at 568 million USD....outstanding common shares on a fully diluted basis. That&#39;s 250 million warrants convertible securities. does anybody think there&#39;s debt holders will not tender seriously. There was a 41 million share Buy and the founder  left with 28 million. Start doing some real math here see if your shares really matter that much,2021-11-06T17:05:14Z
$PQEFF when bears are so desperate they are spreading FUD on weekends, it&#39;s a good buying indicator.

Let&#39;s see what the BOD has to say about our amazing and disruptive technology and current offer.. Go from there seems reasonable.,2021-11-06T16:00:22Z

$PQEFF What is your fair evaluation for this take over? I’m a new investor so I’m good with .60 US and even happier if it gets higher. I know Long term holders know the tech/company better and have other views,2021-11-06T14:11:10Z

$PQEFF Everyone read RobRit&#39;s post below.  I think he nailed it.  There is a big company (most likely big oil) behind the Viston bid and they are trying to grab Petroteq for CHEAP.  Fuck them.  They are going to pay a fair price.  Spread the word.,2021-11-05T23:08:54Z
$PQEFF slow response HAS to be Bailey and co waiting on some 3rd party valuation to release in addition with news of new financing plan. 

Hope y&#39;all have a good weekend, let&#39;s come back to some big News on Monday, yeah?,2021-11-05T22:05:25Z
$PQEFF this is a big smear theater here. one of the big oil companies is behind the offers. These offers are made official through small, inconspicuous companies. One thing is for sure, the curtain will soon fall and the shares won&#39;t be sold below $ 3.,2021-11-05T21:29:42Z
$PQEFF To all who wants to tender, what would you do if BOD issue another 500 million shares and SP tanks even before trading starts? Would you take a loss and run away??,2021-11-05T21:23:49Z
$PQEFF I think a lot more action and volume be coming in on Monday. GLTA. Have a great weekend.,2021-11-05T21:12:57Z
$PQEFF Monday is big day. Could go anywhere depending on BOD response. What’s likely in your opinion?
1. &lt;$0.15
2. Less than 10% move.
3. &gt;$0.30,2021-11-05T21:03:10Z
$PQEFF I assume the tender offer only applies to investors pre-offer? What incentives do prospective investors have?,2021-11-05T20:44:34Z
$PQEFF so is everyone here tendering?  If I buy more shares do they get included if I tender,2021-11-05T20:39:19Z
