$PQEFF Dang, they sending me more mail to tender me shares! I already did, bitches! This one from ShoreCrest Group in Toronto. Do they want me buy more? Lolü§£ü§î,2022-01-24T01:33:34Z
$PQEFF So who pays the Tender price for the shorted shares. If we all tender, where does all the money come from? Just curious!,2022-01-24T00:40:11Z
$PQEFF Does anyone know about the 50+1 condition? I remember reading that 50+1 should be from common shares. What I understood is 50+1 from non-OTC (TSX, FRA),2022-01-24T00:19:35Z
$PQEFF Any Norm Macdonald  fans here?  I found this video and it sums up my feeling of being all in on this stock since the Summer. 
another good Norm quote: &quot;I lost it all a few times. But that&#39;s because I always took the long shot and it never came in. But I still have some time before I cross that river.  And if you&#39;re at the table and you&#39;re rolling them bones, then there&#39;s no money in playing it safe.  You have to take all your chips and put them on double six and watch as every eye goes to you and then to those red dice doing their wild dance and freezing time before finding the cruel green felt.&quot; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0V-C5yr5sg,2022-01-23T21:16:29Z

$PQEFF On Feb 7 they‚Äôll announce the results of the tender, then they have a mandatory 10 days to extend the offer to anyone who hasn‚Äôt tendered. The stock would presumably still be trading over that time correct? As much as the current setup seems like a slam dunk, I‚Äôll be curious what the SP is during that window. It should obviously be at just under the tender price, but this hasn‚Äôt been behaving in the most logical way so far. I‚Äôll be curious for sure!,2022-01-23T17:57:38Z
$PQEFF two weeks left‚Ä¶

It doesn&#39;t get easier the fewer days there are left until the deal.,2022-01-23T17:23:54Z

When is the US going to do this?,2022-01-23T02:21:30Z
$PQEFF So if I&#39;m holding PQEFF and the buyout goes through, Do I simply get USD in my US brokers account and pay US capital gains taxes or is there any kind of issues with the money having been paid out in canadian dollars.  (had Canadian withholding on canadian stock dividends before although that&#39;s another issue),2022-01-23T01:12:51Z

$PQEFF I hope the wife does not log into our fidelity account until I pull this off, I went in a little bigger than we planned. She won&#39;t care when I get her new fencing ordered the 2nd week of February.  After 30 yrs of marriage, surprises are good right?,2022-01-22T19:55:38Z
$PQEFF when I said in august I was gonna make a million off this üëÄ 43 cents where u at,2022-01-22T19:53:56Z

$PQEFF is there AH on OTC?,2022-01-22T16:34:24Z
$PQEFF I‚Äôm one 5k share purchase away from the half million mark. Yes, the order is in the system. February can‚Äôt come soon enough.,2022-01-22T03:46:05Z
$PQEFF You wonder if the market takes a sh t, how will the stock hold up?,2022-01-22T02:05:38Z
$PQEFF For giggles, the daily short sale volume here this past week. 

Have a good weekend, all! We&#39;re getting closer.,2022-01-21T23:01:27Z
$PQEFF This money is really gonna help to buy the dip in this shit market,2022-01-21T22:53:19Z
$PQEFF just the amount of people in contact with Kingsdale - literally every retail PQE shareholder - tells me this thing goes through. Imagine if it fell apart how many pissed off calls and emails they would have to deal with? How many threats of lawsuits and even if they had no merit their names would be dragged through the mud as scammers. Their phone lines would be jammed for all their clients for weeks. 

They are putting out this personal touch trying to recruit people because this thing is definitely going through and they are trying to get 100% right now not 50%. I got my third call from them today. THIRD. I finally gave in and told them I‚Äôm tendering now so they leave me alone lol.,2022-01-21T22:48:54Z
$PQEFF I have a feeling it‚Äôs going to be one of those situations like when you bet big on an NFL game and are anxious to hell about it. Then your team is up 31-0 at half time and you‚Äôre thinking to yourself ‚Äúdamn that was easy and not dramatic at all, I should have put more money in‚Äù. Viston will probably have 75% of the shares and the tender goes off without a hitch by February 7 and all of us will be looking at each other almost confused like ‚Äúwell, that was easy‚Äù.,2022-01-21T22:42:23Z
$PQEFF Indeed, could be serendipitous to have a bunch of future cash sheltered from the market during this red market days in our tendered share.  Hope these financial times don&#39;t affect the ability of the buyer to complete the deal,2022-01-21T20:53:44Z
$PQEFF I must admit that with this rate, I won‚Äôt be surprised if Viston gets 90% of shares. GLTA‚Ä¶,2022-01-21T20:47:45Z
$PQEFF i love this stock. look at the market lol,2022-01-21T20:32:42Z
$PQEFF Finally tendered. Been in this one for a while. Would say I am sad to see it go but I would be lying. üòÅ lets get this money,2022-01-21T19:09:08Z
$PQEFF  My 2nd batch of shares just filled. I did notice on my corporate action page with Fidelity this statement.                                
  &quot;Ontario Inc. offers to purchase, all of the issued and outstanding common       
shares of Petroteq Energy Inc. at a purchase price of CAD 0.74&quot; who is Ontario inc? I found this listing for a waste company? &quot;Ontario Inc is located in North York, ON, Canada and is part of the Remediation and Other Waste Management Services Industry&quot;                          https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-profiles.2355294_ontario_inc.63fb3bf9b5a51f5ad966ffe144ae4fe6.html,2022-01-21T18:51:08Z
