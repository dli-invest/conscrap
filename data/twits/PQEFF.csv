$PQEFF Can we assume that Valkor and other major shareholders are tendering their shares given the board‚Äôs recommendation?

A few of these holders can sway the direction of the tender so I‚Äôd be interested to hear what these companies‚Äô perspectives are on the offer, if they‚Äôve made them public.,2022-01-12T03:20:55Z

Been a while since I&#39;ve been here.  Seems like the sentiment of most is to tender shares, correct?,2022-01-12T03:00:07Z

$PQEFF  Question for Metas, PQE and other heavy hitters here...and by the way...thank you so very much for all of your insights and great advice!!  Question is...can shares bought on margin be tendered?   (Asking for a friend ü§£üòÖü§£),2022-01-12T01:57:55Z

$PQEFF for people who tendered through TD.. does it show anywhere that updated status? I called last week to tender but I don‚Äôt see any status change on the account. just wondering,2022-01-11T13:50:49Z
$PQEFF I am happy for the longs here that made a lot of money, so many of these penny stock buyouts are borderline scams and never happen. Of course this one looks legitimate and the buyout will happen very soon.,2022-01-11T13:45:58Z
