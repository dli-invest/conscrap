$PQEFF does anyone actually  know or have any info on this viston company, and if it is a legit co and even has the resources to actually come up with 500m?? I looked online and couldn&#39;t find much on the company at all. It would such if this was all just a scam.,2021-12-19T00:37:48Z
$PQEFF You guys ever think maybe the board already has the Haywood report but they aren’t releasing it yet until Haywood lines up a second buyer? Haywood may have given them the report saying PQE is worth $1 now but $3 in 2 years but told the board they need a few more weeks to market a deal with another party? The board may not want to release the report until they have a second option because so many retail shareholders are saying, “I don’t care what the valuation says if there is not a better option I am tendering my shares right away because they have had long enough and I am impatient”, just a thought,2021-12-18T22:02:05Z
$PQEFF “who is this king dibs guy?” Who are any of you? Lol do you guys meet up for weekly meetings or something? Anyways I’ve been here for months and No I don’t work for management. But I will not be tendering my shares and neither should you.,2021-12-18T20:31:25Z

$PQEFF when bears attack your stock on the weekends... it&#39;s a great stock and multiple bears and new bears are a good buying indicator.

Bears are buyers.,2021-12-18T14:59:30Z
$PQEFF Lets see now; thats 400m for the stock that has rights to an oil soaked sand pile and a tech that will require an additional 150m to get into production. How much sky can we expect to sell?,2021-12-18T14:05:45Z
$PQEFF the silence on Twitter compared to months ago is telling, since the TO plenty of weeks have passed to garner lots of negative bearish sentiment and “what if” scenarios that all result from waiting, if we weren’t waiting would this still be true? Haha, it’s setting up so perfectly, a PR will drop and many just didn’t want to take the investment risk but will wish they did, and will later rationalize how low risk it was and why they fooled themselves with doubt. Don’t get me wrong, questioning is good but consistent/constant berating is just a sign of either impatience or bearish manipulation. Anyhow, before Viston offer this was headed down a very promising track, with s/p rallying from Bear all time lows, nothing has changed except Petroteqs name is now on global stage. My only advice is practice patience and don’t come to Stocktwits for your DD, but sentiment sure both sides are clearly represented. Here are some interesting facts in case you didn’t already know,2021-12-18T14:03:53Z

$PQEFF not sure where kingdibs has come from with all his no tender memes. Make a bull case for this stock because i think we are all aware of the negatives. And don&#39;t say a major will magically take them over since it hasn&#39;t happened to date and by the way they are handing out licenses for free (not one cent till a plant is constructed and a nominal 2 million dollars at that point). In the meantime, the stock has been diluted to shit, the company has no revenue, the cfo and coo were fired and quit, the stock has been halted for months in Canada, there is an unreported impairment, they hired an ibanker which has provided no report after many week, ceo is over 80, i can keep going.,2021-12-18T05:50:54Z

$PQEFF any word on what the hangup is with TSE listing and how if it can be resolved. The stock uncertainty would be easier to stomach if this wasn&#39;t screwed up,2021-12-18T04:27:58Z
$PQEFF  
&gt;no one cared who I was ’til I purchased the shares 
&gt;If I tendered those shares will you die? 
&gt;it would be extremely painful… 
&gt;you’re a big shareholder 
&gt;for you 
… 
&gt;was refusing a 1032% premium part of your plan? 
&gt;Of course! 
… 
&gt;Dr. Bailey refused Viston‘s offer in favour of dilution, we had to find out what Haywood told him 
… 
&gt;well congratulations you ruined the buyout! now what‘s the next step of your master plan? 
&gt;crashing this stock…

$PQEFF btw, how can they have 0 revenues in their 10-k (not counting the licensing fee which is the accounts payable and might never materialize)? Didn&#39;t they claim to have sold a bit of oil and sand in June? So either they lied about that or fucked up yet another financial filing. 

Also 4 million general and administrative is insane for a company that does nothing.,2021-12-18T01:01:10Z

$PQEFF management and Haywood are oking for strategic relationships and a superior financial option  for shareholders.

Haywood dropping their valuation and financial report soon.

If management can&#39;t deliver, they will give us time to tender.

Not complicated..,2021-12-17T22:56:35Z
$PQEFF Let&#39;s assume Petroteq, together with Haywood, would issue 323M shares at e.g. 9 cents, receiving $29M (minus $3M finder fee) to pay off any debt and fund the start of some bullshit construction on their new land. This would increase the share count by about 50%. Could Viston just reduce the offer accordingly and say, okay our offer is capped at C$600M and we pay per share, whatever the share count will be on Feb 7th? Or can&#39;t they do it and would have to cancel the offer? Does anyone know, if it is that easy to kill the Viston offer and get the share price back to single digits?,2021-12-17T21:44:50Z

$PQEFF cheap again so I bought some more with other profits. They can all be tendered unless I get a better offer beforehand. If only I could 4x my money every 2 months.,2021-12-17T19:04:19Z

With that offer already on the table, this really does fall under the millionaire maker category right now. How is the market so blind to not see this?

$PQEFF ok nevertender crowd, please explain something to me. You think not tendering is the better option. Tendering gets you X4 in less than 2 months and you think the alternative is even better. Why don&#39;t you all have pawned off your belongings and collected a cut throat loan from every loanshark in your vicinity? Why are we at 13 cents if some die hard Management fanboys should currently be risking their organs to maximize their leverage in a stock that has only 70 million market cap, including the shares owned by Valkor, blyumkin, people who will tender etc.? Something is not adding up here.,2021-12-17T18:03:14Z
