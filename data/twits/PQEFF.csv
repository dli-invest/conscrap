$PQEFF never underestimate viston leadership. Itâ€™s not even German or Swiss. Zbigniew roch is a polish selfmade. A shell for sure. But who is behind him? Turkey ? Russia ? Who knows,2022-01-16T01:17:49Z
$PQEFF I am checking in, any news yet?,2022-01-16T00:27:56Z
$PQEFF We&#39;re all just waiting a very long short time til Feb 7th and checking in here to make sure nobody has posting any dreadful change in the meantime,2022-01-16T00:16:20Z
$PQEFF block party!!!,2022-01-15T23:58:17Z
$PQEFF clowns need attention. Hereâ€™s your attention ðŸ¤¡,2022-01-15T22:28:11Z

$PQEFF,2022-01-15T20:40:18Z
$PQEFF And people here are saying that I&#39;m an idiot and a clown but the price is moving down if everything looks so good the price would be moving up and I don&#39;t attack people on the internet that are posting from behind a keyboard or a cell phone I think it&#39;s just spreading hate, I just try to stay with the facts,2022-01-15T20:29:42Z
$PQEFF I haven&#39;t dealt with too many buyouts with over-the-counter bulletin board, but my general experience is anything under $5 you have to be very very very careful,2022-01-15T20:27:18Z
$PQEFF to me the OTC bulletin board is like a lottery, every once in a while, people make a ton of money on them, but most people lose  most of their money  if they try to invest, but day trading or swing trading  is okay, and if nobody won big once in a while nobody would play the game,2022-01-15T20:20:46Z
$PQEFF I doubt everything in pennyland, even now the price is moving down you would think it&#39;d be moving up,2022-01-15T20:16:53Z
$PQEFF your an idiot!  That is all.

$PQEFF anyone knows why Valkor isn&#39;t in the list?,2022-01-15T16:39:42Z
$PQEFF ole eric1960â€¦ what are you trying to accomplish right now? This is a weird flex so late in the game.,2022-01-15T16:31:08Z
$PQEFF Something to ponder (slide 10: &quot;...application of low greenhouse gas intensity in situ oil sands recovery/process improvements&quot;)

$PQEFF I&#39;m neutral on the situation. I&#39;m watching to see what happens and to try to learn by it. 
That is all,2022-01-15T16:00:11Z
$PQEFF Is there any reason why Visteon cannot just go in the open market and buy shares in the 40s cent range and save themselves money? I don&#39;t understand. Honest question.,2022-01-15T15:03:40Z
$PQEFF https://www.petroteqoffer.com/,2022-01-15T14:52:11Z
$PQEFF Looks ok, there is shareholder equity, but they offered a ton of share over the past few years, very very common in Pennyland.,2022-01-15T14:47:21Z
$PQEFF Iâ€™ve been waiting for the fudders to roll in. Iâ€™m surprised it has taken this long. Why you guys wouldnâ€™t do it sooner and get some of these people to sell at a lower price is beyond me. Yâ€™all trying to drop it late in the process, well I hope youâ€™re successful cause Iâ€™m standing by to buy moreâ€¦,2022-01-15T02:56:37Z
$PQEFF This tender better fk&#39;in go through. I&#39;m sitting on a bunch of shares here in Canada but they are still HALTED. If this tender falls through then i&#39;ll still be fk&#39;in stuck here. It better go through. I feel like they should have their 50%+ 1 by now.,2022-01-15T02:43:41Z

Another week gone by and another new all time high hit. More people are discovering Petroteq. Next week will be great again.

$PQEFF this guy Eric  Lolol     Thatâ€™s why you buy it at .40â€¦.cause the company losses money and will be bought out    Buy and tender ðŸ¤¡,2022-01-15T00:59:39Z
$PQEFF I was thinking of buying some of the stock at $0.40 and waiting for the buyout, but when I saw how much money they were losing I decided against it. I hope everything works out for the long here.,2022-01-15T00:41:32Z
$PQEFF take loof at this fud

Was hoping for more action from additional 3rd parties, but I guess today was as good as any to tender my shares... 
Thank you to all the OGS and the DD/ guidance you have provided along the way... my only regret was not having more shares,2022-01-14T21:32:34Z
