$PQEFF depressing, we can produce oil from sand and sell the sand to frac companies, frac sand supply shortage and all time high price and we are 7 trading days away from being sold, so frustrating https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/US-Shale-Production-Hindered-By-Sand-Supply-Crunch.html,2022-02-17T05:40:20Z

$PQEFF Assuming that Putin doesn‚Äôt start WWW III and send currency markets into chaos, the 420M EUR credit facility confirmed by RBOS to be at the ready is much more than enough to cover fully diluted shares of about 795M at .74 CAD and closing costs and Viston exec festivities with the classiest of hoes:

Credit facility 

420,000,000 EUR x 1.444 FX = 606,480,000 CAD

Acquisition cost

0.74 x 795,000,000 = 588,300,000 CAD

Remainder for closing costs / Viston festivities with classy hoes

18,180,000 CAD

So get to tendering.,2022-02-16T21:48:21Z

$PQEFF Oil will be breaking over $100 and PQEFF would have been trading higher than .59 on its own without the offer.  Viston isn&#39;t doing us a favor locking us down at .59 a share.  Oil movement and the winds prevailing are in our favor going forward and Viston knows this.  They saw PQEFF moving up, on its own (up to .25) and they pulled the trigger with a lowball offer and now they capped us at .59 a share.  Garbage.  They need to raise their offer especially considering there are shareholders (like me) who have invested in PQEFF years ago at higher than a $1 per share.  Not taking a loss.,2022-02-16T00:27:27Z

What&#39;s up with these new updates on valuation? Likely stuff that was instructed months ago? People using it now jump to white Knight/2nd bidder conclusions?
If so why so late in the game when they could have done it anytime before now. A second bid days before the tender deadline (actually 23/24th for final broker instruction so even fewer trading days) isn&#39;t going to do much for confidence. That would assume a motive, motive to disrupt Viston and unfortunately us in the process. Further delays, further uncertainty. Why is this particular group pushing this 2nd bid idea and then saying stuff like &quot;read between the lines&quot;  when challenged ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§îü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,2022-02-15T21:23:26Z

 i for one believe everything the bod and interim ceo do in the ordinary course of business is of no consequence and simply fulfill the minimal duties before the expiry date. 

This stuff is in the administrative pipeline, day to day

$PQEFF great disclaimer. Sand btw is everywhere. Literally. It&#39;s more about logistics and who you are selling to. Most companies are using in basin sand so Uinta would be their only market

Broadlands based their economic analysis on information orally conveyed to them and no testing of sands from the Indago Lease has been performed by Broadland or by the Company. 

Broadlands confirmed that they performed their analysis in general accordance with acceptable mineral industry standards, and that technical issues discussed in the Report are in accordance with the standards of Subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K (&quot;SEC S-K 1300&quot;) promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 In particular, Broadlands confirmed that they consider the sands at the Indago Lease to be Material of Economic Interest, as defined in SEC S-K 1300, and that Broadlands is required to expressly note that, as such, there is no assurance that the sands at the Indago Lease will be converted to saleable material.,2022-02-15T16:17:46Z
