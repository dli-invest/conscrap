$PQEFF Hey gang, do your own dd on $RMSL.  I&#39;m not going to pump it.  Just check the facts.,2022-01-13T05:20:54Z
$PQEFF It is my understanding that just because we tendered our stock, it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean the offer is going to go through.  I think Viston could back out of the deal and then, the stock will plummet and could be bought on the open market for pennies on the dollar.   Is my thinking wrong?,2022-01-13T04:53:59Z
$PQEFF once everyone gets their cash from the tender you should look at $RMSL‚Ä¶ hopefully it‚Äôs not too late by then.  I know if it‚Äôs still under .05 yet I‚Äôll be adding my earnings from this.  We‚Äôre only weeks away from an FDA approval.  At least check it out and read some DD.  2022 is the year everyone eats,2022-01-13T04:47:29Z

$PQEFF 
Losing a lot of money. Technology must be worth a lot to the right company 
 
 There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
At August 31, 2021, we had not yet achieved profitable operations, had accumulated losses of $(100,138,592) since our inception and a working capital deficit of $(6,264,427) and expect to incur further losses in the development of our business, all of which casts substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have incurred net losses for the past five years. As at August 31, 2020 and August 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $(90,664,349) and $(78,285,282), respectively and a working capital deficit of $(12,955,134) and $(9,268,763), respectively.,2022-01-13T04:28:28Z
$PQEFF but if they&#39;re tendering the shares already it sounds like a done deal, but I guess this is Penny Land, so anything can happen?,2022-01-13T01:31:52Z
$PQEFF üôÉ,2022-01-13T00:32:34Z
$PQEFF so you can buy the stock tomorrow and tender it or $0.58 or whatever it is, you just have to wait about a month or two, is that correct????,2022-01-13T00:19:00Z
$PQEFF got voicemail last night. Tendered today. Got real person calling me tonight so I answered and told dude I pulled the trigger so all good eh?,2022-01-13T00:11:40Z
$PQEFF Morgan Stanley tendering the remaining 800,000 shares I have with them on Friday.  Tendered my other 200k with TD ameritrade last week.  Bags are packed and ready for 58-59 cents per share.  It was a good run.  Will be plowing a bunch into RECAF and high double digit dividend stocks like FSK and HMLP.A to increase my annual annuity.  11 cent basis so a nice 5 bagger in less than 1 year...no complaints here!,2022-01-12T22:47:18Z
$PQEFF suprising that theres a wall at .43 you think this would continue to climb and trade closer to the tender price.,2022-01-12T22:08:38Z
$PQEFF anyone tendered from Germany,2022-01-12T21:10:09Z
$PQEFF  I tendered my shares about 1 week ago , and it appears tendered on Fidelity website , I received a call from ‚Äú Kongsville advisors‚Äù recommend that I tender ! They left a message for me to call back , anyone had similar experience ?,2022-01-12T20:21:00Z
$PQEFF Tendered my 400k+ shares just now, Fidelity. They show these shares as tendered in my accounts, and have removed their value from my account totals - kinda shocked/scared me when I first saw the reduced totals!,2022-01-12T20:12:32Z
$PQEFF  you guys know you can tender your shares through td and most brokers online? on td just follow the instructions on here https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-tender-shares-in-my-Ameritrade-brokerage-account no need to be on hold on the phone,2022-01-12T19:25:27Z

$PQEFF Tendered today. Called TDA. Took 5 min tops.,2022-01-12T17:47:13Z
$PQEFF Another minor oil stock with green pretensions (but much more scammy in my mind, i&#39;m short via puts) is CEI.  They just had a shareholder vote on expanding authorized shares from 250 million to One billion.  Message board was full of folks saying they voted no.  
and failure to vote was regarded as a no. As many no as yes or more.  
When the vote was finally counted, they indeed got their 50% although it was bit close.   
Remember it&#39;s a vocal minority expressing a protest of no, although in this case people are voting in a huge increase in the share price.  People buying since these recent announcements (I bought probably an extra million shares) are all going to tender,2022-01-12T17:19:50Z
$PQEFF I tendered 100K shares today @ Fidelity.  Now If the tender offer does not go through, I‚Äôm not sure what happens to my shares.  Do I receive the money for my shares at the price they were when I tendered or do I receive my shares back at whatever price they are when I receive them back.  The broker quoted me the price of the shares at the time I tendered.  I think this is important to know.  I still have another 100K shares in a different account that I did not tender yet.,2022-01-12T16:43:23Z
$PQEFF love that Canadian dollar. Conversion would be .592 USD right now.,2022-01-12T16:28:13Z

$PQEFF We hit a high of $.44 It‚Äôs likely going to go there today,2022-01-12T15:58:26Z
$PQEFF  6.2 million traded,2022-01-12T15:57:57Z
$PQEFF I have all of my shares tendered as of a week ago. However, I just took some profits off another stock. Do you think I should buy at .40 and hold through Feb 7 without tendering? Should I buy and Tender?,2022-01-12T15:56:07Z
$PQEFF Sorry about that last post it would not let me delete it,2022-01-12T15:45:51Z
$PQEFF someone buying up shares,this is not by chance,deal must be close to complete ,can&#39;t go wrong here,I am buying more now myself, can&#39;t lose,2022-01-12T15:43:55Z
$PQEFF I plan to tender in the next week or so but only 450k shares, retaining around 150k to see what happens. If Viston get the 50% +1 sought, it may turn out like Dragon Oil; 
 
&quot;The Emirates National Oil Company bought 54% of Dragon Oil in 1999 and the hq moved to Dubai that same year. 
 
In 2012 Dragon Oil launched a $200 million share buyback and the shares in Dubai rose 7 %.[15] In 2013 Forbes ranked Dragon Oil on Forbes Global 2000 at place 1902. 
 
From 2012 to 2015, Dragon Oil suffered setbacks caused by several delivery delays of a drilling platform, an important part of the companies progress in the Caspian Sea. 
 
ENOC had attempted to buy the remaining 46% since 2009, at 455p a share, and offered 650p in March 2015. The final price was 800p a share, in June 2015 after extensive back and forth with different minority shareholders.&quot; 
 
So, offer price for remaining shares went from 455p to 650p before eventually paying 800p. Here&#39;s hoping for something similar here.,2022-01-12T15:43:08Z
$PQEFF regarding these phone calls from this done what do you guys make of that? I haven‚Äôt received one yet,2022-01-12T15:41:06Z
