$FGI Rocket ship time.,2022-06-07T17:51:26Z
$HUSA Profits to $VTNR. Or go wild and throw some at $FGI.,2022-06-07T14:51:10Z
$VTNR Big THANK YOU to Icemanrush who introduced me to VTNR not too long ago. I have 34,423 shares and am enjoying the show. Yes, one can bemoan not having &quot;risked&quot; $1,000 at 50Â¢, or one can observe the opportunity that presents itself NOW, and go in heavy. Similar profit, on a more tested road. I am also heavy on $FGI. Anybody who thinks that company is fairly valued is a nutcase.,2022-06-07T14:35:11Z
$FGI Did I ladder it back up from $2.22 to $2.27? Maybe. I was hoping for $2.30, but it was a bad day. The market is realizing the value, though, and we are holding a nice upwards channel. Just waiting on word from management re: the interim guidance. I think this is going to be quite nice.,2022-06-03T20:15:50Z
$VTNR Big on this and $FGI. FGI is selling for a fraction of its fair value. Expecting great things from both!,2022-06-03T17:53:54Z
$FGI Pretty obvious by now looking at the chart over the last six weeks that the company has NO plans to help the stock. Incapable ATM. So we are going to have to rely on some partnerships moving forward and a strong upcoming ER to maybe drive the price. At least they sell products that people buy consistently.,2022-06-03T16:10:08Z
$FGI RH reported weak guidance,2022-06-03T12:16:25Z
$FGI Premarket pretend sales are humorous. Iâ€™d buy the dip but there are no shares to be had, in reality, at this price.,2022-06-03T11:21:28Z
$FGI Come on 2.40!!!!,2022-06-02T15:09:52Z
$FGI Only FGI could be sitting in the water with a bid of $2.27, an ask of $2.30, and yet a last price of $2.23. Definitely a stock to snag cheap when it &quot;glitches&quot; low, and hold for the bigger trend.,2022-06-02T14:12:31Z
$FGI I now own 6.8% of the public float.,2022-06-01T17:21:14Z

$FGI Nice, sustained recovery. HODL.,2022-06-01T14:58:47Z
$FGI Saw an FGI toilet at Lowes yesterday. I broke into tongues and worshiped it like a holy idol. Is that wrong? Asking for a friend.,2022-06-01T11:03:02Z

$FGI If Strange Things happen and this dips to $2.06, I am set to suck up 25k more shares. Tides are turning on FGI, and some bonus bucks on the way back up can be nice.,2022-05-31T16:05:15Z
