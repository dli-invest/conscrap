$FGI Did I ladder it back up from $2.22 to $2.27? Maybe. I was hoping for $2.30, but it was a bad day. The market is realizing the value, though, and we are holding a nice upwards channel. Just waiting on word from management re: the interim guidance. I think this is going to be quite nice.,2022-06-03T20:15:50Z
$VTNR Big on this and $FGI. FGI is selling for a fraction of its fair value. Expecting great things from both!,2022-06-03T17:53:54Z
$FGI Pretty obvious by now looking at the chart over the last six weeks that the company has NO plans to help the stock. Incapable ATM. So we are going to have to rely on some partnerships moving forward and a strong upcoming ER to maybe drive the price. At least they sell products that people buy consistently.,2022-06-03T16:10:08Z

$FGI Only FGI could be sitting in the water with a bid of $2.27, an ask of $2.30, and yet a last price of $2.23. Definitely a stock to snag cheap when it &quot;glitches&quot; low, and hold for the bigger trend.,2022-06-02T14:12:31Z
