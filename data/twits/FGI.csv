$FGI Somebody clearly wants a seat at the table. Reinforcement, I think, that we have found a bottom ands it is behind us. If we just sit on this stock while the market goes to crap, we should be flush with cash soon.,2022-06-13T19:54:13Z

$FGI 2.40 to red just like that. We&#39;ll see how low it goes today. Just an amazing last two months of ineptitude by Management. They wanted to get into the stock game. Trial by fire.,2022-06-13T14:55:01Z
$FGI All trades here big sells today.,2022-06-13T14:11:18Z
$DQ i mean imagine finding this at low 30s and putting it on your watchlist right before taking a short holiday from all the mayhem. Well at least this showed some stuff can still go up in this market. If anyone has any other plays like this waiting to boom please do share. I have started waiting in for $FGI to kick in. Have a look for yourselves gents.,2022-06-12T07:58:36Z
$FGI Just another day on the farm. Oink Oink. My next question to IR next week is to ask what they did with the 17 mil they made from the IPO in January, selling shares at $6 +.,2022-06-10T20:13:37Z

$FGI This tiny float thing is funny. I know that we all feel bad when the price moves down (I certainly do, as my holding is sizable). But keep in mind that it is a micro float. If you feel bad about the price, just change it. I do that when I feel not great about the broader picture. You just offer shares a little over the offer in little bits up the line and bring the price back up. I ALMOST got it back to $2.32 today. 
 
The other thing I do is work FGI into online posts whenever I can. I also made a Reddit board just for FGI where I publish the earnings call transcripts so that anybody (including all of us) can quote from them when pushing the stock. 
 
I know we wish the company would provide gimmicks to promote itself better. When they have real news, I absolutely am sure they will share it. Last earnings call intimated a major upcoming announcement.,2022-06-09T21:21:00Z
$FGI You know the company doesn&#39;t feel the need to help the stock on days like today.,2022-06-09T19:39:34Z

$HUSA Profits to $VTNR. Or go wild and throw some at $FGI.,2022-06-07T14:51:10Z
$VTNR Big THANK YOU to Icemanrush who introduced me to VTNR not too long ago. I have 34,423 shares and am enjoying the show. Yes, one can bemoan not having &quot;risked&quot; $1,000 at 50Â¢, or one can observe the opportunity that presents itself NOW, and go in heavy. Similar profit, on a more tested road. I am also heavy on $FGI. Anybody who thinks that company is fairly valued is a nutcase.,2022-06-07T14:35:11Z
$FGI Did I ladder it back up from $2.22 to $2.27? Maybe. I was hoping for $2.30, but it was a bad day. The market is realizing the value, though, and we are holding a nice upwards channel. Just waiting on word from management re: the interim guidance. I think this is going to be quite nice.,2022-06-03T20:15:50Z
$VTNR Big on this and $FGI. FGI is selling for a fraction of its fair value. Expecting great things from both!,2022-06-03T17:53:54Z
$FGI Pretty obvious by now looking at the chart over the last six weeks that the company has NO plans to help the stock. Incapable ATM. So we are going to have to rely on some partnerships moving forward and a strong upcoming ER to maybe drive the price. At least they sell products that people buy consistently.,2022-06-03T16:10:08Z
$FGI RH reported weak guidance,2022-06-03T12:16:25Z
$FGI Premarket pretend sales are humorous. Iâ€™d buy the dip but there are no shares to be had, in reality, at this price.,2022-06-03T11:21:28Z
$FGI Come on 2.40!!!!,2022-06-02T15:09:52Z
$FGI Only FGI could be sitting in the water with a bid of $2.27, an ask of $2.30, and yet a last price of $2.23. Definitely a stock to snag cheap when it &quot;glitches&quot; low, and hold for the bigger trend.,2022-06-02T14:12:31Z
$FGI I now own 6.8% of the public float.,2022-06-01T17:21:14Z
