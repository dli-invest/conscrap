$VTNR Buying this and $FGI like crazy. Every silly dip I can.,2022-05-19T20:10:27Z
$FGI Look at that price at the bell. Somebody offering $2 and it ends at $2.09. Somebody was trying to buy their own shares low, dollars to donuts. No idea why, but fascinating. I agree with Dan_Dorfman...this stock is worth much more and is a no-brainer buy at these levels.,2022-05-19T20:03:36Z
$FGI Wake up people..  
In a decent market this is a $5 stock...  I will wait from here..

$FGI  $HD CEO said home improvement for existing homes &quot;has never been stronger&quot;.    
Never is a long time... This will find traction in time..,2022-05-17T14:06:41Z
$HD $FGI Congrats HD on some great earnings. Ever heard of Glacier Bay, HD&#39;s in-house store brand for bath products? The company behind that is FGI...an underpriced up-and-comer. Just had its guidance confirmed, consistently profitable, and with multiple incoming catalysts hinted at in the recent earnings call. FGI also does in-house bath brand for Lowes and is in Menard&#39;s, etc. Under the radar...prime time to buy.,2022-05-17T13:54:24Z
$FGI Stoked about FGI&#39;s setup...multiple positive catalysts incoming, guidance reaffirmed, great HD numbers. Anybody who missed the earnings call can visit https://www.reddit.com/r/fgi_industries/ for the transcript as well as a look at these &quot;catalysts&quot; I mentioned. They were vague but extremely deliberate in putting this out there. Management is EXCITED.,2022-05-17T13:42:55Z
$FGI  HD numbers great and Lowes on deck tomorrow.. FGI will rebound back to a break above $2.60 soon.

$FGI IF &amp; When this war is done or Putin is taken out of power. Which is getting close IMO. I think the stock market will go up big.,2022-05-16T23:17:25Z
$MDV $FGI $NXGL $BTAI all 3 oilers I’m in are up big - these 4 I’m down and will most likely cut the dead weight soon… the first 2, I don’t see what will drive them up since ER came and nothing changed. The last two I’m willing to give it a chance - mid june is my deadline and BTAI goes when XBI does.,2022-05-16T22:41:56Z
$FGI FGI holders know to sit and do nothing as long as the price is so indefensibly low. Thus, the volume. Check th Reddit for the transcript call-outs that show some very nice catalysts shaping up. It is all very auspicious in my opinion and when that hits the street, we will get volume and price spiking.,2022-05-16T17:57:14Z
$FGI geez I did some dd. Put a bid in over weekend. Gtc. Voluntary. Is 10 shares in 30 min. How is anyone supposed to get in or out..,2022-05-16T13:59:22Z
$FGI New investors willing to take a little loss after getting in since this thing always has zero volume. And hopefully Management sees that these investors’ conferences are a complete waste of time.,2022-05-16T13:47:13Z
