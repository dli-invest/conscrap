$FGI It&#39;s going up soon 
Hold on,2022-05-16T23:26:58Z
$FGI IF &amp; When this war is done or Putin is taken out of power. Which is getting close IMO. I think the stock market will go up big.,2022-05-16T23:17:25Z
$MDV $FGI $NXGL $BTAI all 3 oilers I‚Äôm in are up big - these 4 I‚Äôm down and will most likely cut the dead weight soon‚Ä¶ the first 2, I don‚Äôt see what will drive them up since ER came and nothing changed. The last two I‚Äôm willing to give it a chance - mid june is my deadline and BTAI goes when XBI does.,2022-05-16T22:41:56Z
$FGI FGI holders know to sit and do nothing as long as the price is so indefensibly low. Thus, the volume. Check th Reddit for the transcript call-outs that show some very nice catalysts shaping up. It is all very auspicious in my opinion and when that hits the street, we will get volume and price spiking.,2022-05-16T17:57:14Z
$FGI geez I did some dd. Put a bid in over weekend. Gtc. Voluntary. Is 10 shares in 30 min. How is anyone supposed to get in or out..,2022-05-16T13:59:22Z
$FGI New investors willing to take a little loss after getting in since this thing always has zero volume. And hopefully Management sees that these investors‚Äô conferences are a complete waste of time.,2022-05-16T13:47:13Z

$FGI Earnings call for beat-up microfloat $FGI hinted at SEVERAL SURPRISE CATALYSTS headed our way this quarter... Nobody caught this stuff. This Reddit story puts it on the table. https://www.reddit.com/r/fgi_industries/comments/uozo05/fgi_teases_quite_large_mystery_catalysts_in_q1/ 
 
$HD $LOW,2022-05-13T19:54:13Z
$FGI Added 2.05 all time lows for a swing. I wanted more exposure in case the market is bullish next week. If the market continues higher, this seems like an absolute steal down here. $182mil revenue &amp; $8mil profit on a $19mil market cap has to be the most ‚Äúundervalued‚Äù numbers I‚Äôve ever seen on a nano-cap,2022-05-13T19:20:37Z
$FGI Buddha&#39;s ancestors 
Please help me Help me, please.,2022-05-13T19:14:14Z
$FGI So where are all these shares at 2.05 coming from? No ATM, insiders not selling, big holders on here not selling...naked shorts? Who knows?,2022-05-13T18:25:40Z
$FGI 
Guys‚Ä¶üëÄ
This should move very soon on the direction 
Typical falling wedge pattern 
Hopefully bullish move 
IMO it‚Äôs a bargain here but needs to hold $1.80 otherwise likely to fall 
Upside potential $2.50, $3, $3.50+
GL everyone,2022-05-13T17:24:18Z
$FGI 
Added some here 
Micro float Only 2.5 mil shares available 
IMO support at $1.85
Adding more if we dip there
Below that might dump 
This needs bigger volume to move
No worries no rush
GL everyone,2022-05-13T17:18:03Z
$FGI no buyers‚Ä¶ too bad. Got me more 2.10 today. 
$SOFI locked in 5.20 to 6.7 for a 1 day swing trade. ‚úåüèº,2022-05-13T17:17:33Z
$FGI Talked with investors desk this morning and there is not an ATM going on right now and no plans for one in the near future.,2022-05-13T16:33:01Z
$FGI primed for a pop,2022-05-13T15:13:20Z
$FGI Funny how NSDQ is just feeding shares super low all day and then BANG, they put them up at 2.44 AH. This ticker is starting to have a little stink to it.,2022-05-12T20:02:10Z
$FGI is there dilution here? the algos tend to always walk it back down no matter what.,2022-05-12T19:43:03Z
$FGI Am I the only one that noted they hinted STRONGLY that a major client is being on-boarded...a client that would distract senior management from its aquisition task, sliding that into next year? A client that gives them the confidence to easily affirm their guidance for the year in spite of challenges? Those guys have an Ace up the sleeve...I have no doubt about it. And it sounds like they will be announcing it before next earnings. AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO HEARD THIS?!? I am going to snag the various quotes that substantiate this as soon as I have a little time with the transcript. But once I do that, you guys need to share the news far and wide. It&#39;s big.,2022-05-12T18:59:33Z
$FGI got another 9,010 at $2.09 at open. Holding over 49,000 shares now,2022-05-12T15:50:52Z
