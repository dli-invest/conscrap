$HD $FGI Congrats HD on some great earnings. Ever heard of Glacier Bay, HD&#39;s in-house store brand for bath products? The company behind that is FGI...an underpriced up-and-comer. Just had its guidance confirmed, consistently profitable, and with multiple incoming catalysts hinted at in the recent earnings call. FGI also does in-house bath brand for Lowes and is in Menard&#39;s, etc. Under the radar...prime time to buy.,2022-05-17T13:54:24Z
$FGI Stoked about FGI&#39;s setup...multiple positive catalysts incoming, guidance reaffirmed, great HD numbers. Anybody who missed the earnings call can visit https://www.reddit.com/r/fgi_industries/ for the transcript as well as a look at these &quot;catalysts&quot; I mentioned. They were vague but extremely deliberate in putting this out there. Management is EXCITED.,2022-05-17T13:42:55Z
$FGI  HD numbers great and Lowes on deck tomorrow.. FGI will rebound back to a break above $2.60 soon.

$FGI FGI holders know to sit and do nothing as long as the price is so indefensibly low. Thus, the volume. Check th Reddit for the transcript call-outs that show some very nice catalysts shaping up. It is all very auspicious in my opinion and when that hits the street, we will get volume and price spiking.,2022-05-16T17:57:14Z

$FGI Added 2.05 all time lows for a swing. I wanted more exposure in case the market is bullish next week. If the market continues higher, this seems like an absolute steal down here. $182mil revenue &amp; $8mil profit on a $19mil market cap has to be the most ‚Äúundervalued‚Äù numbers I‚Äôve ever seen on a nano-cap,2022-05-13T19:20:37Z
