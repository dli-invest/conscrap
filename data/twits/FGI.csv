Largest overnight position is $HOUR because of the 21% short interest followed by $SVRE and then $FGI / $ISPC . Largest Iâ€™ve gone overnight in a while because it seems like we could have a clear IPO theme next week,2022-07-29T19:55:35Z
Well I think weâ€™ve exhausted every possible option of low float IPOs from this week.

Going forward into next week, I think older IPOs will begin to get hit if we continue with this theme. My favorites (Iâ€™ll be swinging) are $HOUR $SVRE $FGI &amp; $ISPC . Maybe we get some more IPO runners Monday! Kind of a no brainer for me considering the IPOs I mentioned above are relatively stable. So risk a couple % for potential +100% reward? Yes please.,2022-07-29T19:23:08Z
$HOUR Perking on volume. I took 5k just in case. 22% short interest. And I really hope this runs because it should ignite $FGI too. IPOs are HOT,2022-07-29T15:42:32Z
Had a pretty great day yesterday +$8,500 and up $1k already today so Iâ€™m just being patient. Low float IPOs &amp; despacs are the hottest theme weâ€™ve seen in a while. My favorite low float IPOs are $ISPC $SVRE &amp; $FGI .

FGI has excellent financials and ISPC has a long runway of cash, so theyâ€™re relatively low risk and I see favorable risk:reward from these levels. With how small &amp; explosive the float/structures are, Iâ€™m just accumulating any dips and weâ€™ll see if any of them catch on,2022-07-29T14:15:26Z
Swinging $FGI and $SVRE as lower risk potential $SKYX and $HKD sympathies respectively. Seems like recent IPOs/low floats are the best place to be right now,2022-07-28T19:47:48Z
$FGI Could be interesting as a low float recent IPO sympathy to $SKYX . Ceiling fans/light fixtures some of the same thing FGI sells. Not to mention FGI is inanely undervalued as it is,2022-07-28T17:33:44Z
$FGI I do not have any shares in range to sell today. So I cannot move the price for you. One of you, with some shares, needs to sell them if you want to lift &#39;er up. If offered, they get bought. But if you all just hold tight, we see these silly moves on dinky volume.,2022-07-28T16:31:42Z

$FGI some idiot was selling 80,000 shares at $2.60 today. Totally stopped the potential of a rally. If you it was you, learn how to trade.,2022-07-22T19:52:34Z
$FGI &quot;After last week&#39;s 17% share price gain to US$2.52, the stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of 6x. Average forward P/E is 11x in the Trade Distributors industry in the US.&quot; (Simply Wall Street Alert) 
 
Translation: Room to nearly double, conservatively.,2022-07-21T22:37:39Z
$FGI I sold shares I got cheap on the dip to add some fuel to the fire here and get the price up in a better direction. 36k shares, or so. Not touching core position...these are just shares I bought to keep things lively on slow days. I think the market is warming to small cap and either we hop up a level or fall back...and if we fall back, I will suck &#39;em back up... This is a STRANGE stock where selling helps raise the price. When selling a few hundred, meh, but once I put bigger lots up, they had appeal and would get bought quickly.,2022-07-21T19:32:23Z
$FGI by any standards is worth $6-$8 per share. I think not buying more now is a big mistake.,2022-07-21T19:01:36Z
$FGI IPO in January at above six and we are here now? Where is David Bruce in July??? Why is he not buying back shares down here that he sold for 6.25 in January?,2022-07-14T16:46:03Z

$FGI 154,376 shares and holding. Fun to buy up the silly dips and sell them back to ladder up the price. It&#39;s better than torturing small rabbits, I guess.,2022-07-08T20:19:12Z
