$FGI Look at that price at the bell. Somebody offering $2 and it ends at $2.09. Somebody was trying to buy their own shares low, dollars to donuts. No idea why, but fascinating. I agree with Dan_Dorfman...this stock is worth much more and is a no-brainer buy at these levels.,2022-05-19T20:03:36Z
$FGI Wake up people..  
In a decent market this is a $5 stock...  I will wait from here..

$HD $FGI Congrats HD on some great earnings. Ever heard of Glacier Bay, HD&#39;s in-house store brand for bath products? The company behind that is FGI...an underpriced up-and-comer. Just had its guidance confirmed, consistently profitable, and with multiple incoming catalysts hinted at in the recent earnings call. FGI also does in-house bath brand for Lowes and is in Menard&#39;s, etc. Under the radar...prime time to buy.,2022-05-17T13:54:24Z
$FGI Stoked about FGI&#39;s setup...multiple positive catalysts incoming, guidance reaffirmed, great HD numbers. Anybody who missed the earnings call can visit https://www.reddit.com/r/fgi_industries/ for the transcript as well as a look at these &quot;catalysts&quot; I mentioned. They were vague but extremely deliberate in putting this out there. Management is EXCITED.,2022-05-17T13:42:55Z
