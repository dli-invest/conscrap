$FGI This tiny float thing is funny. I know that we all feel bad when the price moves down (I certainly do, as my holding is sizable). But keep in mind that it is a micro float. If you feel bad about the price, just change it. I do that when I feel not great about the broader picture. You just offer shares a little over the offer in little bits up the line and bring the price back up. I ALMOST got it back to $2.32 today. 
 
The other thing I do is work FGI into online posts whenever I can. I also made a Reddit board just for FGI where I publish the earnings call transcripts so that anybody (including all of us) can quote from them when pushing the stock. 
 
I know we wish the company would provide gimmicks to promote itself better. When they have real news, I absolutely am sure they will share it. Last earnings call intimated a major upcoming announcement.,2022-06-09T21:21:00Z
$FGI You know the company doesn&#39;t feel the need to help the stock on days like today.,2022-06-09T19:39:34Z

$HUSA Profits to $VTNR. Or go wild and throw some at $FGI.,2022-06-07T14:51:10Z
$VTNR Big THANK YOU to Icemanrush who introduced me to VTNR not too long ago. I have 34,423 shares and am enjoying the show. Yes, one can bemoan not having &quot;risked&quot; $1,000 at 50Â¢, or one can observe the opportunity that presents itself NOW, and go in heavy. Similar profit, on a more tested road. I am also heavy on $FGI. Anybody who thinks that company is fairly valued is a nutcase.,2022-06-07T14:35:11Z
$FGI Did I ladder it back up from $2.22 to $2.27? Maybe. I was hoping for $2.30, but it was a bad day. The market is realizing the value, though, and we are holding a nice upwards channel. Just waiting on word from management re: the interim guidance. I think this is going to be quite nice.,2022-06-03T20:15:50Z
$VTNR Big on this and $FGI. FGI is selling for a fraction of its fair value. Expecting great things from both!,2022-06-03T17:53:54Z
$FGI Pretty obvious by now looking at the chart over the last six weeks that the company has NO plans to help the stock. Incapable ATM. So we are going to have to rely on some partnerships moving forward and a strong upcoming ER to maybe drive the price. At least they sell products that people buy consistently.,2022-06-03T16:10:08Z

$FGI Premarket pretend sales are humorous. Iâ€™d buy the dip but there are no shares to be had, in reality, at this price.,2022-06-03T11:21:28Z
$FGI Come on 2.40!!!!,2022-06-02T15:09:52Z
$FGI Only FGI could be sitting in the water with a bid of $2.27, an ask of $2.30, and yet a last price of $2.23. Definitely a stock to snag cheap when it &quot;glitches&quot; low, and hold for the bigger trend.,2022-06-02T14:12:31Z
