7 days ago,Hey SBLK followersFound this on the Stifel Website ....  posted Feb 17thTough to beat a strong quarter, much better than expected dividend, and fantastic rate guidance for 1Q. Generally, the dry bulk market is still very firm and the forward curve throughout the year is elevated, although unquestionably the dry bulk demand is heavily correlated to global industrial production, but supply is low and there is certainly a strong possibility of a protracted strong market. Based on our spot rate assumptions, we expect SBLK to pay out more than $5/ share in dividends this year, which translates into a very impressive yield even with the recent rise in share price. Consequently, we still expect further upside.They have a buy rating     Target price $35Does anyone know what other analysts are predicting???What are other analyst saying????More,SteveGbongo,,13,1

9 days ago,Deutsche Bank - SBLK model update- SBLK reported 4Q EBITDA of $355M, beating consensus expectations of $315M, as well as declaring a $2.00 dividend per share in 4Q. The company booked a daily TCE of $37.4k for the quarter and booked 80% of its days at $26.1k, above consensus expectations. Overall, it was a solid quarter and we expect the company to declare a dividend in 1Q well over $1.00 per share. Assuming a 1Q daily TCE of $26.1k and a $11k breakeven on 128 vessels, the company will generate  $165M  in  surplus  cashflow  in  1Q,  which  translates  to  roughly  $1.60 dividend per share, assuming 102M shares.  We have updated our model and project 2022 EBITDA of $889M (consensus: $877M) and 2023 EBITDA of $798M (consensus: $784M). Maintain Buy./More,c,,9,1

14 days ago,Just now took a position at 29.07. Feeling good!,james,,7,1
14 days ago,First stab at the 1Q22 dividend:  My expectation is $1.25 - $1.75...with a base case of just under $1.50.In the 4Q earnings presentation, they highlighted a cash balance of $593.7mm at Feb 15th...up $120mm from December 31st.  If the cash balance grows by $80mm the rest of the quarter (67% of the rate in the first half of the quarter), the cash balance would end at $673.7mm.Then we need to back out three main numbers to get to the quarter end cash balance available for the dividends.  Subtract $204.5mm for the dividend paid on March 15th, $50mm for debt amortization, and $268.8mm of cash for the retained cash policy ($2.1mm per 128 ships).  So if you start with the $573.7mm, back out the dividend of $204.5mm, the retained cash of $268.8mm, and $50mm of debt, it leaves you with $150.4mm of cash for a dividend.   Divided by 103mm shares gets you $1.45 per share.  That would be an incredible accomplishment for the seasonally low 1Q and is, I think, a reasonable scenario.More,jmc,,17,2

17 days ago,The path to $70/share - Deutsche Bank Research, Amit MehrotraOur bullish thesis on SBLK shares over the past few years is continuing to gain traction, with shares last week reaching over $30 / $3 billion in market cap and average daily trading volume since mid-2021 of about $45 million. This level of activity is more than 4x average daily trading volume since mid-2020. Very simply, SBLK is now becoming investible for the first time by large institutional investors, which warrants an update to our long-held bullish stance on the company and the outlook for equity value per share. We have long been supporters of SBLK, since we upgraded the stock to Buy in late 2016. The underlying premise was management’s strong corporate governance, fortress-like balance sheet and resulting low break evens, and transparent, high quality and very shareholder friendly cash deployment/dividend strategy. As we’ve said before, based on our assessment of SBLK’s capital structure and break-even points, we believe the company will be able to pay a sustainable dividend of $4 per share under mid-cycle rate assumptions. And this is after debt repayments, meaning SBLK is de-leveraging via regular debt amortization before returning cash to shareholders. The beauty of this strategy is it actually increases SBLK’s operating leverage to rising rates while limiting cash burn in weak markets – achieving both dynamics via lower break evens and lower cash calls associated with debt service and repayment. While other shipping companies in some instances also have fortress-like balance sheets, few are at the scale of SBLK that attracts accretive M&amp;A opportunities. We note, for example, that almost half SBLK’s asset base (58 ships since the start of 2019) were acquired via accretive ship-for-share deals, where sellers were willing to accept SBLK shares struck a premium to public market prices in exchange for access to liquidity and even potential upside over time (as has been the case since those deals were closed). This is a value proposition that should allow for further benefits to SBLK shareholders. Beyond just M&amp;A opportunities, we continue to see opportunity for SBLK shares to de-couple from net asset value parameters and more towards a dividend yield. We are confident in this evolution given our understanding of SBLK’s cash calls and long-run spot rates. For example, our $40 price target is based on 10% yield applied our $4 per share sustainable dividend forecast. But as we discussed in a recent note (here), 99% of companies on the NYSE and NASDAQ trade at yields better (i.e ower) than 10%. If we take the midpoint of 10% and the S&amp;P 500 div. yield of 1.3%, it would imply equity value per share of just over $70. This is the opportunity, in our view, and while it won’t happen overnight, and there is sure to be volatility along the way.... we think factors within the company’s control, namely capital structure and capital deployment, limit downside and can allow a much higher valuation level to be achieved over time. Maintain Buy.More,c,,15,2

21 days ago,Russia, China May Drive Dry-Bulk Rates Higher From Seasonal LowsLee A Klaskow, the primary analyst for this report.BI Senior Industry AnalystDrybulk rates are poised to move higher, we believe, from disruptions created by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, China resuming production activity, the rational order book and seasonal trends. Supply-demand dynamics should support profitable dry-bulk rates, which are off to a good start this year. (02/24/22)1. Conflict Will Push Dry-Bulk Rates HigherRussia's invasion of Ukraine will likely complicate coal and agriculture trades, pushing dry-bulk rates higher as capacity is absorbed from importers looking for longer tonne-mile alternatives. The two countries account for about 25% of wheat and 20% of corn exports in addition to being the largest sunflower oil exporters. Russia accounted for about 17% of seaborne coal trade, according to IEA. The Baltic Dry Index is up 13% on average this year despite coming down 60% from October highs. This should provide a positive backdrop and support profitable rates in 2022.The BDI is a traditional barometer of the health of the industry since it tracks the cost of moving dry-bulk freight via 23 seaborne routes and gauges supply and demand. MOL, NYK, Hyundai Merchant and Star Bulk are leading carriers by revenue and capacity. (02/24/22)2. Dry-Bulk Rates Poised to Rise From Seasonal LowsDry-bulk rates could move higher as seasonal weakness concludes, with China's factories resuming production following the Lunar New Year and as controls put in place to improve air quality during the Winter Olympics come to an end. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine will likely add to rate volatility. Capesize rates are up 35% from a year ago even as they've fallen 26% on average so far in 2022 given the lows in January. Rates for smaller ships have fared better this year, with Supramax rising 62% on average, followed by a 60% gain for Handysize. Dry-bulk demand growth may outpace supply increases by 40 bps, according to Clarksons. This should help support rates well above breakeven levels.NYK, Pan Ocean, China Cosco, Diana Shipping and Golden Ocean are among the largest owners of Capesize ships. (02/24/22)More,c,,19,1

SBLK is in a great position to capitalize on this trend and shares will be much higher by years end.Good luck longs!,TJ,,6,1
28 days ago,Russia-Ukraine war to crash dry bulk cratesin Dry Bulk Market,International Shipping News 14/02/2022The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has the potential to turn into a full-fledged war and, if that happens, it will send the dry bulk freight rates crashing down.Over the past few years, Russia and Ukraine have become major exporters of dry bulk commodities, with Russia mainly exporting coal, grain, steel products and fertilisers, while Ukraine exports grain, iron ore and steel products. The ongoing tension between the two countries could turn into a full-scale war, which has the potential of hampering exports of these commodities.Additionally, more than 700 dry bulk vessels are loaded at Russian and Ukrainian ports every month, and if the war disrupts shipments even for a month, these vessels might look for alternate cargoes elsewhere, increasing effective supply by more than 4%. Hence, the dry bulk market will face a double whammy – a sharp decline in trade and a surge in supply that has the potential to bring rates down to historical levels.The majority of Europe has shunned nuclear power over the years and has shifted to gas-fired power generation for domestic electricity demand. Russia supplies one-third of the EU’s gas requirements and a substantial part of the gas comes through the pipeline passing via Ukraine. In case of a war, the gas supply will also get affected, increasing gas prices that will put pressure on coal as the EU will be forced to switch to coal-fired power generation. Additionally, the EU has already said that the Nordstream 2 pipeline will not get approval if Russia invades Ukraine.Meanwhile, Russia supplied 42% of the EU’s total coal imports in 2021 and 16% of the global coal requirements. If the impending war halts Russia’s coal exports, the global supply will be insufficient to counterbalance Russia’s share. Consequently, coal prices will soar, limiting the demand from many Asian countries, further affecting coal trade and shipping demand.China has recently increased its coal (coking and non-coking) imports from Russia amid the former’s trade tension with Australia. In case Russia is unable to supply coal to China, the latter might be forced to buy Australian coal, further increasing tonne miles.Furthermore, Ukraine exports around 40% of its grain to the Middle East and North Africa. These countries are heavily dependent on the Black Sea’s corn and wheat supply. If the crisis worsens, the Handysize, Supramax and Panamax markets will be severely impacted.Lastly, Ukraine exported 36.5 million tonnes of iron ore in 2021, of which more than 60% was destined to China. As Brazil continues to struggle to operate at its full capacity, the deficit created by Ukraine will have to be met by increasing exports from Australia. Even if Australia increases its exports to meet the additional demand, there will be a substantial impact on the average haulage length. However, we believe that Australia would be unable to make up for Ukraine’s share, which would decelerate global iron ore trade.Hence, a war between Russia and Ukraine will deter vessels to sail to Russian and Ukrainian ports. As a result, demand for dry bulk vessels will be hit, rendering many dry bulk vessels unemployed.Source: DrewryMore,Gary,,3,9

Since that's only 3 weeks ago, it's making it very difficult for those looking for an entry point to purchase at this level.  We put in a long base, 7 months, before breaking out of the channel to the upside.  Although we've had a recent strong run, it may have more legs because of the long base.  While it's tough to chase, it's even more difficult to catch the bottom.  If you're positive on the bulkers and you think that there's a decent chance that we may be entering a super cycle, buying at $26-$27 as opposed to $23-$24 is no big deal.  SBLK isn't the only bulker performing strongly and reaching new highs, so that lends some support to good times ahead.Given the macro's, I think we've got several good years ahead of us.

last month,$SBLK $GOGL $EGLE $SHIPAs we sail to new highs, I'm sure some of you are considering taking profit. However, the situation is still incredibly bullish, and here's why we can look forward to a great rest of the year.First, Q1 is generally where the stock tanks due to the BDI collapsing. The opposite is happening right now, signaling that sentiment and conditions are turning favorable. Q2+Q3+Q4 are usually all excellent so really we are in for a bull run with little significant pullback for the rest of the year.Secondly, we have multiple catalysts lined up.1. Olympics ending = China's Blue Sky policy ending which means steel mills reopen and start production again.2. Summer is ending soon for the southern hemisphere (Brazil, Argentina, etc.) which means rainfall will slow down which means more exports.3. The BDI is recovering sooner than expected. This means that Q1 will be better than expected which is obviously bullish for both dividends and earnings per share.4. Q4 earnings report next week which is going to be record breaking and should send us up significantly.5. I am hesitant to use this word because it's commonly associated with memes, but yes, I do believe the possibility of a squeeze is possible. Not a short squeeze, but a supply/demand squeeze where there is too much global demand for vessels to meet it.Combining all of these factors, I believe we are entering the initial stages of a multi-year super cycle. Dry bulk stocks could double from today's prices and still be undervalued. I do not know what tomorrow will bring, or what next week will bring, but I do know that the sector is entering both a fundamental and structural bull cycle.Positions: Jan '23 $20 call (up 140%)Jan '24 $25 call (up 55%)More,Magic,,0,0

last month,Does anyone have any information on what percentage of the fleet is fixed for Q1 and at what average TCE?  The last info that I heard was at the Q3 conference call on November 17th.  At that time management stated that 17% of the fleet was fixed for Q1 at slightly less than $32,000, a great number.  Management expressed at that time that rates had fallen but that they were expecting a bounce and that they were seeking to fix more if possible.  They got the bounce but I don't know if they placed the fix.  When the company attended the yearly maritine conference two weeks ago I listened in hopes of getting that information.  As luck would have it the last question asked pertained to forward fixing but management didn't have an opportunity to respond because they had a hard 45 minute rule and they ran out of time before they could respond.  We'll find out on the 17th during the Q 4 conference call but any guess on Q1 is just that, a guess w/o more info.

last month,What yield to value Dry Bulk? Amit Mehrotra, Deutsche BankIn this week's Weekly Voyage, we assess an appropriate dividend yield to value dry bulk companies such as SBLK. By looking at the NYSE and NASDAQ, we find very few companies trading above a 10% dividend, only 65 out of 5648 names. For reference, zero names trade above a 10% dividend yield in the S&amp;P 500, with the highest being Lumen Technologies (LMN) at ~9%. We also highlight that out of the 65 NYSE names, nearly all have not sustained an above 10% dividend yield, with only ~8% maintaining it for over a year, of which almost all were non-operating companies (ie investment funds). In the broader context of the NYSE and NASDAQ. those stocks represent less than 1% of the total universes. Ultimately, our analysis suggests that a 10% dividend yield is a reasonable way to value a company that consistently sustains a dividend but operates in a highly cyclical industry and very high operating leverage. But ultimately we see potential for better valuation as the business model gains further acceptance and recognition.In  the  context  of  SBLK,  we  expect  the  company  can  maintain  a  $4  mid-cycle  dividend and at a 10% dividend yield, so the company should be worth $40, ~100% upside.Importantly, spot rates don’t need to be overly heroic for this type of cash flow to be generated, driven by SBLK’s very low break-even levels. While we acknowledge the company has had significant dividends in 2021, with $1.25 declared last quarter, and the stock has not reacted accordingly, the aforementioned analysis suggests that stock could move if investors become convinced by the sustainability of the payout model..More,c,,3,1

last month,Company gave extremely bullish forecast for the next 2-3 years.  CFO stopped just short of conceding they were going into a "super cycle" comparable to 10 yrs ago (go check a long=term chart if you're not sure what a supercycle looks like).  He noted that supercycle was driven by extreme economic demand while this cycle is driven by "capacity" aka shipping volumes.  The constrained capacity issue is driven by an extremely small number of orders for new ships because of the anticipated change in propulsion systems (due to green efforts to minimize greenhouse gases).  Short version;  shipping companies are ordering very few new ships for the next few years creating a capacity shortage and very high shipping prices.  He minimized the effect of any elevation in the cost of fuel in the interim as they just pass that along.  This bullish phase should be industry wide but on top of this SBLK has a track record of great management.Disclosure:  Long SBLK, NMM, GSL and GOGLMore,Michael,,0,0
last month,In reply to Michael.  They have a dividend policy which is a formula based primarily on the cash balance. They have not announced a dividend but they have given their cash balance in a presentation. Very likely the dividend will be very close to 2.00 for the 4th quarter. The Baltic index is an indicator of current shipping rates.  SBLK  charters their ships partially in the spot market and also has contracts  for short to mid term periods. This is off season. and generally a period of lower rates.  Most recently rates have improved.  The improvement likely is related to China buying iron ore.  Others on this board could forecast what the dividend would be for the current quarter at current rates.  My guess would be about .60.  February and  March could improve slightly and we could have a dividend of .75 partially because rates were previously contracted.  In my opinion China will be importing lots of iron ore and rates will return to previous levels. In my mind I am projecting dividends of   .   .75 first quarter 2022   .90  second quarter   1.30  third quarter and   1.60  for 4th quarter. If correct shareholders would receive 2.00 in March 2022 and 4.55 in the 12 months after that.  If anything I am probably high for  first and second quarter and low for the third and fourth.More,Burnell,,11,1

2 months ago,Attention dry bulk shipping investors: Are you concerned with your shares continuing to trade down amid the slumping dry bulk rates and Baltic Dry Index? Perhaps what you need is a superior, much more diversified shipping investment to go along with your holdings. May I point you to the following relatively lesser known (in the U.S.) very deep value Japanese diversified shippers:Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha (U.S. ticker: KAIKY)Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (U.S. ticker: NPNYY)Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (U.S. ticker: MSLOY)These are very established, century-old global shipping companies, each with large fleets diversified across dry bulk, tanker, containership, LNG carrier, LPG, and car carrier ships. In the case on NPNYY (the largest of the three), the diversification extends even further into air freight, land freight and real estate. Together, the three companies operate their containership fleets (currently by far the most profitable sector of their businesses) as ONE (literally). That's right, their fully owned (by the three of them) joint containership business is called Ocean Network Express (ONE) and is the world's 6th largest container carrier and has been raking in massive profits, to say the very least.If you are wondering about valuation, well, these three world-class shipping companies are absurdly undervalued. Each has a P/E of around 2. That's right: 2. Not only that, each has a forward annual dividend yield ranging from 8% to 14%. Half of the annual dividend for each is coming soon (ex-dividend date of March 30, 2022 for all three).With the recent swoon in the Baltic Dry Index, just like most of your favorite dry bulk shippers, you can pick up shares in these very high quality shipping companies at a big discount right now relative to last month. But guess what: these three shippers are still raking in massive  profits from their large container fleets unlike dry bulk pure plays that are struggling with today's low dry bulk rates. While I am bullish on the BDI going forward (I have recently initiated a long position in BDRY), as far as investing in the shippers themselves, I prefer these undervalued, diversified, high quality Japanese shipping companies.My largest position of the three is in KAIKY. KAIKY is the smallest of the three by market cap and, not coincidentally, enjoys proportionately  the largest exposure of the three to the lucrative containership part of their businesses. I have a smaller position in NPNYY and no current position in MSLOY (just because the overlapping nature of these three stocks arguably makes investing in all three unnecessary). If you are interested in investing in these, make sure you do the exchange rate and share ratio math first and understand that the trading of these tickers is very, very thin in the U.S. (this is proof of how little known and therefore undervalued these quality shippers are). Make sure you don't pay too much for your shares (try limit orders in the middle of the spread). But because of the thin trading, it is almost impossible to buy shares without paying a slight premium (1% to 3%) to the Tokyo shares of each company. Key ratios to know: 2 KAIKY shares = 1 Tokyo share of Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha; 5 NPNYY shares = 1 Tokyo share of Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha; 2 MSLOY shares = 1 Tokyo share of Mitsui O.S.K. Lines.Good luck to all shipping investors.$KAIKY $NPNYY $MSLOY $SBLK $EGLE $BDRY $SB $GOGL $GNK $DSX $NMMMore,jerry,,0,0

After announcing their new dividend policy in May, SBLK now has one of the best payout structures in shipping. The firm has paid out $0.3 and $0.7 per share in dividends for the first and second quarters of 2021. SBLK will most likely announce a dividend for the third quarter somewhere in the $1.15-$1.25 pershare range, depending on movement in net working capital.We believe the best way to look at this business is through cash generation potential and how much is returned to investors. The current equity valuation does not reflect current rates for shipping (earnings), partly because of the velocity of the move in rates and because shipping cycles turn, and it’s not clear whether this is a local top or the early innings of a multi-year cycle. Our belief is the latter. Part of our catalyst is the market re-rating the stock higher once the length of the increased earnings power becomes understood. It is a relatively strong catalyst in the sense that with a strong dividend policy, we can be patient for the market to underwrite this story as the cash is either returned to us via a high dividend yield if the market is either slow or chooses not to join our side of the trade.Our estimates suggest a time-charter equivalent rate (net profit or loss of operating a vessel daily) of at least $30,000 for SBLK in Q4, with the firm earning a potential annual average of $26,000. Our base case is that this is a strong floor going into next year, with little need to articulate much more upside. If rates hold, which we expect them to do, we could see a 20+% annual dividend year next year for SBLK. If the market priced the equity such that the dividend yield was 8%, that implies a $62 stock. Today our base case target for the firm is $37 per share. This is likely conservative as we know that third-quarter rates are higher than the second quarter, and third-quarter dividends will most likely reflect that. We are cautious about diving too deep into the sensitivities to the upside with this position as we are arriving at some pretty remunerative torque using current contracted values and seemingly conservative forecasts…”More,c,,0,0

3 months ago,On Dec 8th we closed at $23.46, today, Dec 14 th, we closed at $18.67, down $4.79 for that period of time.  Yes, we did accrue the $1.25 dividend within that time frame.  While it's true that all of the bulkers have suffered some price erosion during this period, it seems that SBLK has been struck harder than others.  This downturn caused me to reread all of the earnings call transcripts for the year.  Having done so I have concluded that management may have misled we longs so I am asking that all longs, including James, join me in a class action suit, holding management to account for acting erratically in the management of the company.  Specifically, management frequently alludes to shareholder enhancement actions and follows up by doing as they promised.  That kind of behaviour tends to confuse we investors in this sector because It isn't the norm.  Also, this team lays out goals and shares insights on how they intend accomplish them and clarifies how they will spend our money.  Speaking of spending our money, they have the audacity to insist that we owners receive a generous portion via dividends.  This action alone is cause for malfeasance and can easily be proven by citing remarks by a few Analysts that this action isn;t helping elevate the share price.  I would not be surprised at all if when Q4 is announced they insist that we accept an even larger dividend than received in Q3.  Also, why are they spending money buying back under valued shares, restructuring debt at lower rates of interest and retiring debt early?  Yes, I realize that some may think that these activities seem like shareholder enhancemant, but really?  Sorry fellow longs and James, just amusing myself.  As previously posted, looking forward to my $4 in dividends and $30 share price by the end of 2022/More,George,,6,1

3 months ago,Share price is taking a pause from a 33% move off the near-term bottom in the last 3 weeks.  This healthy pause was exacerbated (and super painful) by the selling typically seen after the ex-dividend date.  However, Friday's selling was on low volume, it was just half the average daily volume (favorable).  Also, although SBLK closed down for the day, the intra-day price action saw the stock close rally back to close at the 21 day-exp-mov-avg (the mkt standard for the past couple years).  IMO the chart looks like the near and long-term Bull case is still intact.   (That view will change if I start seeing some institutional selling.)More,Michael,,0,0

I'm long since August 17th and currently own 2950 shares and averaged in at $19.26.  I've already collected $1680 in dividends and expect to be collecting another $3687 soon.  Barring an unforseen event I intend to hold with the xpectation that over the next year I will collect anothe $4 per share in dividends and that the share prices will rise to $30.

As we highlighted here, SBLK reported record 3Q results, announcing a $1.25 per share dividend for the quarter, bringing the year-to-date dividends to $2.25. The dividends reflect an average rate of $23,000 per day through 3Q. Based on the booked days for 4Q and current spot rates, we expect higher EBITDA and increase to the dividend payout. As such, we are revising our 4Q EBITDA estimate to $318M. We are also expecting a stronger 2022 (Q1’21 was relatively weak) and we are revising our 2022 estimates. Based on the dry bulk demand and supply dynamics, we raise our 2022 EBITDA estimate to $850M. Maintain Buy.More,c,,15,2

4 months ago,During the Q3 conference call management indicated that they were expecring rates to turn up over the short term.  My expectation is that they will take rising rates as an opportunity to add to the previously reported 17% of rate fixtures for Q1 already reported.  Since 71% of Q4 is set at a great rate the current rise in rates will help the blend.  While I was a little skeptical when some thought a $1.75-$2.00 dividend was possible for Q4, current rising rates are helping that case.  I'm hopeful that management will put out a press release prior to years end giving an update on fixed rates for Q4 and Q1.  Management has been doing a great job fixing rates thus far and I don't think this has gone unnoticed by investors.More,George,,5,1

If there is a dip again under 20 I'll pick up another quarter position and just sort of average into this one.   I expect about $2.25 div over the next two quarters.    Short term anything under $20 and you are getting the company for less than book value considering the dividends coming up.   It is a simple way to look at it. I love buying profitable companies at the tangible book value.   Because from my perspective that means all future earnings go right to my pocket.  And in theory I should always be able to sell a profitable company for at least book value.  So it is kind of a floor.   When it comes to shipping companies here is why its even better.  Even at end of life the steel is worth quite a bit.   So yea a well managed business, at book value, making tons of cash.    What is not to love right here.

4 months ago,While it would be premature to break out the champagne todays action has the feel of a break out for the bulkers.  SBLK's actions may have had a hand in changing the sentiment because they were early in paying out a generous dividend and went on record in their committment to continue it.  One or two companies committing to share with stockholders might go unnoticed but many of the bulkers have joined the dividend club.  Let's hope that this activity catches the eye of a new group of investors and that they check us out and like what they see.  Most, if not all of the bulkers are undervalued given their metrics.  The sector has been in the dog house for such a long period of time so market rotation is long overdue.

4 months ago,Given that the decline in December Capesize 5TC futures has flattened out at around $30K/day and in Panamax 4TC futures at $22K/day, let's say that their combined TCE for Q4 is going to be $25K/day. Since SBLK has locked in 71% of Q4 at $38825/day, the expected TCE in Q4 is something like 0.71*38250 + 0.29*25 = $34.5K/day, so if we had to predict Q4 cash from operations, a 10% increase relative to Q3 is a good starting point, which gives us around $275m.To calculate the expected dividend for Q4, we'll start by adding $275m to $243m left over from Q2 (shown on slide 5 of their earnings presentation), then will subtract $53m for debt repayment and capex (if they stay the same as in Q3, as shown on Slide 4), then will subtract the minimum cash reserve of $2.1M*128 = $269m, and we'll be left with 275+243-53-269 = 196m. Dividing this by 102m shares, we get a dividend of around $1.92 per share. This is the base case. The management also mentioned in the earnings call transcript that they plan to sell a couple of ships to raise money for completing the share buyback, which will both decrease the minimum cash reserve and the number of shares by which the money is divided. If the buyback is completed in Q4, the dividend will be above $2.00 per share. In reality, I expect SBLK to repay more debt in Q4 than in Q3, since $1.25/share dividend is plenty (more than 25% annual yield!). The bottom line is that the company will be doing BOTH great things: paying HUGE dividends AND reducing its debt (thus increasing NAV and expected share price, since many analysts are pricing SBLK off its NAV).More,DavidV,,15,0

4 months ago,It's the weekend, no market, little sector news.  No need to read any further if you're seeking hard facts and not willing to speculate with other longs on what is the best use of the considerable cash that the company is generating.  I believe that managements objctive is identical to we shareholders, namely, seeking total return.  Some believe that the focus should be on debt reduction, some on buy backs, some on fleet expansion and others think that managements focus on a generous dividend is mistaken.  The argument against the generous dividend seems logical, namely, the market hasn;t rewarded the generous policy so it must be a failure.  I say, It's much too soon to make that judgement because these generous dividends are a fairly recent phenomenom.  Consider the long history of shipping.  There was a time when the sector had a well earned reputation of being a good reliable source of interest income.  Stocks were valued significantly higher than currently, largely because of generous dividends.  That's a decade or more in the past.  Skepticism has had a long time to ferment, thus, low valuations despite the recent over the top performance.  Others are not yet convinced that the sector's improvement is not transitory so we early arrivers may have to be patient.  There are some that believe that the sector has failed because of an unsound business model, specifically, the paying out of generous dividends were unsustainable.  Perhaps they are right but I disagree.  It is my belief that the failure was caused by the over ordering of unneeded vessels, (Supply-Demand).  Looking at the rate fluctuation shoul at least give some credence to my position.  Getting back  to SBLK and managements tactics.  The generous dividend approach needs more time before judging it a failure because of the investment community's distrust of the sector.  This distrust may abate sooner rather than later because many other bulkers are also sharply increasing dividends.  We just have to give it a little more time.  Our management team is fully on board with this policy and have been so emphatic about it that some may have taken offense at the language used in expressing this entusiasm.  Also, we're not a one trick pony in that we're retiring debt early and have a decent share buy back set aside in place with an articulated plan on how to increase it.  With 128 vessels, we're the largest fleet so we really don't need to increase the fleet but management has expressed a willingness to grow if a deal presents itself that would enhance we shareholders.  I saved the best for last.  I find this management team to be very candid and honest in setting out goals and keeping shareholders abreast on how they intend to reach them.  When questioned by analysts, they give complete answers, frequently giving more detail than anticipated.  While I like and trust management, I always closely scrutinize words with deeds.If I have it wrong, shoot me down, I won't take it personally.More,George,,7,0

4 months ago,Takeaway's from the Q3 conference call have previously been posted but these are a few that haven't been mentioned.  The net income of $224.7 that led to the $2.20 earnings per share was made possible by the $30,626 TCE realized for the quarter.  The company announced that they locked in 71 per cent of the fleet for Q4 at $ 38,250 per vessel.  That huge number guarantees another extremely proifable quarter when Q 4 is reported.. For Q1  17 % of the fleet has been hedged at $32,000 per vessel and the company intends to increase this number over the next several weeks  because they expect some recovery in rates over the short term.  They spent about $10M on buy backs in the $22 area and it seems that they will spend the remaining $40M of the $50M set aside in short order.  If additional funds are needed for additional buy backs it will be funded by older vessel sales.For those that have the time or inclination I highly recommend listening to the cc or reading the transcript.  Management does a great job in disemanating info and you will get a feel for how high they are on the market.From the EGLE conference call, vessel values increased 110 per cent over the last year based on the sale of 890 vessels sold during that period of time.More,George,,0,0

4 months ago,So, I opened a starter (quarter position) near the end of the bell.   I haven't listened to the conference call yet but will do so this evening.  Troubling that the bulk index is still moving downward.  I'm thinking the worst case is this stock goes to 10 and I can average down (that price assumes eps of .80 to !1.00 per share annually).   Best case is that Bulk Index rates find the bottom and pop up above 3000.    If anything I figure the quickly dropping bulk has probably but the stop on anyone thinking of ordering new builds.  What is pretty cool is just how much the earnings scales up when the prices pop.   There costs hardly budge and all the rate goes right to the bottom line.  So basically it is all about the day rates.    I figure we have  another good div. coming next quarter too.  Ultimately where to bulk rates settle.More,Gene,,1,0

Average daily earnings for capesizes, which transport 150K-ton cargoes such as iron ore and coal, fell to $28,059, and average daily earnings for panamaxes, which ferry 60K-70K-ton coal or grain cargoes, slumped to $24,072.,Flip,,1,1

4 months ago,So, OK I went over the earnings report.  Wow, it was a really nice quarter.   With the data we now have we should be able to draw up some models of where eps will be based on average dayrates.   The dividend is indeed going to be very nice for those who are holding the stock on Ex-Div.  I still think they could have done say $1.00 per share and used the rest to strengthen the balance sheet further.Speaking of the balance sheet it is a bit confusing.   They bought back a lot of shares yet the Average weighted shares outstanding are up versus a year ago and even versus the trailing 9 month average.  So I assume there were shares issued in the 1st or 2nd quarter.   Share buybacks were very nice plenty of authorization left to go.Was also a bit confused on debt.  The cash flow statement clearly shows they paid down more debt than they drew.   Yet the balance sheet shows the debt has increased a bit.   So that doesn't make any sense.   The good news is that their refinancing efforts have paid off very well and interest expenses were down considerably.   And of course earnings per share were outstanding for one quarter.   As for what share price will do or how much it should be valued going forward I guess it all depends on where a person thinks long term bulk index prices will be.   I will probably try to go ahead and buy a small starter position tomorrow in the 19 +/- 0.3 range.   Then sort of just see what happens with rates.    If they go up great my small position does well.  If they go down I can average down into it a bit.   I'll probably also listen to the conference call before I do anything.  Should be interesting to see what they have to say regarding market outlook, ship building orders, and whether they locked in any rates.   Overall things feel bullish.More,Gene,,11,0

Folks need to return to the last conference call from SBLK, and many of the other recent bulk CEO statements.  There is a systemic situation whereby vessel utilization will be very high for years to come owing to underlying enduring (not weekly transitory) factors.It may very be that the trade over coming weeks is to be on he sidelines, but the longer term trade is to be weighted in this sector, relative to any other shipping sector.And even if shares temporarily, decline 20% further, they will recover and in the interim deliver 10-15% payout.More,martin,,6,2

4 months ago,Well what I'm going to post here is a totally selfish wishful thinking.   But based on today's price action and the dry bulk index clearly tanking I suspect that some holders will sell into what I think will be a 1.00 dividend.   So I'm staying on the sidelines here.  I don't own any shares but I've been looking at this stock for months now.   If management has locked in high rates the stock will pop regardless and I'll be wrong.  Hopefully they have locked in a portion of the fleet in either case cause I think the top is in now on the bulk index.   I think they should just offer a steady dividend based on the cash flows they've had over the last five years or so.    Take the wind fall cash flows and continue to pay down debts or simply hoard cash.   But I agree with an earlier poster.  Set the company up here for the long term so everything is predictable going forward.   Hopefully they rode the spot price up and locked in a few nice rates.    Either way the company should be fine.  It looks like the bulk dry index is going to  settle back down to where it has been over the last five years.  I'm going to buy in when the stock settle back into that range of $10 -12.   That is why I'm hoping they will simply strengthen the companies balance sheet.I suspect after dry bulk settles into its old range it will POP up again.   Right now china is slowing the question is for how long.   Will they need coal if their economy rebounds?    Iron Ore is a big question mark.   Though the US could definitely use it right now.   The whole market is strange for sure.  One day we are worried about massive inflation and the next a deflationary contagion.    I still think the Federal Reserve should stop buying bonds.  Just let interest rates float for a bit.  Geesh...   I don't think the interference at this point is helping anything and the markets all over the world need to start adjusting to the real time cost of money instead this craziness.   I think even the average consumer gets it that things are bit strange.More,Gene,,2,1

The market knows that rates in the third quarter were very high and the company made a fortune.  That is all but priced in.  The price action recently reflects the decline in rates over the last few weeks.The only thing that company can say or do to buck the trend is to demonstrate increased resilience for earnings through the cycle, strike the right tone on uses of cash (dividends/buybacks/debt/fleet growth), articulate thoughts on when they would issue equity (hopefully never), and highlight what their level of rates are for the upcoming few quarters (i.e. are they all spot as they have historically been, have they locked in some term at higher levels, etc.).  If they post great earnings and rates keep moving lower, the earnings report won't really matter (similar to them posting bad earnings and rates going up would likely drive the stock higher).More,jmc,,7,3

4 months ago,Its this extreme volatility in dry bulk shipping rates that has caused investors and mutual funds to shy away from this sector.  Only hedge funds venture here, and they play on their own terms.  You'll notice the several private equity and hedge funds that swooped into the sect when shares trade below 50% NAV, and now have exited as share trade close to 100% NAV.If you believe CEOs, this is the dawn of a golden age for dry bulk in which demand is steady and growing, supply of vessels is a constrained, environmental regulations will force players of non-compliant vessels to scrap, and financing is hard to get for most.But the reality is that China and its policies has such a huge bearing on this sector, that even with all the above market forces, its political clout reigns supreme - and is mostly unpredictable.More,martin,,5,2

4 months ago,Sometimes I get lucky.   So I've been mulling buying a position in SBLK for several weeks now.    At the peak I noticed the dry bulk index had dipped.   I said I'd hold off on buying until it looked stable.  Well it has just kept dropping and dropping.   So I haven't bought in yet. So I have a puzzle.   The bulk dry index is a falling knife right now, but SBLK should be about to announce a blow the doors off earnings report and what should be a good dividend.   Dry Bulk Index is now around $2800 but its been down 10 straight sessions.   Not sure what market will do.  But I think I will just wait till it turns.  We still have another week or two before earnings are reported.   Seems like a good company in a very unfavored sector which is probably unfavored for good reasons.  Lots of bad operators out there.More,Gene,,4,0

4 months ago,The Motley Fool article on yesterday's drop had an interesting tidbit: Earlier this morning, a third dry bulk shipping company, Seanergy Marine, reported earnings that beat analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings. Seanergy commented that the highest market levels of the last 12 years in the Capesize sector -- the largest class of dry bulk carriers -- saw daily chartering rates reach $87,000 a day at the start of the fourth quarter. And despite seeing those market levels decline over the past few weeks, Seanergy views this drop as a "short-term correction."  SBLK has 22 Capesize so hopefully they are getting similar rates.More,Bri,,8,0

4 months ago,Step up, boys and girls, and collect your shares at bargain-basement prices!! Yes, the Baltic Dry Index has been taking hits right and left and across the bow. The index of dry bulk rates has been trading down in sympathy with Chinese curbs on steel production amid the power crisis (which has brought iron ore demand way down). But in my humble opinion, we have now seen the worst of this trend already unfold. Iron ore demand won't go down forever and will be on the uptrend once again soon. SBLK is down too much here. It has a broad portfolio of dry bulk ships, many of whose classes have not seen their rates come down too much compared to the Capesize class. Yes, SBLK has many Capesize vessels also, but those are still the highest-earning ships and still raking in huge profits every day even with rates down off their highs. SBLK just announced its earnings date of Nov 16. It will be reporting record, blow-out earnings and significantly increasing its upcoming dividend yet again. This dip is just what the sector needed before the inevitable resumption of the uptrend.More,Value Finder,,0,0

4 months ago,My expectation is that they will announce a $1.20 dividend on November 16th.  During the Q3 conference call on the 17th they should be reporting how many shares were repurchased and at what average for the quarter.  Normally, during the Q3 conference call the company reports what percentage, if any, of the fleet has been set going forward and at what average TCE.  During the Q2 conference call management was very bullish on rates going forward and it is unlikely that this decline in rates will change their viewpoint.  For those that have the time or inclination I highly recommend listening to the conference call because much can be learned during the Q and A portion of it.  In the past the Analysts really dug deep and management was more than willing to supply in depth answers to all questions.  In my opinion this management team is Best Of Breed.More,George,,5,3

If there were, it seems like some of this noise that continues to create a cloud above this symbol could be easily modeled and explained away.The most important thing to do for this stock is for the management team to communicate better with investors.  They simply could not declare a cash dividend for less than $0.75/Share for Q3 2021,  Even if they beat the street bt 25%, the stock would still still lose 35% because they would lose all of the dividend investors.  There is no reasonable reason to not increase their dividends as their earnings, financial,fundamentals, and earnings  are strong, (assuming the hit in Q3).My Outlook:  I'll probably doubledown (dollar cost average down) at the current price and then wait for the earnings call. 6 Ni=Month:More,Alpha Investor,,8,0

5 months ago,Hedge Funds Are Piling Into Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (SBLK)Published on October 25, 2021 at 3:27 pm by ASMA UL HUSNA in Hedge Funds, NewsHedge funds and large money managers usually invest with a focus on the long-term horizon and, therefore, short-lived dips or bumps on the charts usually don’t make them change their opinion towards a company. This time it may be different. The coronavirus pandemic destroyed the high correlations among major industries and asset classes. We are now in a stock pickers market where fundamentals of a stock have more effect on the price than the overall direction of the market. As a result we observe sudden and large changes in hedge fund positions depending on the news flow. Let’s take a look at the hedge fund sentiment towards Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ:SBLK) to find out whether there were any major changes in hedge funds’ views.Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ:SBLK) has experienced an increase in hedge fund sentiment recently. Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ:SBLK) was in 24 hedge funds’ portfolios at the end of the second quarter of 2021. The all time high for this statistic was previously 19. This means the bullish number of hedge fund positions in this stock currently sits at its all time high. There were 13 hedge funds in our database with SBLK positions at the end of the first quarter.More,c,,2,2

5 months ago,As some have previously stated, we've seen this sell off prior to earnings release before.  What I am hoping to see, is that the company has repurchased a meaningfull number of shares during these ceclines.  They have $50 million set aside for this purpose but I wold like to see them dipping into their more than ample reserves to do a massive buy back.  They have previously stated that they wouldn'y be dipping into profits designated for dividends to fund buy backs but some of the Analysts that folow the company closely seem to think that management could reduce reserves a bit for other purposes.  Management expressed that the sale of a few older vessels could possibly fund more share buy backs but that the determining factor would always be, what is best for shareholders.  Best for shareholders is a recurring theme in there discussions and I will believe this until I find it to be untrue.  Believe but verify is my position but I am alway careful in checking statments with actions.  I think SBLK is best of breed, mainly because of a more than candid management team plus better than decent assets and costs.More,George,,5,0

I held calls through the last ex-div, hoping they would be adjusted, but they weren't and they just dropped in price. By analogy, wouldn't deep in-the-money puts jump up in price by the div amount?

5 months ago,@ James.  Trying to understand short perspective :).   what do you think fair multiple is for 2021 earnings.  I heard you mention $18 share price implying 3.25x Multiple of 2021 earnings, and 2.5x of 2022 earnings.  I say even 8x is way too low (implying a 45/share price) MGMT has too many options with its cash to warrant a 3.25 multiple.  They could extinguish debt and be debt free next year.  They could sell a few ships and buy back stock with the money.  (book value at mark to market is 21/share lol).  They could buy companies that accelerate EPS going forward.  SBLK deserves a 12x multiple (implying a 70/share price)More,EDIZZLE,,5,0

5 months ago,A modern drybulk fleet typically means having vessels less than 15 yrs old.    The cost of maintaining the older fleets of vessels rises considerably, with more frequent surveys.  The IMO 2030 standards will pretty much remove the effective operations of vessels that today are in the pre-2010 age group.SBLK is facing a significant renewal cycle.  Unless they elect to shrink.Especially problematic is their Pana-class fleet.  Consisting of about 50 vessels, 19 will be 16 yrs or older in 2022. Six of their Capes are age 15 to 18.The typical lifetime of these vessels is not much more than 20yrs, but new standards and eco-requirements will make those obselete sooner. Of course, other bulk owners have even older vessels, but not so much among the listed NYSE drybulk companies.Of those listed, SBLK has the oldest fleet. So les do some math.  If SBLK elected to renew their Pana/Kamsa class, the capital cost would be about $800M (gross cost with financing of $40M/per vessel).  The good news is that the current market value of those old used vessels is high, perhaps $12-$15M.  Lets assume these carry $5M in debt, then the sale of them raises about $170M, leaving $630M in new build capital.   Of course, the lost revenue in time is also a important consideration since they would remove 15% of their on-the-water fleet for 2+yrs.The bottom line - retain more FCF, and use that to renew the fleet, and perhaps retain the exiting older vessels in this strong market time. Rather than paying $1.20/sh in Q3 and $2/sh in Q4, retaining even 1/2 of those would build $160M in cash, while sill paying a very generous dividend.More,martin,,1,1

5 months ago,"I have heard from numerous business owners that it used to cost them, on average, around $2,000 to ship a large container of goods on a cargo ship. Today, that number is 10 times higher.The combination of surges in demand, broken supply chains, and labor shortages has resulted in skyrocketing prices for global shipping companies. This is great news for their shareholders – especially the ones who like dividends.For example, take small-cap Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (Nasdaq: SBLK), which operates out of Athens, Greece. It paid a $0.70 per share quarterly dividend last month, which comes out to a sky-high 12.3% yield on an annual basis.But can the company continue to deliver such a high yield the way its 128 vessels deliver goods around the world?Last year, Star Bulk Carriers generated $98.5 million in free cash flow but paid out only $4.8 million in dividends. As cash flow increases this year to an expected $586.6 million, dividends paid is forecast to come out to $325.1 million."-TalkMarkets, Oct 13, 2021More,c,,0,0

5 months ago,Massif Capital has the right idea, read my previous post, but for those who want the nitty gritty fast they say this:"If rates hold, which we expect them to do, we couldsee a 20+% annual dividend year next year for SBLK. If the market priced the equity suchthat the dividend yield was 8%, that implies a $62 stock."I am happy to sit back, collect the growing dividend and wait for this to unfold over the next 12-18 months.More,c,,0,0
5 months ago,Massif Capital opened a new position in SBLK and wrote the following in their 3rd quarter shareholder newsletter last week:SBLK has one of the better management teams in the maritime shipping industry and thelowest cost structure among all dry bulk names. After announcing their new dividend policyin May, SBLK now has one of the best payout structures in shipping. The firm has paid out$0.3 and $0.7 per share in dividends for the first and second quarters of 2021. SBLK willmost likely announce a dividend for the third quarter somewhere in the $1.15-$1.25 pershare range, depending on movement in net working capital.We believe the best way to look at this business is through cash generation potential andhow much is returned to investors. The current equity valuation does not reflect currentrates for shipping (earnings), partly because of the velocity of the move in rates and because shipping cycles turn, and it’s not clear whether this is a local top or the early inningsof a multi-year cycle. Our belief is the latter. Part of our catalyst is the market re-rating thestock higher once the length of the increased earnings power becomes understood. It is arelatively strong catalyst in the sense that with a strong dividend policy, we can be patientfor the market to underwrite this story as the cash is either returned to us via a high dividend yield if the market is either slow or chooses not to join our side of the trade.Our estimates suggest a time-charter equivalent rate (net profit or loss of operating avessel daily) of at least $30,000 for SBLK in Q4, with the firm earning a potential annual average of $26,000. Our base case is that this is a strong floor going into next year, with littleneed to articulate much more upside. If rates hold, which we expect them to do, we couldsee a 20+% annual dividend year next year for SBLK. If the market priced the equity suchthat the dividend yield was 8%, that implies a $62 stock. Today our base case target for the firm is $37 per share. This is likely conservative as we know that third-quarter rates are higher than the second quarter, and third-quarter dividends will most likely reflect that. We are cautious about diving too deep into the sensitivities to the upside with this position as we are arriving at some pretty remunerative torque using current contracted values andseemingly conservative forecasts.Sustained earnings are core to our thesis and need to be further explained. Problems arisein the dry bulk industry when aggregate supply overshoots demand from eager ownersflush with cash looking to grow their fleet. We saw this in 2007-2008 and again in 2012-2013. Today, the overgrowth from 2013 has been worked through by demand growth andscraping. The order-book to total fleet ratio is at historic lows and is key to an upswingcycle.Rates are high, companies are cash-rich, and the order-to-fleet ratio is bottoming. This is aunique situation, perhaps unprecedented. Are we making an error in initiating an investment here? Investment managers with tunnel vision on high earnings in a cyclical industryhave been wrong-footed before (we’ve made that mistake). A couple of facts accompanythis low ratio which makes the forward prognosis intriguing.First, there is zero evidence the newbuild ordering is picking up. At the start of the year, theorderbook-to-fleet ratio was 7.8% for Capesize ships and 6.8% for Panamax ships. Historically, we have seen owners running to the shipyards as soon as earnings increase. Yet today(~8 months after the earnings started increasing), we see Capesize ratios at 5.9% and Panamax at 6.15%. The orderbook is contracting despite an increasingly cash-rich environment, which is highly unusual.Why is this? Part of the reason is that if one wants to order a ship today, they cannot expect delivery until ~2024. The container shipping companies have been in a rush to buildmore container ships (a trend starting in the fall of 2020) and have filled all available birthspaces at shipyards for at least three years. Second, large new orders are being placedon hold principally because of uncertainties in environmental regulations and specificallyout of concern of building ships with the wrong propulsion systems given potential futureregulations.We know that the first significant piece of IMO carbon-related environmental regulationcomes into play in 2023 and will require a 40% reduction in emissions (vs. 2008 levels) by2030. But revisions and updates to proposals (and adopted amendments) have not slowed.In June 2021, the IMO amended MARPOL to introduce an Energy Efficiency Design Index(coming into force in January 2023). But the details have been deferred until November ofthis year. There is also a proposal outstanding for a bunker fuel tax. In short, it is an uncertain regulatory environment in which most companies feel uncomfortable shelling out $59million for a new ship.----continued ----More,c,,8,1

5 months ago,If concensus estimates are accurate through 12/22 and earnings for the first 2 quarters of 2023 are 1.26 per quarter  dividends will be 4.13 for next 12 months and 3.02 for following 12 months. . If earnings are 1.00 per quarter thereafter and share price is 6x we have share price of 24.00. This must be how the big boys are looking at it. You get an 18per cent dividend next 12 months and 13 per cent dividend the next 12 months and a flat share price at end of two years. Those estimated earnings are 2.06 for 09/21 and 1.83 for 12/21.

Feels like trading range will narrow from 23-25 for the next few weeks, then maybe start to climb as the quarterly release comes out in 4 weeks.  Folks, its entirely possible that q4 will have a .5 B net income, which is wild considering its entire market cap was only .5 B 18 months ago! can you imagine printing in cash its entire market cap in a single quarter?  Its possible NI will be .5 B with a $3 dividend in q4.  Looking forward though, I think Mgt needs to figure out if there is a better return to shareholders than dividends. The problem with dividends on wall St. implies your company has a low ROI.  We get that ROI is low when the asset markets are high, but perhaps there are other ways to diversify and other areas to invest the cash besides dividends.  For instance, SBLK could take the cash generated in q4, and go the George Economou route, that is to aquire 3 Offshore Drill Ships at 30% equity 70% debt, and add $4/share/Year in EBITA going forward.More,EDIZZLE,,0,0

Capesize dry-bulk rates could soften as power cuts affect steel production, lowering China's iron-ore imports. (10/05/21)1. Higher Demand May Drive Dry-Bulk and LNG RatesDry-bulk and LNG shipping rates could keep rising alongside soaring coal and LNG prices in the coming months as China shores up its energy supplies to cater for the upcoming heating season and the Winter Olympics in Beijing. Panamax vessels, the main ship class for coal transport, could be the key beneficiary of greater coal demand, potentially driving the Baltic Panamex Index to outperform the Baltic Dry and Capesize Indices this winter, after underperforming this year through September.Star Bulk, COSCO group and Nippon Yusen are among the five largest Panamex owners in the world, while Mitsui OSK is the top LNG carrier globally.

W/o he reserve requirement beginning in 2022, they would have distributed about 0.90/sh.  On an annualized basis, that is $3.60/shThe headlines are all about the CAPE rates, now near $80K/day. That will help goose SBLK earnings in Q4, the thinking is that CAPE rates will average 50% lower in 2022, and that is how SBLK is being valued.More,martin,,0,0

In its latest weekly report, shipbroker Intermodal commented that “the unfolding last week of a trilateral defence pact between the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom (AUKUS) envisages a wide range of collaboration, but at its core is an agreement to start consultations to help Australia acquire a fleet of nuclear-propelled submarines. Believe AUKUS is an interesting development in the context of the already intensified geopolitical tensions between Australia and China, which have already led to a shift in trading patterns, particularly as far as dry bulk trade is concerned.Source: IntermodalAccording to Intermodal’s Mr. Christopher Whitty, Director of Towage and Marine Port Services, “in particular, China’s ban on Australian coal since Q42020 has triggered inefficiencies in coal trading, with wide price arbitrages developing between China and the rest of the world for both metallurgical coal used by the steel industry and thermal coal used in power generation. The supply tightness has been more severe on metallurgical coal, the price of which has surged to record high levels, with China scrambling for supplies simulateneously with the rest of the world, steel production of which continues to grow. Australia is the world’s largest met coal exporter (approx. 59.0% of global seaborne met coal exports) and 2nd thermal coal exporter (approx. 22.0% of global seaborne thermal coal exports). China’s coking coal imports from Australia have come down to zero YTD 2021 vs a more than 50% share in imports during the previous two years. Imports from Mongolia so far have failed to meet increased demand amid COVID related supply disruptions and China had to increase its met coal imports share from Russia and the West (particularly the US and Canada), the last traditionally being primariy origins of imports for Europe. On the other hand, Australia coking coal is absorbed by steel mills outside China, as global steel production excl. the latter is up 16.0+% y-o-y (YTD Jan-Jul) and Australia coking coal has turned out cheaper than US coking coal despite the overall price surge. This trade shift has increased ton-miles and dry bulk fleet inefficiencies supporting Atlantic freight rates higher for longer”.More,martin,,5,1

6 months ago,I think what gets lost in the drybulk story, among the remarkable daily succession of new decadal highs for shipping rates, is that SBLK makes a tremendous amount of money if the rates were only 1/2 the current spot rates.For example, 1/2 of today's spot rates (50% reduction from today) would imply a fleet average near TCE of about $20,000/day.  In Q2, when rates were their TCE was close to that ($22K/day),  they earned $1.27/sh.They paid over $100M down in their debt, increased their cash reserve, and paid 0.70/sh in dividends for the quarter, all at TCEs much much lower than today.Then, with Q3 and Q4 2021 alone, they will further reduce their debt, probably to near $1B by end of year, and also build a reserve of over $250M, reducing net debt to $750M.  Their net debt at the beginning of the year was closer to $1.7B.  That is an incredible deleveraging cycle!All that happens while likely paying over $3/sh in dividends ($300M) to shareholders over the next 2 quarters.There is every reason to believe that SBLK could approach net zero debt in 2022.That is also the goal of GNK- but  by year end (another large US listed, and US domiciled major dry bulk shipper). GNK is paying little to shareholders at the time, till they achieve net zero debt.  The effect of this effort to all but illuminate their debt is to reduce  cash flow break-even such that they become profitable even if shipping rate return to their lows of 2-4 yrs ago. And during this period today, with the order book only 5% of existing fleet, beginning Q12022, there is little threat of the owners themselves scuttling the strong fundamentals in the market.  Its not that they have become disciplined, but that IMO standards make it difficult to invest except for the largest companies willing to risk investment in new build technology whose standards haven't been set.  Little if any speculative  ordering of drybulk vessels  is happening at the moment.  This is remarkable in its own right, since the market is at 12-yr highs. All trades are happing in sales of second hand vesselsThe consequence of this low order book?  Existing vessel values are rising.   The average drybuk 10-yr old vessel value has risen 70-90% in the past year.   When we move through the 2H2021, look for more value gain in the prices.  SBLK owns a fleet of 128 vessels, average age 9 yrs or so.   If their averaged booked value was $10M per vessel on 1Jan 2021, it will be $20M per vessel on 1Jan 2022.  That is a increase in NAV of over $1.3B, or $13/sh jump in underlying value of the company's assets alone.  Today's share price, compared to 1January 2021 has risen barely in step with the rise in its NAV, let alone with its $1B reduction (by year end) in net debt (another $10/sh), and its issuance of huge payout to shareholders.More,martin,,14,2

6 months ago,Iron ore and shipping costs...Bulk shipping costs have constraints, e.g the cost and margins on the commodity being traded.  If the shipping cost removes the profit on the trade for the commodity end market, then the shipping cost must decline.  of course the dynamic can be tricky depending on the demand for the product itself. The point raised at BTIG today by Greg Lewis is the coupling of these, and that Cape rates (which mostly haul ore) may see an air pocket, barring increased ore demand that drives the commodity price higher (now 50% off its earlier 2021 prices...)More,martin,,1,0

6 months ago,Summary from today, on Hellenic Shipping News...————Baltic index extends rally, hits 12-year high on gains across vesselsin Dry Bulk Market,International Shipping News 21/09/2021The Baltic Exchange’s main dry bulk sea freight index rose to a 12-year high on Monday, as rates across vessel segments jumped on robust demand and global shipping constraints.The overall index, which factors in rates for capesize, panamax, supramax and handysize vessels, rose 29 points at 4,304, its highest since Nov. 24, 2009.Analysts have attributed the recent rally in the dry bulk market to global shipping constraints and an overall rebound in commodities demand.“Dry bulk ships are spending a lot more time waiting outside of ports, both because there are so many ships and also due to the new (pandemic-led) quarantine measures around the world,” said Emily Stausboll, shipping analyst at BIMCO, that adding various economic stimulus measures are also helping dry bulk demand.The factors that have been driving the market “won’t disappear overnight,” and (seasonally) dry bulk market tends to perform best at the end of the year” before easing off into the start of next year, Stausboll added.The capesize index increased 67 points, or 1%, to 6,487, a peak since December 2009.Average daily earnings for capesizes, which transport 150,000-tonne cargoes such as iron ore and coal, increased $555 to $53,795.Among smaller vessels, the supramax index rose for a sixth straight session, adding 12 points to 3,319, highest in over two-weeks.The panamax index rose for an eighth straight session, adding 12 points, or 0.3%, to 3,916, it highest in over two-months.Average daily earnings for panamaxes, which ferry 60,000-70,000 tonne coal or grain cargoes, increased $102 to $35,240.More,martin,,9,2

6 months ago,$75M in additional free cash flow is expected in Q3 for SBLK.That is based on their statement of 2/3 charter rates secured by 6 Aug at above $28K/day.  With stronger subsequent rates, it is likely that their Q3 rates will be close to $29K/day.  That will be about $6500/day above Q2.  By their own guidance on free cash flow sensitivity, a $6500/day increment implies an boast of $300M annualized FCF ($75M per quarter).  That leaves 0.75/sh of additional distributable dividends in Q3.The Q2 payout was 0.70/sh.  This was after $25M of FCF in Q2 was used to build equity in their fleet.  Guidance indicates that about $30M in equity build is planned for Q3.  That would leave about 0.70/sh of the enhanced FCF in Q3 for dividends, about Q2 payout.The net result is that Q3 dividend is likely to be about $1.40/sh (give or take 0.20/sh).Q4 shipping contracts are already being secured, and if the current spot rates hold their current levels for the next 6-8 weeks (by which time their entire spot fleet will have received new fixtures), their fleet charter rates should average near $33K to $36K/day.  An additional $5000/day above Q3 rates would generate about an extra $50M in FCF.  The market is such that SBLK is likely to flirt with a $2/sh dividend in Q4.None of these rather remarkable numbers, by any historical standard, is making any outlandish assumptions on near-future rates.More,martin,,13,1

6 months ago,Stifel Maritime Update (issue yesterday...)This is a lengthy, but interesting read.  In their view, SBLK valued at 6 x EV/EBITDA (a modest historical valuation), and assuming the current 1-Yr rates on dry bulk vessels, would price them at $49/sh.   When they apply the 2007/2008 last peak rates (which they dont expect, but dont discount entirely on a short term  basis), would price SBLK at $163/sh._____The Pieces Of The Dry Bulk Puzzle - What Is Real And What Is Myth  Summary Dry bulk shipping rates (and equities) have been trending higher all year long on the back of good underlying demand for the transportation of commodities, but also exogenous factors like COVID-related inefficiencies of ports and ships and spillover demand from containerized freight into dry bulk demand. While data on both of these other dynamics is challenging to quantify, we have surveyed many of the leading public and private dry bulk shipping companies on the impact of these two variables on their businesses. While the impacts vary from company to company depending on ship type, both fleet inefficiencies and container spillover are having only a minor impact with respect to actually supply/demand balance. However, with an already tight market, the incremental impacts are exacerbating rate movements, and we expect going into the winter months, the impact and tightness are likely to accelerate.  Key Points • Demand for commodities is primarily driving market tightness. The price of almost all commodities transported by sea is elevated backed by strong demand for those commodities. As a result, the production of steel, coal, aluminum, cement, fertilizers, etc. continues to rise driving the need for increased transportation. We estimate that total dry bulk volume growth should be about 3% higher than 2019 (pre-COVID) levels. There is further pressure on ton-miles (average distance traveled) thanks to continued recovery in Brazilian iron ore output, challenged Sino-Australian relations pushing more North American coal to Asia, and drought conditions in South America. • Container capacity spillover. The cost of ship goods in containers is currently about 600% higher than normalized levels. Add to that challenges in accessing containers and massive supply chain delays, and excess cargo has spilled over into the dry bulk shipping segment. While it appears unlikely many dry bulk ships will actually carry containers, the goods in those containers are being loaded directly into smaller dry bulk ships. We expect this is translating into an additional 2% demand growth. •Port Congestion. There are likely few people in the world who have not heard words like "supply chain constraint", "port congestion", and "shipping delays" in recent months. While this is primarily impacting container shipping, issues with harbor pilots, stevedores, and crew switching, have slowed the loading and discharge of goods. While other factors are also in play like the types of cargoes being transported, on average dry bulk ships in harbor or dry docking vs those in transit appear to be closer to 15% of the fleet versus a normal average of 10%. On a tonnage basis the impact is not as severe, but still effectively removes shipping capacity just as demand is surging. •These issues are likely to be sticky. Container craziness should abate, although we expect not until some time later next year or perhaps even in 2023. Consequently, we expect the spillover of container volumes to persist, and the same is likely true to supply inefficiencies. Eventually, those factors should ease, however, we expect organic dry bulk shipping demand to continue to rise, and thus that rise has not been met by a significant amount of new vessel ordering. While an eventual unwind of these tangential issues could eventually ease market tightness, we expect the new normal to be at a healthy rate and cash flow levels, and even that not until 2023. •Parabolic rates. There is a magic place in dry bulk and all commodity ships at which demand rises, but supply is unable to adjust and the only response is upward pressure on rates. We are now at that moment and all the slack has been worked out of the system, idle ships are fully deployed, ships are generally going close to full speed, and the cargo count continues to grow. Limited ordering means ship supply growth will be little more than a trickle for at least two years, and cargo counts are likely to outweigh ship supply for at least the next 18 months. Price is the only lever left to move, and we expect there could be spikes to the already tight rate environment which could potentially (and temporarily) cause a doubling or tripling from currently healthy levels and on balance translate into exceptionally strong returns and higher share prices.More,martin,,10,0

6 months ago,Ship Owner Says Commodity Freight Rates Close to Going ParabolicBy&nbsp;Alex Longley(Bloomberg) --&nbsp;An owner of commodity hauling freighters said rates for the ships are close to the point of spiking sharply higher and mirroring an unprecedented surge in costs for transporting manufactured goods.Spot rates for container ships to move manufactured products have surged for 20 straight weeks and now stand 731% above their seasonal average over the prior five years, according to Drewry Shipping.&nbsp;John Wobensmith, the president and chief executive officer of Genco Shipping &amp; Trading Ltd., said that prices to move commodities -- which have already rallied sharply -- may follow.“You do get to a point, and you’ve seen this in containers, where you hit a certain utilization rate and you start to go parabolic on rates,” he said in an interview. “I think we’re getting close to that period.”&nbsp;Container rates have climbed because of snarled supply chains and extra trade that have strained the fleet’s capacity as economies emerge from the worst of Covid-19. The boom reached into every corner of the global economy because merchant fleet handles about 80% of the world’s traded goods.With more than 5 billion tons of dry commodities moved each year in so-called bulkers -- things like iron ore, coal, grains, steel and lumber -- a surge in dry freight would affect industries that produce and process everything from raw materials and crops.&nbsp;Rates for giant Capesize carriers had their biggest single-day surge since 2008 on Monday, reaching $52,908 a day. Wobensmith said demand is currently outpacing vessel supply, which will remain low for years with shipyard orders mostly led by container ships.&nbsp;Earnings remain well below the 2008 peak -- in excess of $200,000 a day just before the global recession hit -- and Wobensmith doesn’t anticipate them to get that high this time around. He also expects the situation to calm down again early next year.More,jmc,,10,0

7 months ago,Why $1.20+ div in Q3 is all but certain.Their Q2 TCE for the fleet was $23,000/day.The indications for Q3, so far, is that all their vessels classes are earning over $30,000/day.  There are some lags in the contracting, but an assumption of $30,000/day for the fleet average in Q3 is reasonable, if not conservative.The additional fleet averaged $7000/day is all free cash flow (positive EBITDA), since the Q2 rates already covered all costs and debt payments).With 128 vessels that increase in charter rates for Q3 equates to about $80M additional EBITDA.  They will continue their reserve build, of about $30M in Q3, so the additional free cash to shareholders would be 50M, or about 0.50/sh.  Atop the prior div of $0.70/sh, we should expect $1.20/sh in Q3 (assuming a fleet wide TCE of $30,000/day)More,martin,,11,1

7 months ago,Dreams really do come true (SBLK) - Deutsche BankOur positive view and conviction in the outlook for SBLK shares is based on thecompany’s fortress-like balance sheet, low all-in breakeven, and mgmt’s cashallocation strategy that distributes 100% of surplus cash flow (after debtrepayments) to shareholders in the form of dividends.Juxtaposition this with STNG (which we downgraded to Sell yesterday, here), thatis making dividend payments to equity holders despite not generating enough cashto meet debt repayment obligations (we note here: the largest shareholder of STNGreceiving dividend payments is the private, related party entity Scorpio HoldingsLimited).But we digress.We have said that SBLK’s strategy and framework can yield a sustainable $4 pershare in high-quality dividend payments annually on a mid-cycle basis, which webelieve would render the $20 share price as much too low ($40 is more appropriate,which is our price target, given that we view this as sustainable on a mid-cycle basisand not just a product of a very strong market....which rightfully won’t becapitalized).This investment thesis, while logical on paper and in theory, is not immune to therealities of the shipping business....where dreams can quickly turn to nightmaresbased on geopolitical dynamics and black swan events (which can be the normrather than the exception).With this as background, we are very pleased with SBLK’s 2Q results, where thecompany’s 70c dividend payout based on cash flow generated in 2Q, alone,surpassed even our own bullish expectations; and forward guidance implies evenhigher payout in 3Q and 4Q.Said another way, we have high confidence that SBLK will pay dividends of at least$3 per share for cash flow generated in 2020, which equates to a 15% div. yield oncurrent equity value. Equally notable, this number includes a relatively weak 1Q,when global trade was still impacted by COVID-19 lockdowns.The bottom line is yesterday evening release fully supports our positive stance onSBLK shares, and we expect shares to march much higher as market participantsbetter appreciate the cash flow and dividend dynamics over time.

7 months ago,there is little conviction in the dry bulk shipping stocks, and SBLK especially as the sector bell-weather.With BDI hitting records now daily, and share of SBLK are down almost 20% form where they traded earlier this summer.All the more puzzling since a 0.70/sh div payout is coming next week (double Q1 div), and all indictations are that the next quarter payout could double Q2, and be near $1.40/shThere continues to be muted new building activity.This must be the COVID concern that is affecting confidence.  And while the pace of industrial expansion worldwide may be slowed by the recent surge in COVID, its not cancelled.An investor accumulating shares at $20/sh today is likely to realize a 10% dividend payout ($2/sh) over the next 3.5 months- there is little risk against that occurring.Some are apparently fearful that the share price will be much more volatile (with a down bias) in that period, making the dividend insufficient reward against equity decline risk.Im probably trying too hard to rationalize ....More,martin,,5,1

I don't know it was Oaktree, but they've started to reduce their exposure to SBLK on the recent run-up, so it could have been them.While I'd prefer they not sell, I don't know if it's fair to view it as a bad sign or a lack of confidence.  They have held SBLK stock since 2014 and it's mostly been a terrible trade for them.  They aren't in the business of selling at the peak as much as manage their risk exposure to the name.  When the price goes up, they will take down some exposure (or the risk managers or the analyst on the trade (who was probably fired years ago will push to lower exposure)...so selling recently shouldn't be a surprise.More,jmc,,4,0
7 months ago,Stifel Issue the following this morning (BUY, $38)An eye opener is that IF 2022 spot rates were to average as in 2007 (the peak in the last cycle), they estimate a dividend payout of $14/sh! However, their assumptions for rates are more modest, and they project a 2022 payout of above $5/sh (w/o saying how far above...).Note also that they currently estimate NAV to be $23, and project that to rise with vessels values to $38._____Virtually all expenses in international commodity shipping are fixed but revenue (particularly for Star Bulk with the entire fleet in the spot market) can move dramatically. This lends itself to wild swings in earnings, cash flows, and, in the case of Star Bulk, dividends. Fundamentally, ship supply growth is definitively going to be very limited well into 2023 and even modest demand growth could cause a tight market and strong rates. We are expecting more than modest demand growth. On that basis, we are modeling strong rates (albeit a fraction of previous peak levels) which would imply 2022 dividends in excess of $5/share.  Key Points Earnings. Average rates earned by Starbulk in the quarter were about $1,500 lower than we had anticipated thanks to legacy contracts below $20,000/day signed late last year. However, the company did announce dividends of $0.70/share and authorize a $50 million share repurchase program. Going forward, the company has already booked 66% of 3Q days at $28,345 (vs $22,927 in 2Q) and with rates above $30,000/day currently, the numbers are only like to rise as most legacy contracts of rolled off. Also, for 4Q effectively the entire fleet is available in the spot market, just as we expect the combination of current market tightness, seasonally strong shipping demand, and continued port logistics constraints could cause the market to experience a sharp spike in rates. Dividends. Currently, the entire fleet of 128 vessels is available to trade in the spot market next year. We are modeling average rates for the fleet of just over $25,000/day for the year which would generate $777 million before debt repayment and dividends. We are modeling $250 million of debt repayment leaving more than $527 million available for dividends translating into just over $5/share of dividends. Importantly, every $1,000 change in day rate correlates to a $47 million change in cash flow available for distribution. In previous peak cycles, average dry bulk rates reach levels in excess of $60,000/day, averaging over $44,000 for the full year of 2007. While 2007 rates are certainly not what we are modeling, we do believe such levels may be possible and the implied dividends would be about $14/share. For the coming quarter, we are modeling $1.22/share on 3Q cash flows. The dividends could be even higher, but the company indicated a $25 million working capital build. Balance Sheet. The dividend program accounts for debt repayment. Therefore, we expect leverage to fall even as dividends rise. The company has a $150 million ATM equity raising program that has not been used, and will only be used to acquire additional assets if 1) they are accretive to EPS, 2) accretive to dividends/share, 3) reduce leverage, and 4) reduce fleet age. Consequently, the share price would likely have to be considerable higher in order to meet those criteria, and we do not expect activity until that time. Alternatively, the company could sell some of their older dry bulk ships and the equity generated could be used to buy back shares. Valuation. Price targets on cyclical stock with extreme operating leverage is tricky... Based on our spot rate assumptions for next year, we expect the company should generate $863 million of EBITDA and on 6x EV/EBITDA the implied price would be $38/share (our target). Currently, 15 NAV is just $23.13, but we estimate a 40% move in asset values (which is likely if rates are at the levels we are modeling) would cause NAV to rise to $38. Succinctly, if the market is strong which we expect it to be, shares likely move significantly higher. The magnitude is highly sensitive, but we would be buyers of the shares at these prices, and therefore, maintain our Buy rating.More,martin,,13,0

7 months ago,Worth listening to their conference call on Friday.First, they laid to rest concern about their ATM.  That share sale. would onlyoccur when SBLK share price is much higher - the cash raised wouldbe used for accretive acquisitions.Second, their $50M share repurchase does not occur at the expense of dividends.  The $50M could be raised, in part, via sale of older vessels, with the share repurchase again being accretive - it would building on the current arbitrage Between vessel prices and their share price.Third, their view is that their share price is disconnected with business fundamentals.  They will continue to work for the shareholders benefit, and are very optimistic.Fourth, their view is of a long term strong bulk shipping  market.  When their share price begins to reflect that (which they are confident in...), they will become more active in expanding the fleet - to the extent it is positive for cash flow, NAV, and dividend payout.Listening to the analysts, their number crunching points to a Q3 dividend in a range of $1.00 to $1.40/sh.  Management does not offer a dividend guidance.They still have a handful of Ultra and Pana to roll off earlier low contract rates, and that will have occurred by end of Q3 - indicating that their entire fleet is exposed to the current strong and strengthening spot market for most of the rest of 2021.They indicated that longer term contracts could be secured by SBLK  if Q4 rates become especially strong,  but they are intending to ride a surge in spot rates.More,martin,,12,0

I've been waiting for the bottom of the pullback in this sector to do this, and given that the 6-month chart has already started trending up, I think the bottom is behind us with a very high probability (and the share repurchase announcement has solidified this view), and so using calls at the very early stage of the new leg up is justified.More,DavidV,,5,0

8 months ago,As an example of share prices NOT following huge earnings and rise in vessel asset prices, look at such container shipping stocks as CMRE and CPLP.The container shipping rates have risen 400% in a year, the container ships of 10–yr now price higher than their newbuild equivalent. Yet, their share prices haven’t greatly moved in proportion.It might be that the large order book for container ships is causing folks to shy among from those stocks.And maybe that is what will differentiate dry bulk from containers.  But my hunch is that if dry bulk rates increase materially from here (already high historically), then ordering for new dry bulk vessels will follow. That too will eventually cap dry bulk equities.  The other distinction may be div payout from dry bulk companies, like SBLK, GOGL, and GNK.  If their earnings hold for the next 18 month period, the div payout will be 40-50% current market price - something not occurring among the container shippers.More,martin,,2,0

The current market has all the makings of a  super cycle (strong underlying commodity demand and pricing, limited near-term supply  growth, structural regulatory overhang limited ship ordering, etc).  ▪ All of our 2022 estimates are based on a better than average market but well below peak  cycle (2004-2008). Our price targets are based on ~6x the EBITDA generation generated at  those rates, but should the market move closer to previous peaks, EBITDAs could easily  triple.  ▪ Star Bulk Carriers (SBLK) – Largest name and also a primarily beneficiary from  scrubbers as fuel margins widen.

With those dynamics, we are adjusting our numbers modestly, continuing to favor dry bulk shipping names, keeping a close eye on tanker names, and we are somewhat mixed on container names. Our top idea of the 12 traditional shipping names under coverage is Star Bulk Carriers (SBLK).  Key Points • Dry Bulk: We are in the midst of a classic imbalance of supply &amp; demand with incremental ship supply limited by lower ordering activity over the past several years and demand for transportation being driven by strong infrastructure spending and commodity consumption. While the summer months are typically slower, we expect the current market to remain tight but not tighten further until late 3Q. However, with virtually no excess shipping supply and seasonal and structural increases coming with respect to the number of cargoes, we do expect there should be a sharp improvement in rates into the end of the year. Furthermore, the orderbook for 2022 is the smallest it has been in nearly 20 years, so only modest levels of demand growth could keep freight rates higher or tighten them further. Consequently, with plenty of gas last left in the tank, the dry bulk segment is our favorite area for 2H21 and 2022. Also, with very little ordering of dry bulk vessels still not taking place, we are increasing our 2023 estimates modestly as it looks as though the risk of eventual oversupply is being shifted further to the right. _______________More,martin,,4,0

8 months ago,Not much has changed in dry bulk the last 2 weeks, over which SBLK shares are off about 25%. Rates are strong.  BDI remains near 3000, an almost decade high. Little newbuild ordering, and lowest backlog on record.Bulk vessel values are climbing, and gradually clawing to levels that are moreConsistent with vessel earnings, Major players like are seeing the investment value in this sector, whether Fidelity large stake in dry bulk, to the new venture in dry bulk by shipping magnate Tor Olav, or that a major container shipper (CMRE) has elected to buy second hand bunkers for best growth opportunities in shipping - now having accumulated 28 Handy and Pana class ships. And, by all present indications, SBLK will pay a roughly 0.70/sh div for Q2, and likely larger payout in Q3.  Q4, if FFAs are any indication, would see yet a greater distribution.  So, sharing the wealth with shareholders was not a one-off in Q1, or a brief occurrence in 1H2021 - it is likeY to have appreciable legs. Some estimates indicate that 2021 and 2022 could see, combined, $8 - $10/sh payout.  In other words, 50-75% total return from the div alone.More,martin,,7,0

8 months ago,Robust commodity demand to spur dry bulk rally into Q3in Dry Bulk Market,International Shipping News 13/07/2021The surging demand for infrastructure-related commodities such as iron ore and coal, along with minor bulks such as aggregates, clinker, limestone is likely to help fuel the dry bulk market rally into the third quarter, with freight levels and time charter earnings setting new records.The dry bulk market has been on a firm footing since the beginning of 2021 and market participants expect the trend to continue in the upcoming quarter.“I expect the peak [for 2021] has not come yet as the [seasonally firmest quarter] is yet to come,” said a Capesize ship-owning source, adding that healthy demand for sub-Capesize sectors would support the Capesize rates, too.The Platts dual Cape T4 index averaged at $30,387/day and $33,615/day in Q2, basis lower sulfur marine fuel for non-scrubber vessels and scrubber-fitted tonnage separately and registered a record high of $44,233/day and $47,433/day on May 5.

8 months ago,Dry bulk ship values expected to rise considerably in 2H2021... despite strong share price action in last 9 months, considerably more ascent is expected ————-Home / Shipping News / Dry Bulk Market / No letup yet in dry bulk shipping’s ‘remarkable rally’No letup yet in dry bulk shipping’s ‘remarkable rally’in Dry Bulk Market,International Shipping News 12/07/2021Container shipping dominates the headlines, but in its shadow, dry bulk shipping is posting its best first half in a decade. Dry bulk, which is notorious for abruptly losing momentum, is still going strong.“This year’s remarkable rally is yet to run out of steam,” said Maritime Strategies International in its latest outlook.“The dry cargo market has taken many by surprise. The rally continues,” said Nick Ristic, lead dry cargo analyst at Braemar ACM Shipbroking.Rates for Capesize ships (bulkers with capacity of around 180,000 deadweight tons or DWT) rose to $33,300 per day on Monday, according to Clarksons Platou Securities. Panamaxes (65,000-90,000 DWT) were earning $32,800 per day and Supramaxes (45,000-60,000 DWT) $31,600 per day.It is extremely rare for all three size categories to simultaneously top $30,000, as they have for the past two weeks. Panamax and Supramax rates are now at fresh highs for the year. Panamax rates are more than double their five-year average and Supramax rates are more than triple theirs.Positive signalsForward freight agreement (FFA) pricing, time-charter rates and ship valuations all point to continued strength.FFAs traded down on Monday but remain above current spot rates for the coming quarter. According to brokerage BRS, the Capesize Q3 contract closed at $39,958 per day and the Q4 at $36,257, the Panamax Q3 at $35,800 and Q4 at $30,004, and the Supramax Q3 at $34,928 and Q4 at $29,692.On the time-charter front, Clarksons reported that “activity remains robust, with several fixtures in the 6- to 12-month range across the various asset classes reported recently. Currently, 12-month charters are quoted at above $30,000 per day for Capes, $27,000 per day for Panamaxes and $24,000 per day for Supramaxes.“Several Capes hovering around the 15-year-age range have been fixed on 12-month charters at above $30,000 per day recently,” said Clarksons. “This equates to an EBITDA [earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization] of $9 million as compared to valuation quotes of $20.5 million for such vessels — and scrap value close to $12 million — indicating much more upside remains in secondhand values.”Secondhand ship prices have already risen sharply. According to Braemar ACM, the price of a 5-year-old Capesize has increased 25% since December, with the price of a 10-year Cape jumping 50%. The price of a 5-year-old Supramax has risen 23%, a 10-year-old Supramax 42%.During the Marine Money Week virtual conference last week, Aristides Pittas, CEO of EuroDry (NASDAQ: EDRY), opined, “Dry bulk [ship] prices have increased quite a lot, but they still have significant room to move upwards if the market follows anything like what we saw during the last good cycle in 2005-2007.” He predicted that ship values will rise further 20%-25% by year-end.Martyn Wade, CEO of Grindrod Shipping (NASDAQ: GRIN), was even more bullish. He maintained that bulker values still have an additional 50%-75% to run. “With the cash being generated, five-year values are just too cheap at the moment,” Wade asserted.Triple-digit gains for stocksDry bulk equities are largely a play on rebounding industrial production, infrastructure construction and the strength of the Chinese economy. U.S.-listed dry bulk stocks began their ascent in November. Even after a pullback on Monday, dry bulk stocks were up triple digits over the past eight months.Between Nov. 2 and Monday, the stock price of EuroDry rose 614%, Safe Bulkers (NYSE: SB) 364%, Star Bulk (NYSE: SBLK) 282%, Eagle Bulk (NASDAQ: EGLE) 248%, Golden Ocean (NASDAQ: GOGL) 211%, Grindrod 190% and Genco Shipping &amp; Trading (NYSE: GNK) 180%.The Breakwave Dry Bulk Shipping ETF (NYSE: BDRY) — an exchange-traded fund launched in March 2018 that buys FFAs — is up 344% since November. Volumes have surged over the past three months. The ETF closed at the highest level in its history on Friday.How long can rally last?Pittas believes there will be “exceptionally strong demand” for iron ore and coal, together with “very promising demand” for grains and other minor dry bulks. “We have the possibility of two or three good years in dry bulk ahead of us,” he argued.Jefferies analyst Randy Giveans highlighted the all-time-low newbuilding orderbook, at just 5.8% of on-the-water tonnage. “We believe a perfect storm of underlying supply and demand fundamentals is shaping up in the dry bulk segment, which could boost charter rates and asset values in the coming years,” Giveans saidMore,martin,,3,0

SBLK has about 50 such vessels in their fleet.Cape rates have been week of late, and that class has been the sole drag on the BDI.  The weakness in SBLK stock price seems unjustified by near record level earnings for 70% of their fleet, and very strong ($29,000/day) spot rates on Capes.Right now, spot rates averaged for their fleet overall is above $30,000/day.Note that their fleet avg Q1 2021 TCE was about $15,000/day, and their existing fixtures at that time for Q2 suggested TCEs about $21,000/day. It is likely that Q3 2021 TCEs will be in the $25,000/day range.And, if FFAs for 2H2021 are close, then Cape rates should rise about $50,000/day by Fall.More,martin,,7,0

9 months ago,Based on the strength of rates closing Q2 2021, and looking through their May q1 presentation, it seems likely that their Q2 div will be a bit more than done Q1 - in the range 0.60 - 0.70/sh.  That is based on a rough estimate of fleet TCE of near $21,000/day (compared to $15K/day in Q1).The spot rates for Capes are now back to $34,000/day, but those are only marginally higher than day ratesfor Supras, Handys and Panamax.The expectation by some is that Cape/Newcastle spot will see much high rates in Q3/Q4.  Right now, this is not a Cape-led bulk market.  if it becomes so, and capes rise to $75,000/day (typically double Pana rates), then it is possible to see SBLK fleet average TCE by Q4 50% to 100% their Q2 fleet average.   In other words, Q4 EBITDA would be $100M -$200M greater than Q2 (Q2 EBITDA looks to be around $140M).  That would allow Q4 dividend to be $1 to $2/sh above Q2.I other words, the Jefferies analyst Randy Givens recent view that SBLK would pay about $4.50/sh in dividends in 2021 is quite plausible.Stifel's Ben Nolan has 2021 dividend of near $6/sh.If these two brokerages are correct, then we are looking at a $20 stock paying $10 in dividends over the next 18 months.   That's a 50% yield!!Either the dividend isn't going to be close to that, or their share price wont stay close to its current level.My hunch is the latter...More,martin,,4,1

Once the price gets closer to $1.30 (what is very likely today) shorts will panic cover pushing the price even higher. This is the feedback loop the longs need. It will happen like this for a number of days and this is what will take us to $2.25 region where there might be a little of consolidation and after that towards the date of Q2 results we might see the price to go parabolic to $3.40. Q2 results and the guidance the company will be the catalyst for the capitulation of shorts and we may see an epic short squeeze. In many cases shipping companies use those short squeezes to rise more capital and dilute. If you listen carefully the Q1 earnings call the CEO said there will be no dilution until at least Q4. If they dilute before the CEO will be in the violation of the Securities Act and I don’t think he would do it. There are plenty of law firms specializing in securities laws that would immediately jump on the idea of making money on such an easy case. This is a very good time for us fellow shipping magnates. This in no advice. I am just a trader and shared with you my view on SHIP. If you click on my name you will see I am trading SHIP long only since when it was $0.80 last year. I invested in SHIP because I saw they have the business model that benefits a lot from current high shipping rates and they added 45% more vessels since Q1, while at the same time reduced their debt. They must be making a lot of money now and there is a great probability the company will pay dividend out of 2021 profits. This is a true turnaround story. The expenses the company are in line with the industry standards so there is no way the management is circumventing any money (what shorts falsly claim). Actually the expenses in relation to revenue are smaller than $DSX which is at least twice as big as SHIP (in terms of revenue and DWT)One more thing.

Demand growth is expected to outpace increased supply in 2022. Rates should remain well above 2020 levels even as they come off their May highs. (06/02/21)5. Full Steam Ahead for Recovery of Dry BulkCapesize RatesSource: Bloomberg IntelligenceDataChartDry bulk may gradually improve with a tonnage rebound this year, according to our main recovery scenario, in-line with Clarksons estimates for tonne miles to rise 3.9% in 2021 following last year's anemic 0.5% gain. We believe the increased tonnage, combined with easier comparisons, should support higher rates. Chinese iron-ore imports will drive demand trends into 2022, since they account for about 20% of the global dry-bulk market. Total iron-ore demand is expected to increase by low-single digits this year. Iron ore is predominantly moved in Capesize vessels, which are trading at over 10-year highs. Capesize rates have surged 110x since their May 2020 lows and are up 10x on average this year.Companies Impacted: NYK, Pan Ocean, China Cosco, Diana Shipping, Star Bulk and Golden Ocean are among the largest owners of Capesize ships.

10 months ago,Another double from here? We think so - Deutsche Bank research, May 18th: BUYSBLK is the largest shipper of dry bulk commodities, and shares have been on firein recent months. SBLK’s equity value today stands nicely above $2B, and equityvalue per share is up +150% ytd, and +30% over the last one month...far outpacinggains in the broader market. Some of this reflects the outlook for internationalshipping companies as the world’s economies emerge from lock-downs, but thereare also notable company-specific drivers that explain the rally, and point to muchmore to come, in our view. To be sure, even despite the above-mentionedoutperformance, SBLK remains at the very top of our Shipping coverage list, and westill see potential for plenty more upside.The next leg of upside, we believe, will come tomorrow after the close, when weexpect SBLK mgmt. to announce the start of a sizeable and sustainable dividend.We note, for example, that in late 2019, SBLK issued a dividend policy stating thatit would need to reach a minimum cash balance per vessel of $2.1M by 3Q’21 before100% of excess cash beyond this level will accrue to dividends. This translates to atotal cash balance of $265M on a full delivered basis...and we believe SBLK willhave reached this threshold pro forma for 1Q results, implying 100% of surplus cashflow will move to equity holders in the form of dividends in 2Q and beyond. And wenote SBLK’s very low breakeven of about $11,000 per day (which includes debtamortization) should result in meaningful cash build, which – based on thecompany’s dividend policy – should drive notable payouts.As an example, Capesize rates YTD are about $18,000 per day (and about $30kcurrently). Assuming $24,000 average TCE rate for the entire year (which we thinkis reasonable, with SBLK disclosing on its 4Q call that 50% of its 1Q Capesize dayshave been booked at $19,000 per day, and rates have increased notably since then),this would imply about $13,000 per day of surplus cash flow, or ~$585M in surpluscash flow available for dividends (or about $5.85 per share, which equates to a yieldof over 25%). And importantly, this payment would reflect true return on capital(rather than return of capital) while still giving the company ample liquidity cushionvia the above-mentioned per vessel cash threshold. This is particularly attractivegiven SBLK’s very low break-even levels (largely due to lower leverage)...and wouldallow for notable dividend payments in just about all except the most draconianenvironments. This level of payout is why we believe shares still have plenty ofupside left.The bottom line is that the opportunity for upside in SBLK shares that we have longbelieved in is now well on its way to being achieved– with plenty more upsidepotential, if the company’s dividend payments evolve as we expect in the comingweeks and quarters. As such, we are raising our price target to $40 (from $22), aswe move to a dividend valuation framework given what we expect to be announcedtomorrow after the close, and our view of the sustainability of this new dividendmodel. The new target is based on a 15% div yield, which we think is veryconservative, but nonetheless prudent, with plenty of upside beyond this oncemarket participants believe in sustainability of the company's strong payout.Importantly, we believe this will allow SBLK’s equity value to de-couple from NAV,which should allow for accelerated de-leveraging, which further drives higherdividends. Maintain Buy and Top Shipping Pick; Risks include weaker dry bulk spotrates and lower asset values./More,c,,8,0

But the FFA curve, if it were to come to pass would imply what you're talking about.More,c,,0,0
10 months ago,Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank QuestionsThanks operator. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk about the bookings in the second quarter and how that will translate to the cash balance. And then, obviously, the dividend, I think we can quite easily calculate the cash flow based on the TCE rate relative to the $11,000 breakeven but what this didn't -- important to understand at least for me is all the other cash calls. I guess, there's some outlays on the dry docking that you mentioned in the slide deck maybe $10 million, $11 million. But I wonder if there's also some working capital drag given the big spike in rates during the quarter -- second quarter. If you can just talk about that and what you can say if anything about the dividend in the second quarter based on your formula and that you have over 80% of the days already booked.Hamish NortonWell, I guess, we're not in the business of guiding on earnings or the dividend that would be the job of each analyst. But, I guess, Christos do you want to talk about working capital?Christos BeglerisSure. In the rising markets like today's market dynamics, working capital increases because the freight receivables that you expect from voyages that you book at higher rates are increasing. We, therefore, expect to have a drag on the actual rates that we're recording in a specific quarter versus the Baltic Index that you monitor basically on a daily basis.Therefore, we wouldn't expect to see the exact index, but there would be a lag in an increasing market as there is also an overperformance in a decreasing market when you're actually getting freight rates from -- higher freight rates from orders we have booked in the past. And, therefore, we're making higher rates than the BDI. Yes. And the working capital is typically about 25 day -- our receivables basically are typically averaging about 25 days. So, as freights go up, we've got basically 25 days of revenue in working capital.Amit MehrotraBut I guess that the fact of the matter is though, your average rates for the second quarter so far 80-plus percent booked is 40% above what it was in the first quarter. So, I think is it safe to assume that there's a significant increase in dividend in 2Q versus Q1 given that higher earnings power or working cap?Hamish NortonWell let's say, we wouldn't be surprised to see Q2 do better than Q1. Yes. I mean you're not wrong.More,c,,3,0

Would think that 2Q dividend should be somewhere in the $0.50 - $0.75 range which put you at a 10-15% dividend yield on the current share price if the dividends are sustained at that level.That doesn't incorporate any upside to the dividend as the company reduces debt, hits their cash per vessel target, or sees even higher rates if the global economy booms as expected.,jmc,,0,1

Iron ore imports topped 100 million tons for the first time since October, although subsequent months may show the impact of Beijing’s curbs on steel output to control emissions.Steel product exports hit a four-year high as the world economy rebounded, and as traders reacted to rumors of an impending cut in&nbsp;export rebates&nbsp;-- which is yet to be confirmed.Crude imports of nearly 50 million tons were stronger than expected and the highest total since July, despite scheduled maintenance at refineries. Additional cargoes of U.S.-sanctioned&nbsp;Iranian oil&nbsp;bought by independent refiners may have been behind the increase.Among other energy goods, coal imports performed better than expected, recording their highest total this year, despite the ban on Australian shipments. Gas imports slipped back as the market headed into a low season for demand.Imports of agricultural goods maintained a fast pace to cover China’s domestic shortfalls and feed the recovery in its hog herd, with corn purchases rising over 400% to 6.7 million tons in the first quarter.The farm ministry last week bowed to reality by&nbsp;more than doubling&nbsp;its expectations for imports of the grain in 2020-2021 to 22 million tons -- a figure more in step with, if at the low end, of other forecasts. Meat imports in March, meanwhile, rose above 1 million tons for the first time.The&nbsp;broader trade data&nbsp;showed that China’s exports rose less than expected in March, even as global demand continued to strengthen, while imports grew at a faster pace.More,c,,3,0
11 months ago,Who do you think is going to haul all the commodities needed for all the infrastructure being built not only in the US, but around the world?  Dry bulk shippers.  And now, with all the berths sold out in the big shipyards that can build vessels over 100,000 dwt, most taken by containerships, there can't be any new Capes added to the fleet.  Rates should see a big spike this year and average better than any in the last ten.,d,,1,0
last year,Todays SBLK beating seems unwarranted if you read this from Deutsche Bank last week:Drybulk CarrierCapesize and Supramax rates were up 16% and 19% w/w, averaging $14k and $19k per  day,  while  Kamsarmax  rates  were  flat,  averaging  $23k  per  day.  We  note  Capesize rates have largely increased on higher rates on the Australian routes while the Brazil-China route remains challenged. Capesize rates have been bolstered by China’s steel production, which is up 13% YTD. Freight-forward agreements for Capesize bulkers improved to $18k per day in March and $23k per day in July, significantly above current spot rates. Timecharter market rates were the following: $17,750 for Capesize, $17,375 for Kamsarmax and $14,875 for Supramax.More,c,,3,0

last year,Little dip in rates today.  Chinese talking down the ore market.  " The Baltic dry index, which tracks rates for capesize, panamax and supramax vessels, fell 48 points, or 2.1%, to 2,271.* The capesize index declined 77 points, or 3.2%, to 2,305.* Average daily earnings for capesizes, which typically transport 150,000-tonne cargoes such as coal and steel-making ingredient iron ore, fell $637 to $19,114.* Dalian coke futures slumped for a third consecutive session on Tuesday, weighed down by weak demand for the steelmaking raw material in China and as steel mills lowered their buying prices citing ample stocks.* The panamax index was down 75 points, or 2.5%, to 2,983, snapping a seven-session rally.* Average daily earnings for panamaxes, which usually carry coal or grain cargoes of about 60,000 tonnes to 70,00 tonnes, fell $674 to $26,846.* The supramax index fell 7 points to 2,126."More,d,,1,0
