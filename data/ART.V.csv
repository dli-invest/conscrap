7 months ago,Reason for today's excitement - copied from ceo.caNational Inflation Association (NIA) is excited to announce its #1 technology pick for 2022: ARHT Media (TSXV: ART) or ARHTF on the U.S. OTC. ART is currently trading for $0.185 per share with 133 million shares outstanding for a market cap of $24.6 million (US$19.93 million). ART has developed patented Augmented Reality Holographic Telepresence technology.  Facebook (FB) announced yesterday that it is changing it name to Meta and investing $10 billion per year to develop a metaverse platform. If you listened to Mark Zuckerberg's presentation, he repeatedly discussed the important role of holograms. According to Zuckerberg, "Lots of things that are physical today like screens will just be able to be holograms in the future!" Zuckerberg said, "You won't need a physical tv it'll just be a one dollar hologram from some high school kid halfway across the world!" Zuckerberg went onto say, "You'll be able to take your items and project them into the physical world as holograms!" Zuckerberg later said, "I'm genuinely optimistic about work in the metaverse. We know from the last couple of years that a lot of people can effectively work from anywhere but hybrid is going to be a lot more complex when some people are together and others are still remote. Giving everyone the tools to be present no matter where they are whether it's a hologram sitting next to you in a physical meeting or in a discussion taking place in the metaverse, that's going to be a game changer!"  ART has developed the world's most advanced hologram technology! ART has established itself as the global leader in holograms! It would make a lot of sense for Meta to eventually acquire ART! We predict ART will become the #1 biggest Metaverse play in the entire market!  Past performance is not an indicator of future returns.

Furthermore, an existing UK-based multinational pharmaceutical client leveraged the Company's technology to beam in professors from Singapore to Panama and France as part of its recurring medical education speaker series.”  all this won’t move ARHT price won’t even help next Q results cause expenses outstripping income a cash crunch but once I buy ARHT @ 0.18/0.19 then and only then will this move upMore,🥨 🍻,,0,6

8 months ago,@Graham what's your problem? Please sell and move on, or stop crying and start contributing some valuable information. Let me tell you something, Arht is my only stock that didn’t give me any returns yet, and I’ve been here for a year. My average is $0.25 Cad (after a few buys to average down), which means I’m currently down, but I’m not whining like you. If I stop believing in Arht, I’ll just sell and leave, but honestly, I’m thinking of buying more if it goes down more because I still believe that there is potential here. I closely follow what they are doing and how they are progressing and they are doing perfectly well, in my opinion, much better than last year, but for some reason, that is not reflected in the share price.I don't have a problem with you, but you obviously have a problem with me because you often call my name here for no reason. I would like to hear at least some opinion about Arht from you, as you can hear from me, but you have no opinion, you are just provoking, so relax, enjoy life and go invest somewhere else because Arht is obviously not good for your mental health.More,Jayde Jk,,10,1

Will need revenue growth over the next couple years before we truly see how this plays out. Risk reward ratio is promising and I am long. Nothing will happen short term that creates strong wealth.

last year,Earnings filing deadline:We all wonder about earnings and when they will release them so we can see their progress.  Since Arht media is listed on the Venture stock exchange, their deadline is April 30. Last year there was an extension of the application deadline due to Covid, but I think that is no longer applicable because I could not find the updated information. Here is the time frame for this year:Period Ending………………………..Reporting Deadline Dec. 31, 2020………………………...Apr. 30, 2021Mar. 31, 2021………………………..May 31, 2021Jun. 30, 2021…………………………Aug. 30, 2021Sep. 30, 2021………………………..Nov. 29, 2021Based on the deadline, we should see Q4 2020 released this month (most likely towards the end of the month) and Q1 2021 next month, so we will have the opportunity to track their progress in two earnings reports filed just a month apart….More,Jayde Jk,,6,0

last year,Nice read. Another article on ARHT published todayHow AR/VR Can Elevate Learning Experiences"At the core of ARHT Media’s technology is the ARHT Engine, software that enables high-quality, low-latency AV streaming with end-to-end encryption. HoloPresence is a 3D display that doesn’t require viewers to wear 3D glasses, and which allows remote lecturers to appear in front of audiences as live holograms. Released in November 2020, HoloPod is a more portable version of HoloPresence (which does require an hour and a half to deploy). Designed for lecture halls, corporate training centers, and large corporate boardrooms, HoloPod is a plug-and-play cabinet on wheels that can be fully secured when not in use. Virtual Global Stage (VGS), the ARHT Media’s online, low-latency presentation platform, rounds out the company’s current lineup. ARHT Media CEO Larry O’Reilly explained that in using these solutions, universities become truly borderless. “What it allows higher education institutions to do is bring in core curriculum instructors or guest lecturers from anywhere in the world and have them present live or pre-recorded, lifelike, life-size, and fully interactive,” he said."https://www.avnetwork.com/features/how-arvr-can-elevate-learning-experiencesMore,Jayde Jk,,10,0

last year,Dear Arht Media, Your behavior on Monday was very strange, don’t get me wrong, I liked it very much, and I trust all your investors, but I wonder what is happening now, why did you stop, why are you coming back down? I like you and I like your technology. You showed us that you can move up and move very fast, and it’s kind of hard to watch you fall again now. I still believe in you and I know that one day you will be big, but now I’m asking you to continue to grow, do not stop and do not look back, it’s time for you to take steps. I’m not asking you to jump to $10 right away (although I wouldn’t mind), but just show me the steady and healthy growth. Sincerely, Your InvestorMore,Jayde Jk,,15,0

I personally just needed something to say all is good and moving in the right direction for the company . Good morning Larry, The ARHT investor world is very discouraged right now as there has been no communication over the last month or so. Also, many times in the past it seems like investors are having to dig and find out AHRT events and happenings after the fact without them even being communicated or to find out at a much later date. Can you please give us a little hope/insight moving forward into 2021 as I know many of us need it right now . Thank you, Larry. Good morning Kevin, I am sorry people are discouraged, there is good news on the way. To clarify, between Nov 10 and Dec 18 we put out 6 press releases announcing new partners, high profile activations, permanent installs with recurring revenue and the first installation of the HoloPod at the #1 Rehabilitation Research Hospital in the world. On Nov 10 the stock opened at 0.305 and on Dec 18 the stock closed at 0.27. There was no news through Dec 31 and the stock closed at 0.30. There seems to be little correlation between news and stock performance. However, much of the world came back to work this week (we came back last week) and we will have news to share in January and beyond. Thanks for the feedback. Larry"More,Jayde Jk,,4,0

ARHT Media is hiring which is a very good sign that their business is going in the right direction. This is what ARHT’s director of technology, B.J. Hjelholt, posted on LinkedIn (I’m unable to post a link to his comment but I can copy it): “ARHT Media has plans to grow significantly in 2021! In anticipation we're looking for talented Virtual/Hybrid Event, Broadcast, Product, Purchasing/Procurement experts that can join or support our team. Most should be based near our HQ in Toronto but there will be opportunities globally as well. If you've got experience in any of these areas we want to hear from you!

last year,@Massimo, you’re correct. And for everyone else who doubts, here is my view &amp; why I invested. When I invested in this company several months ago, the company wasn’t profitable but I did my DD, read a lot about the company and liked their technology and what they do to make it profitable, so I invested in future growth. At the investor meeting, I believe, in August, Larry said they expect to become profitable by the end of this year and as early as September, and he was right, they had good Q3 results. Since then, they have done a great job and are rapidly expanding their customer base. Some of you know, and some may not, they have some big clients, but they have NDAs with them and for that reason they are not allowed to disclose or market some events in which their technology is used. You have to be patient with this company, they are on the right track, and if not earlier, I believe the price will start to rise after Q4, which I expect will be very good, it should be sometime in January. I agree that they should be more involved in marketing, but remember that just one event with proper exposure would make it fly.... I had the opportunity to sell it several times with a profit but I didn’t and I’m not selling because I believe in the company and I believe in their potential. It’s now sitting at my average &amp; even had some drops below my average but I’m thinking of buying more….This is my reason why I’m invested but if you are in doubt &amp; don’t believe in the company, just move to something else at the first opportunity….More,Jayde Jk,,7,0

2 years ago,Almo is presenting ARHT in today's webinar. Here is another interesting article published on Oct. 20 about their partnership and ARHT's technology:“New Technology Sets a Higher Standard for the Virtual Experience Almo Professional A/V and ARHT Media, Inc. have an exciting new partnership and offering that could transform the landscape for digital meetings, events and hybrid/virtual learning. This new solution, in fact, could enhance almost any application in which a face-to-face interaction or presentation, prior to COVID-19, would have been the norm. The technology, developed by ARHT, is called Holographic TelePresence, and Almo is now the exclusive U.S. distributor for it. Through this solution, we can deliver a unique and highly engaging holographic display experience like never before.ARHT Media is the global leader in the development, production and transmission of high-quality, low latency hologram and digital content. Using proprietary technology, capture studios and standard projection equipment, Holographic TelePresence “beams” presenters into one or multiple venues simultaneously. You may also hear the technology referred to as HoloPresence, short for “holographic presence.” Presenters can be located anywhere in the world — they just need the equipment and access to the platform via the web. Along with a new hologram presentation platform known as the Virtual Global Stage, Holographic TelePresence enables hybrid events — with some participants attending remotely and some attending live.This solution completely amplifies virtual interactions, online presentations, and hologram services in a way that your customer has never seen. With it, organizations, advertisers, and event marketers can reach a proportionately larger audience and deliver a premium hologram presentation that goes well beyond the 2D video call. Meanwhile, presenters benefit by being able to use key aspects of natural communication, like body language, to deliver a more engaging message and experience to attendees.Even though we all miss that in-person interaction, it is no longer the only way we do business. The mass deployment of video conferencing solutions in early 2020 was a big step forward for AV — but video chat and 2D video conference software only scratches the surface of what’s possible. Holographic TelePresence brings prime-time to all of us and completely enhances the way we interact virtually.Read more about ARHT Media’s new Holographic TelePresence technology through Almo’s three-part blog series."https://www.commercialintegrator.com/communications/new-technology-sets-a-higher-standard-for-the-virtual-experience/More,Jayde Jk,,6,0

2 years ago,Another article about Arht and Almo PartnershipVirtual Presence BY SVC STAFF PUBLISHED: OCTOBER 13, 2020According to Sam Taylor, “COVID-19 has taught us that even though we all miss that in-person interaction, it is no longer the only way to do business – and it has, in fact, given our industry the opportunity to tap into new technologies that increase the quality of the virtual experience and augment live events while improving productivity throughout the day.” He continued, “We have partnered with ARHT Media to bring this technology to our partners, specifically those focused on rental and staging as we know that ‘live events’ is currently one of the hardest-hit segments in the market. The technology is ready for prime-time and is poised to truly enhance the way we interact, both now and into the future.”Virtual Global Stage is a premium digital on-stage experience online that eliminates the need for a venue, travel or the gathering of presenters and attendees. With ARHT Media’s patented multi-point broadcast solution, multiple 3D presenters in lifesized proportions can be brought to a virtual stage, side-by-side as if all parties were physically next to each other while actually being in completely different locations around the globe. With Virtual Global Stage, panel discussions, fireside chats, training events, town halls, product launches and more can all be executed in a virtual environment like never before.https://www.svconline.com/industry/virtual-presenceMore,Sammy,,3,0

In these times of social distancing, ART has developed a method to make programs like award shows go off like the large-scale spectacles that they are intended to be. ART announced recently that it had partnered with The Green Carpet Fashion Awards to help amplify the online awards show experience with holograms of celebrity presenters for their first-ever virtual awards ceremony that will be broadcasted globally.ART followed this up with news that it had captured The Mind Architect Peter Crone in ARHT’s LA studio and presented him holographically for a live fireside talk with Juniper Park\TBWA CEO Jill Nykoliation at Hotel X in front of a physically distanced select audience of the YPO Maple Leaf chapter (Young Presidents’ Organization)."https://stockhouse.com/opinion/buzz-on-the-bullboards/2020/10/15/buzz-on-bullboards-who-s-who-business-covidMore,Jayde Jk,,4,0

2 years ago,Interesting read published today – Viewpoint: Sammy Andrews on the future for live music She shares her views on how the pandemic has advanced the use and reliance upon technology. She mentioned various events, but also said: "One is the forthcoming Green Carpet Fashion Awards on October 10. This truly pioneering show will combine cinematic footage with a fusion of augmented reality and visual FX, created using real-time game engines, and will have talent appearing as holograms. The companies behind this are no strangers to the music industry. Veteran show producer Kim Chappell has brought together an incredible team including UK music industry leaders NorthHouse for show design, visual FX and graphics and ARHT Media for holograms, a company I know many of you are familiar with for legacy touring."https://www.musicweek.com/opinion/read/viewpoint-sammy-andrews-on-the-future-for-live-music/081346More,Jayde Jk,,3,0

2 years ago,Bought this at 17 cents. Rode the entire wave up to 250% gains and now back on the downswing. Initially I was frustrated as the price dropped, but the cheaper it gets, the more likely they will be bought out by Nextech. This technology enhances the future of AR conferences, tradeshows, etc so well and everybody knows there are some discussions going on between the 2 companies which have close ties through Paul Duffy. Nextech wants at least 1 or 2 aquisitions in the next 6 months. Hang tight my friends...it is a win-win regardless of the current price movement!,Curdy,,0,0

2 years ago,Why not announce some profit generating deals as they come along. The problem with any company is that they have to generate enough income to pay all the salaries for the company employees and have some left over for growth. If not, they have to burn their cash savings or keep generating new capital by selling shares or getting loans. Not sure what the situation is with this company but I have a feeling they are not generating nearly enough to pay for all the employees and expenses. That's the bottom line. No matter how good of a product they have if they cannot generate cash to pay the salary it's over. That's where marketing and sales can make or break a company. Hope they make it but it's going to take a lot of deals for this to be profitable company.More,TM4G,,3,0

2 years ago,ARHT Media Announces Strategic Partnership With TLC Creative Special Effects The First Client to Purchase New ARHT Engines With Transmission Bundles10:00 am ET July 23, 2020 (Globe Newswire) ARHT Media Inc. ("ARHT" or "the Company") (TSXV:ART), is the global leader in the development, production and distribution of high-quality, low latency hologram and digital content. ARHT is pleased to announce that it is has entered into a Strategic Partnership with Los Angeles based special effects powerhouse TLC Creative to utilize ARHT Engine software, combined with the Company's recently launched Transmission Bundles, to deliver both online and in-person holopresence experiences.TLC is the official special effects supplier to the Los Angeles Lakers and has delivered audio visual experiences at the Super Bowl, the Olympics, television shows such as Dancing with the Stars and American Idol as well as with international recording artists including Lady Gaga, Usher, Jennifer Lopez, Miley Cyrus, and many others.A photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/841dea73-f493-48d0-8726-f797af1e2db7"When I first experienced ARHT's live two-way holopresence tech earlier this year in Seattle, I knew that I had to offer this technology to our very long list of both domestic and international clients," stated TLC CEO and Founder Kevin Bilida. "With so many events now being delivered online, ARHT's Virtual Global Stage is the perfect solution that will enhance the online experience, which we will showcase at a major event in September."TLC is also bringing the unique experience of seeing live special effects to virtual events. Bursts of sparks close to business presenters is a true surprise, creating excitement and real energy. Live confetti, laser aerials, and other live special effects, are adding impact to live streamed events in ways that can't be duplicated any other way."We are proud to be working with Kevin and the TLC team as they have introduced so many new technological innovations in special effects over the years and now, they are innovating online with us," commented ARHT CEO Larry O'Reilly. "By offering our ARHT Engine server and software technology combined with the cost savings of our Transmission Bundles it made the decision for TLC to promote our tech that much easier, while allowing us to focus on our highest margin products. It's a true win-win scenario, which will generate recurring revenues."More,Jackie Dodson,,4,4

I think of hologram as screenless projeciton of 3D image but I don't think that's the case here. Regardless, if the person looks like 3D then I suppose the end result is the same.

2 years ago,The good thing about this stock is that there’s enough optimism and volume to keep it moving and pushing forward and as long as people take profit along the way this creates little dips keeping it interesting, the worst is when everyone holds out and then all at once everyone cashes in creating a panic sell off  and bag holders.Bag holders aren’t going to reinvest and then everything slows down to a crawl , it’s healthy and smart to take profit along the way and then just reinvest and do it all over again.,james,,0,0

I understand there was an RS and now its time to recover and more as this train ain't staying still. The appetite for AR is a game changer for this stock now. I'm in for the long haul, full steam ahead!!,MJL,,0,0

2 years ago,With working from home requirements, AR is getting more traction for videoconferences and seminars. In our company they've traded Webex for Government Zoom but they haven't found a contender for townhall meetings. It is a new reality for the communication and conference industry. I can easily see companies using this technology for seminars, employee assistance programs and more. There is so much potential and opportunities for this stock. I'm in for the long haul!!,MJL,,7,0

2 years ago,this companys platform is utterly amazing. I love the hologram quality and the fact that they can source multiple people as 3d AR holographic assets from anywhere in the world and put them together as holograms in their custom AR Global stages. the Global stage concept is already gaining fruition and I can only imagine this along with a few others $IP and $NTAR paving the way for AR in 2020 and beyond, these types of technology are what apple, google , microsoft, snapchatz facebook, all WANT and NEED. this space will be growing weekly as the year progresses. AR is the new tech of the post covid world. this includes 3D assets(holograms), geolocating and geoplanting said 3D assets, virtual conferences with AR, and the marketting industry with advertisable 3D assets instead of 2d images for advertising. Folks this is the future of business. Augmented Reality.More,Anthony,,0,0
