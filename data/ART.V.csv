4 hours ago,well im out of the rest of mine, it s said that with a promoter they cant hold 10 cent gain, to me that means lower shares but i may be wrong. with everyone starting to come back to work there is less and less need for this technology. one day it will peak but i think were years away ( just my opinion,Huey,,1,0

yesterday,Nice read. Another article on ARHT published todayHow AR/VR Can Elevate Learning Experiences"At the core of ARHT Media‚Äôs technology is the ARHT Engine, software that enables high-quality, low-latency AV streaming with end-to-end encryption. HoloPresence is a 3D display that doesn‚Äôt require viewers to wear 3D glasses, and which allows remote lecturers to appear in front of audiences as live holograms. Released in November 2020, HoloPod is a more portable version of HoloPresence (which does require an hour and a half to deploy). Designed for lecture halls, corporate training centers, and large corporate boardrooms, HoloPod is a plug-and-play cabinet on wheels that can be fully secured when not in use. Virtual Global Stage (VGS), the ARHT Media‚Äôs online, low-latency presentation platform, rounds out the company‚Äôs current lineup. ARHT Media CEO Larry O‚ÄôReilly explained that in using these solutions, universities become truly borderless. ‚ÄúWhat it allows higher education institutions to do is bring in core curriculum instructors or guest lecturers from anywhere in the world and have them present live or pre-recorded, lifelike, life-size, and fully interactive,‚Äù he said."https://www.avnetwork.com/features/how-arvr-can-elevate-learning-experiencesMore,JK,,8,0

13 days ago,Dear Arht Media, Your behavior on Monday was very strange, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I liked it very much, and I trust all your investors, but I wonder what is happening now, why did you stop, why are you coming back down? I like you and I like your technology. You showed us that you can move up and move very fast, and it‚Äôs kind of hard to watch you fall again now. I still believe in you and I know that one day you will be big, but now I‚Äôm asking you to continue to grow, do not stop and do not look back, it‚Äôs time for you to take steps. I‚Äôm not asking you to jump to $10 right away (although I wouldn‚Äôt mind), but just show me the steady and healthy growth. Sincerely, Your InvestorMore,JK,,14,0

2 months ago,I copied this post from the Stockhouse board: "Hey Everyone. Kevin wrote this to Larry this morning and here was his response . This makes me feel better . I personally just needed something to say all is good and moving in the right direction for the company . Good morning Larry, The ARHT investor world is very discouraged right now as there has been no communication over the last month or so. Also, many times in the past it seems like investors are having to dig and find out AHRT events and happenings after the fact without them even being communicated or to find out at a much later date. Can you please give us a little hope/insight moving forward into 2021 as I know many of us need it right now . Thank you, Larry. Good morning Kevin, I am sorry people are discouraged, there is good news on the way. To clarify, between Nov 10 and Dec 18 we put out 6 press releases announcing new partners, high profile activations, permanent installs with recurring revenue and the first installation of the HoloPod at the #1 Rehabilitation Research Hospital in the world. On Nov 10 the stock opened at 0.305 and on Dec 18 the stock closed at 0.27. There was no news through Dec 31 and the stock closed at 0.30. There seems to be little correlation between news and stock performance. However, much of the world came back to work this week (we came back last week) and we will have news to share in January and beyond. Thanks for the feedback. Larry"More,JK,,4,0

3 months ago,@Massimo, you‚Äôre correct. And for everyone else who doubts, here is my view &amp; why I invested. When I invested in this company several months ago, the company wasn‚Äôt profitable but I did my DD, read a lot about the company and liked their technology and what they do to make it profitable, so I invested in future growth. At the investor meeting, I believe, in August, Larry said they expect to become profitable by the end of this year and as early as September, and he was right, they had good Q3 results. Since then, they have done a great job and are rapidly expanding their customer base. Some of you know, and some may not, they have some big clients, but they have NDAs with them and for that reason they are not allowed to disclose or market some events in which their technology is used. You have to be patient with this company, they are on the right track, and if not earlier, I believe the price will start to rise after Q4, which I expect will be very good, it should be sometime in January. I agree that they should be more involved in marketing, but remember that just one event with proper exposure would make it fly....

Here is another interesting article published on Oct. 20 about their partnership and ARHT's technology:‚ÄúNew Technology Sets a Higher Standard for the Virtual Experience Almo Professional A/V and ARHT Media, Inc. have an exciting new partnership and offering that could transform the landscape for digital meetings, events and hybrid/virtual learning. This new solution, in fact, could enhance almost any application in which a face-to-face interaction or presentation, prior to COVID-19, would have been the norm. The technology, developed by ARHT, is called Holographic TelePresence, and Almo is now the exclusive U.S. distributor for it. Through this solution, we can deliver a unique and highly engaging holographic display experience like never before.ARHT Media is the global leader in the development, production and transmission of high-quality, low latency hologram and digital content. Using proprietary technology, capture studios and standard projection equipment, Holographic TelePresence ‚Äúbeams‚Äù presenters into one or multiple venues simultaneously. You may also hear the technology referred to as HoloPresence, short for ‚Äúholographic presence.‚Äù Presenters can be located anywhere in the world ‚Äî they just need the equipment and access to the platform via the web. Along with a new hologram presentation platform known as the Virtual Global Stage, Holographic TelePresence enables hybrid events ‚Äî with some participants attending remotely and some attending live.This solution completely amplifies virtual interactions, online presentations, and hologram services in a way that your customer has never seen. With it, organizations, advertisers, and event marketers can reach a proportionately larger audience and deliver a premium hologram presentation that goes well beyond the 2D video call. Meanwhile, presenters benefit by being able to use key aspects of natural communication, like body language, to deliver a more engaging message and experience to attendees.Even though we all miss that in-person interaction, it is no longer the only way we do business. The mass deployment of video conferencing solutions in early 2020 was a big step forward for AV ‚Äî but video chat and 2D video conference software only scratches the surface of what‚Äôs possible. Holographic TelePresence brings prime-time to all of us and completely enhances the way we interact virtually.Read more about ARHT Media‚Äôs new Holographic TelePresence technology through Almo‚Äôs three-part blog series."https://www.commercialintegrator.com/communications/new-technology-sets-a-higher-standard-for-the-virtual-experience/More,JK,,6,0

5 months ago,Another article about Arht and Almo PartnershipVirtual Presence BY SVC STAFF PUBLISHED: OCTOBER 13, 2020According to Sam Taylor, ‚ÄúCOVID-19 has taught us that even though we all miss that in-person interaction, it is no longer the only way to do business ‚Äì and it has, in fact, given our industry the opportunity to tap into new technologies that increase the quality of the virtual experience and augment live events while improving productivity throughout the day.‚Äù He continued, ‚ÄúWe have partnered with ARHT Media to bring this technology to our partners, specifically those focused on rental and staging as we know that ‚Äòlive events‚Äô is currently one of the hardest-hit segments in the market. The technology is ready for prime-time and is poised to truly enhance the way we interact, both now and into the future.‚ÄùVirtual Global Stage is a premium digital on-stage experience online that eliminates the need for a venue, travel or the gathering of presenters and attendees. With ARHT Media‚Äôs patented multi-point broadcast solution, multiple 3D presenters in lifesized proportions can be brought to a virtual stage, side-by-side as if all parties were physically next to each other while actually being in completely different locations around the globe. With Virtual Global Stage, panel discussions, fireside chats, training events, town halls, product launches and more can all be executed in a virtual environment like never before.https://www.svconline.com/industry/virtual-presenceMore,Sammy,,3,0

She mentioned various events, but also said: "One is the forthcoming Green Carpet Fashion Awards on October 10. This truly pioneering show will combine cinematic footage with a fusion of augmented reality and visual FX, created using real-time game engines, and will have talent appearing as holograms. The companies behind this are no strangers to the music industry. Veteran show producer Kim Chappell has brought together an incredible team including UK music industry leaders NorthHouse for show design, visual FX and graphics and ARHT Media for holograms, a company I know many of you are familiar with for legacy touring."https://www.musicweek.com/opinion/read/viewpoint-sammy-andrews-on-the-future-for-live-music/081346More,JK,,3,0

This technology enhances the future of AR conferences, tradeshows, etc so well and everybody knows there are some discussions going on between the 2 companies which have close ties through Paul Duffy.

The problem with any company is that they have to generate enough income to pay all the salaries for the company employees and have some left over for growth. If not, they have to burn their cash savings or keep generating new capital by selling shares or getting loans. Not sure what the situation is with this company but I have a feeling they are not generating nearly enough to pay for all the employees and expenses. That's the bottom line. No matter how good of a product they have if they cannot generate cash to pay the salary it's over. That's where marketing and sales can make or break a company.

("ARHT" or "the Company") (TSXV:ART), is the global leader in the development, production and distribution of high-quality, low latency hologram and digital content. ARHT is pleased to announce that it is has entered into a Strategic Partnership with Los Angeles based special effects powerhouse TLC Creative to utilize ARHT Engine software, combined with the Company's recently launched Transmission Bundles, to deliver both online and in-person holopresence experiences.TLC is the official special effects supplier to the Los Angeles Lakers and has delivered audio visual experiences at the Super Bowl, the Olympics, television shows such as Dancing with the Stars and American Idol as well as with international recording artists including Lady Gaga, Usher, Jennifer Lopez, Miley Cyrus, and many others.A photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/841dea73-f493-48d0-8726-f797af1e2db7"When I first experienced ARHT's live two-way holopresence tech earlier this year in Seattle, I knew that I had to offer this technology to our very long list of both domestic and international clients," stated TLC CEO and Founder Kevin Bilida. "With so many events now being delivered online, ARHT's Virtual Global Stage is the perfect solution that will enhance the online experience, which we will showcase at a major event in September."TLC is also bringing the unique experience of seeing live special effects to virtual events. Bursts of sparks close to business presenters is a true surprise, creating excitement and real energy. Live confetti, laser aerials, and other live special effects, are adding impact to live streamed events in ways that can't be duplicated any other way."We are proud to be working with Kevin and the TLC team as they have introduced so many new technological innovations in special effects over the years and now, they are innovating online with us," commented ARHT CEO Larry O'Reilly. "By offering our ARHT Engine server and software technology combined with the cost savings of our Transmission Bundles it made the decision for TLC to promote our tech that much easier, while allowing us to focus on our highest margin products. It's a true win-win scenario, which will generate recurring revenues."More,Jackie Dodson,,4,4

I think of hologram as screenless projeciton of 3D image but I don't think that's the case here. Regardless, if the person looks like 3D then I suppose the end result is the same. They should explain the technology more clearly rather than just keep saying "hologram".,TM4G,,2,2

8 months ago,I think once people begin to realize that  the technology is here now and not just something you see in futuristic movies.Holograms or holographic symbols now more than ever will need to be integrated into our every day life,now because of the  Corona virus human contact with such things as buttons in an elevator,self check out,information kiosks to any other contact that can be eliminated.The use of holograms for communication or games is really a cool thought, with new technologies and innovation interest and popularity and of course 5G, little pioneers like ARHT MEDIA will thrive in this environment.More,james,,0,0

9 months ago,this companys platform is utterly amazing. I love the hologram quality and the fact that they can source multiple people as 3d AR holographic assets from anywhere in the world and put them together as holograms in their custom AR Global stages. the Global stage concept is already gaining fruition and I can only imagine this along with a few others $IP and $NTAR paving the way for AR in 2020 and beyond, these types of technology are what apple, google , microsoft, snapchatz facebook, all WANT and NEED. this space will be growing weekly as the year progresses. AR is the new tech of the post covid world. this includes 3D assets(holograms), geolocating and geoplanting said 3D assets, virtual conferences with AR, and the marketting industry with advertisable 3D assets instead of 2d images for advertising.
