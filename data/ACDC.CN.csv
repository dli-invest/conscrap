3 hours ago,In October, the Canadian small cap markets saw the entry of a new clean technology company that promised to revolutionize the growing battery and electric vehicles industries.  Armed with a massive patent portfolio and using the latest in artificial intelligence, Electric Vehicle Batteries Technology Corp., burst onto the Canadian Securities Exchange with a mountain of investor interest, averaging daily trading volumes in the millions.  ACDC is on the path to developing and commercializing a suite of battery management technologies that will revolutionize the Energy Storage Systems and electric vehicle market while also leading the battery industry with battery recycling technology.  With an exclusive partnership with one of China‚Äôs top battery technology companies, ACDC will be targeting the global market, including North America, South America, Africa and Europe to deploy its technology.More,Noiz,,16,0

4 days ago,I sure appreciate the work Noiz puts in. I am getting pretty lopsided with Acdc in my portfolio. this company gets more intesting every month. like I may win a frigging car in a while .... that be cool ... I feel if they were not as serious as a heart attack about their products ( with Daymak helping ) they would not engage in a very precarious legally binding effort as a lottery.  this would be a weird way of pumping and dumping agreed. anyway  August was predictable and slow - as usual with most stocks - Sept is when peoples start getting serious about trading ... I hope the shorts see this as well - longs are as greedy as shorts no doubt and the world goes round and round .... but ACDC has some sweet ideas and 98% sure they got all their ducks in a row to .... oh ya - blast the frig offMore,allenandyvrsl,,22,0

4 days ago,Forum member, Above Energy posted earlier today: i hope the 700.000 was not bought to further short the stock. What can be done about this from our side as the investors is to call the brokerage where you buy your shares and make sure or ask them how you can make the settings on your account to be sure your shares are not being borrowed out by your own broker to short this stock or any other stock that you own. I called my own broker today and made sure of that. üêò,Noiz,,0,0

4 days ago,I guess story time? Because i dont know what else to say at this point...The MMAT connection and the possibility that MMAT are looking to buy out ACDC. These are not my thoughts, but have been brought up on Reddit MMAT forum because the CEO of MMAT George Palikaras posted a cryptic message about the rockgroup ACDC this theory was also brought up by Youtuber Terry Younker that thinks ACDC is a good match for MMAT and that it is a intresting company overall even without the MMAT connection. My THOUGHTS on this intensified today when we once again couldnt brake upwards even though we had nothing but good PR the last 2 months and keep repeating the sam barcode pattern. MMAT have this year merged with a company TRCH. The reason for this was that MMAT wanted a "shortcut" to be listed on Nasdaq. Another reason was that TRCH was heavily shorted and the CEO of MMAT seem to really dislike shorters and have publicly stated we are going to Torch the shorts. Since then MMAT have bought out a Nano technology company to incorporate into MMAT. I have heard that the nano company was also shorted but iam not 100% sure of this. Could this be the reason we are in this seemingly infinite cycle we have seen the last 2 month's? We are a company that is a good acquisition for MMAT and fit their buisness and as we all suspect are also heavily shorted. I have said before it feels/seems/look like we are being shorted and accumilated in the same time. I cant explain the endless cycle any other way. Is ACDC a part of CEO George Palikaras plan to torch the shorts? I dont know... and honestly i dont give a üí© even tho i own alot of shares in both companies. Because at end of the day the result will be the same for both companies WE ARE GONNA LAUNCH, BRAKE THE STRATOSPHERE AND FLY TO THE MOON!!!! üöÄüêòMore,Noiz,,0,0

6 days ago,Bought Another 9.900 shares at 0.26 just now... I mean cmon üòÖ it was already ridiculus. Now its just beyond anything i can describe... Did they short the whole companies sharefloat with doubble the amount of shares that exist? Is MMAT really gonna buy up the company and someone know and a bit out is imminent. I dont know i dont care anymore. I/we have more then enough evidence this is not even mathematicly possible anymore. Every time we get Good news = BIG volume and then down to 0.255 and alot of screaming and crying from shorts.... Ok shorters you are right it cant go up because you have endless credit? Well they dont and the cost to borrow shares going up everyday... My shares are Free, i own them and i dont owe anyone any money to own my shares. Therefore it doesent cost me anything to hold... i just buy more until YOU cant afford to pay the intrest or get margin called because of to little liquidity.

What i didnt do is follow the normal human psychology= its going down i must sell. Think about that some People sold or had a stop loss at 43.000. Next time they look at their crypto it Will be gone and if they want it back it Will cost them alot more. Be like the elephant move with the herd but be prepared to stand your ground Alone.

12 days ago,Rich Power have 8.000.000 million shares in ACDC/CRYBF. DAYMAK have 10.000.000 million shares in ACDC/CRYBF and ACDC have equivalent amount of shares in dollar value in Daymak (less amount of shares but priced at 5.56) CEO Bryson Goodwin holds 20.000.000 million shares of ACDC/CRYBF. 9.000.000 million of those shares where exercised in march 2021 and he havent sold a single share since then. 3 companies heavily invested in eachothers futures and wellbeing. NR.1: One of the companies have existing and operating factories that already produce state of the art lithium batteries and have since april 2020 worked and invested millions of dollars to be able to produce bigger quantities then they already do in the 2 existing factories. There is also another 2 existing factories but i dont have full knowledge if they are used for Rich Power battery production but they are in the same conglomerate. That would make the total 4 factories plus One new factory that should be built and operating by now or soon. Company NR.2 is already one of the biggest EV vehicle company in Canada. And have a vast network of stores and chains all over North America that already sell their products that includes Wall Mart!They also have a new line of EV vehicles that already have reached a presale value of 781.000.000 million dollars and most of those sales are to wholesale companies and not retail, wich makes the sales more solid than retail orders.That company Daymak will soon be a even bigger player in the EV market in north America with their own factory.Dont focus to much on the Trilogy/Spiritus car ACDC will be the provider of all the batteries for Daymak products, and those products are becoming more and more popular for both recreational mobility and for comuting to work. For example in Scandinavia that includes 5 countries, its very normal to take use/take your bicykle for meeting friends and also for going to work. When i was young i bicykled to and from work every day all year around for 5 years straight (i really hated comuting with other people on buss LOL) Even when it was minus -15 degrees! Some people even change their tires to spike tires for the winter...Company nr.3 Extreme vehicle batteries technologies inc. OUR company last week finished and produced the first smart homewall battery and will soon start to send out the product to avaiting preorder customers. The smart homewall is better than equivalent product from Tesla in every way and cheaper. Soon the RV freedom battery will also start going out to avaiting customers aswell. When the news for that battery was released it crashed the website and CEO Bryson Goodwin have said that the demand have been very big. More products coming in Q4 of 2021. With a possible merger with Daymak the future of all these companies are looking very bright. I think thats enough for today. Even though i could continue for hours...Please like and comment so we can get the recognition we deserve. Thank You. üêòMore,Noiz,,0,0

12 days ago,Good morning fellow shareholders.I can see that some "fellow" investors are talking about other stocks on the board since yesterday for ex: Apple ticker APPL, Google ticker ALPHABET.Tesla ticker: TSLA, so lets explore :) The institutional money that have invested SO FAR in ACDC/CRYBF = ETF FUND HANS-GINS TECH MEGATREND This ETF is managed by a very big financial institution that have several other successful funds, the fund ACDC is placed in is up 10% in the last 3 months. The NAI 500 said in their article about ACDC/CRYBF being picked up by the ETF and i quote: ACDC press release also announced that the company was included in the TECH MEGATREND ETF. While the company have no trouble getting attention from retail investors, having institutional investors become shareholders may be a signal that EV battery tech is being taken seriously by institutional "smart money"  The article also mentions that Daymak already placed a RECIEVED purchase order of 2 million dollars worth of battery systems. I will post article in the comments. So what about the huge companies i mentioned in the beginning of this post? Well it just so happens they are also included in the same ETF = Hans-Gins tech megatrend.So we are in very good company. The NAI 500 article also shows that there is a Asian intrest in the company and that is not strange when you think that we are partners with a huge company RICH POWER a part of the RITAR conglomerate corporation. I repeat myself: You are buying a part of ASIAN industry when you invested in ACDC/CRYBF a very important industry. Thats why we are being manipulated so hard. I beg everyone here lets start to be as serious as they are. We will not be able to stop them with words its just giving them more attention. If they post fudd dont give it attention. If they post things that are not factual let one other member answer that with facts and the rest of us can like that comment. I apologize to all investors here for falling in that trap myself in the past and will better myself. Please do this for me and your own investment. Lets also cut down on feelings and rockets until we acctually launch everyone EXEPT THE STINK BUG he has earned his place as supreme leader of positive enforcement and i would miss the daily reminder that this is one day going to make me and all of the other investors alot of money. God bless you, God bless Canada, God bless America and God bless ACDC/CRYBF!More,Noiz,,0,0

Can someone from Canada please confirm this in the comments, i live in very different time zone... The company have historically released news on wendsdays before... and many times after market close. Thats why shorters started to push end of trading day today. They only have 2 market days left before news and are in panic. They will continue their attack tomorrow (well maybe not since we know the plan now LOL) so no matter what happens chill and hold. On wendsday last hours before close they will start to buy back! All actions and facts are pointing towards this. Iam gonna watch... hope they short and sell and pick up more free money :)  üêòüêòüêòüêòMore,Noiz,,0,0
14 days ago,Not only did we already have the catalysts to be at 1 dollar. We also have millions upon millions of shares that need to be bought back. Because of all the shorted shares this will go more insane than it already should. Imagine when even more news comes, and its not really more news we need. We just need more new people to know/understand  the company. The low volume of the last 2 days are helping them get what they want a low share price when we get more volume they will melt like ice in the sun. I bought MMAT metamaterials inc for weeks the cheaper it got the more i bought. Last week it finally turn around and i got in the green. Today i made some really nice profits. Same will happen here. It wasnt fun when i was losing money on MMAT but i held on and bought more. The money i wilm make in these 2 companies will pay for a new house or a rental. What are you going to do with your profits? Tell me in the comments. :) üêòMore,Noiz,,0,0
14 days ago,So Another day with the exact same volume like friday until the shorters dumped over 500.000 shares. Nobody is selling exept shorters. I Said it before they want to start covering from 0.21 CAD where they got trapped with 50 million shares in January anyone can see this for themself on shortdata(dot)ca. Borrowing fee on ACDC ticker didnt appear until 27 january. Thats the only new proof i have and the data everyone can see on shortdata(dot)ca. They have been waiting for low volume to be even able to breakthrough to a lower price hoping you will sell, so they can cover. Thats why we see them barking so loudly lately. I think new short data will be presented on august 31 or it wont be able until September 1. We already have the data fro. millions of shares shorted on USA ticker CRYBF since Trilogy news.  New margin rules will be in effect for shorters on September 3 in USA. I realky think this could be the week we start see some really intresting things. They can sell shares to themself lowering the shareprice but they cant buy shares from themself! Only from us :)  The tantrums and mocking they have been exelerating last couple of weeks...Think about it... who does normally show this kind of behaviour?? Think about it... Answer: Children and teenagers. What i want is not happening! therefore you are stupid and iam angry. Normaly this behavior is directed towards the parents. Well guess what we are the parents! The parents of the shares they want! :) and that boys and girls is why they are angry. I mean the do anyone here honestly think that if you have the money to buy 500.000 shares that you are so nervous when everyone just find out about bullish news Trilogy and first shipment of smart homewall battery and more news coming. That the logical thing is to dump those 500.000 at the last minute of the market. Thats desperation and people with the capability of buying 500.000 shares are not desperate, specially when everyone is waiting for big gains... üêòMore,Noiz,,0,0

18 days ago,Right from Remax. The deal ACDC supposedly made with Glenhalla estates to install chargers at an automall in Hope BC. Well, Glenhalla was foreclosed on by bank over 90 days ago. The NR was a month ago. Glenhalla doesn‚Äôt have control of the property but ACDC made an agreement? Too funny.   *COURT ORDERED SALE. 19 acre C-2 Commercial Development site at junction of three major highways: Hwy 1 (Trans-Canada), Hwy 5 (Coquihalla) and Hwy 3 (Crowsnest). Can be subdivided into multiple lots. Master plan for hotel and convention center, seniors housing, condominium, retail CRU's, drive thru, and auto mall. Opportunity to acquire a highway oriented gateway development site in Hope, BC at the eastern entrance to the Fraser Valley. Contract Listing Agent for a Confidentiality Agreement (CA) to receive access to the data room and form of offer. ALL OFFERS TO BE SUBJECT TO COURT APPROVAL.

19 days ago,When we had the 50% run up on June 10. The foundation for that run was layed on June 2. SP went from 0.225-0.27 and had a volume of 5.7 million. The 5 Trading Days after we had around average volume 1 million shares and traded around 0.25 CAD. On the 6th trading day (10 june) news of P.P at 0.50 CAD was complete and a volume of 18 million took SP to 0.40 around 50% increase in one day. Since then its just been more and more bullish news. Now the news that took SP to 0.95 CAD in february are starting to materialize and actual Product is on the way to customers, Daymak have presales of 750 million  wich will be revenue for ACDC soon. I dont get it... it feels like we are on a Island and no one can find us... When they do they are not gonna belive we had Bahamas to ourself... Anyway yesterdays news was offcourse amazing and puts to rest the bashing we had to deal with last months, where is the factory it doesent exist, they will never make a battery bla bla bla...I said last week we are repeating the pattern/consolidation after the february/june run. Well what iam getting at is that before june run we had a little spike, just like we had yesterday with 5 trading days after that also started like today 5% down and then sideways 4 days before it absolutley sky rocketed. Hopefully it is just following the pattern like it did so far. I know i repeated the same thing twice in this post, i hope people will get the point. And also i bought today at 0.27.  üêòMore,Noiz,,0,0
