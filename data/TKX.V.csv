3 months ago,Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Brian's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having $7000 worth of btc to $87000 worth of btc in just 9 weeks.

3 months ago,Why does this garbage keep dropping ?,Peter,,1,12
3 months ago,Just keeping r rolling down the TrackX, soon companies and investors are gonna realize the importance of this tiny little company. As we’ve fought thru a Global pandemic and are now merging out the other side. Companies are faced with a huge backlog and shortage of material. Not only that but thousands and thousands of drivers and personnel have all been lost. We are now faced with a supply shortage, due to the pandemic everything was shutdown or brought to a standstill. Now with  vaccines out and we’ll over half the population that’s been vaccinated and the loosening up on restrictions, the economy is now bursting at the seams. Plains, Trains and Automobiles, Company’s and Businesses ( The Supply Chain) can not keep up to the demand. To make matters worse there’s now a transportation shortage with a backlog as well. Much of the workforce was lost due to layoffs, sickness,bankruptcy and changes to vocation. Now more than ever before the importance of knowing what, when and where your inventory is at all times has become extremely important for companies and for customers as well. From a companies standpoint knowing where to find materials and keeping track of inventory are all so very crucial. TKX.V is just an $.08 cent a share teeny tiny little company with a  technology that helps with all that. Companies, suppliers, transportation and their customers can all be connected with one another. This is why Polaris and one of the biggest online used transportation companies has just hooked up with TackX and this is why I see this as an early Opportunity to invest into this little company before it really catches on. TKX.V gives companies and their consumers a valuable tool that allows them to Track, Trace and place a product….”In real time”, where it needs to be, thus it’s crucial right now to stay on top of things.
