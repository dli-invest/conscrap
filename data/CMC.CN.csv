11 hours ago,About Cielo Waste Solutions(CSE:CMC, OTCQB:CWSFF)Cielo Waste Solutions is a Canadian waste to energy company with a proprietary technology engineered to help solve the world‚Äôs garbage crisis. The Company‚Äôs technology transforms landfill garbage into renewable diesel, kerosene and naphtha fuels at a significantly lower cost than biofuel companies. The feedstock used in the Company‚Äôs green refineries is the world‚Äôs most available and inexpensive feedstock ‚Äì garbage; including household, commercial/construction/demolition garbage, used tires, railway ties, as well as all types of plastic that currently cannot be recycled. Cielo holds the exclusive global rights to its thermal catalytic depolymerization technology of which has been reviewed by recognized 3rd party engineers and is patented in the USA and Canada. Cielo‚Äôs first commercial renewable diesel refinery in Aldersyde, Alberta, has output capacity now projected to be ~500-1,000 liters per hour once continuous-flow is achieved. Cielo‚Äôs cost of producing renewable diesel at its Green Facility has been between C$0.45-$0.75 while the sale price in Edmonton for diesel, as of February 2021 was C$1.63 per liter, implying a strong margin. Cielo is targeted to become Canada‚Äôs first producer of renewable diesel that is fully compatible with federal and provincial-mandated fuels regulations. Cielo has already begun expanding its footprint by signing multiple Memorandums of Understanding pursuant to which third parties are in negotiation with Cielo to build, at no cost to Cielo, Joint Venture Renewable Diesel Facilities in Grande Prairie, Calgary, Medicine Hat and Lethbridge, Alberta as well as in Nova Scotia. Cielo will be the general contractor and operator of all the proposed JV Facilities. Altogether, the five green facilities will divert ~128,000 tonnes of waste per year from Canada‚Äôs landfills. To put this in context, Canada currently generates ~31-million tonnes of garbage per year and the world produces over 2 billion tonnes of waste per yearMore,Joseph,,6,0

14 days ago,They spent 16 years of researching and $80m to get to this stage. Turning garbage into high grade diesel and kerosene: transportation fuelWith international patents, Cielo has a unique solution for 2 major problems: 1.) Landfills give off harmful emissions2.) Governments are raising mandates for what % of gas must be renewableWay cheaper product than all competitors... Most biofuel use soybeans, corn, vegetable oil as feedstock. Feedstock is material distilled that turns into fuel. Since Cielo‚Äôs feedstock is garbage, their cost is very little.Low valuation = huge upside Entire company is only valued ~ $55mThis is most likely a result of not showing revenue for 16 years but game changing technology takes time.$GEVO is a comparable who uses corn as feedstock (more expensive). They are worth $1.8B and growing. That‚Äôs 60x the size of Cielo.$CWSFF product is cheaper &amp; has an additional environmental impact of reducing the methane from landfills.Allan said they are opening 40 facilities within 5 years. Each facility produces 24,000 liters/day With only 10 facilities, he said ‚Äúthe stock can go to a few dollars‚Äù Currently @ $0.1010-20 facilities in 2-3 years is reasonableIf $CWSFF achieves their goal of 40 facilities they can justify a billion dollar valuation $5b is ~100x in 5 yearsThey have one facility currently open, 5 more opening and will announce more later this yearReduce up to 5.2B pounds of garbage a yearCielo just had their first preorder in November 2020 of 60,000 liters for $1.25/literThey are finally able to efficiently produce &amp; are attempting to sell their product now: there‚Äôs a lot of potential catalystsMore,D,,16,0

15 days ago,Here are my thoughts. I think Cielo is an interesting long term play, especially if they can produce 1000L/day and remove sulfur from their fuel. In the near term I suspect they‚Äôll pull back around 0.15 because of how their warrants are structured. Having said that, often times, companies like to release news at the same time to offset people calling in warrants (look at SOS last week).

18 days ago,For those who don't follow this or are new, this company has incredible potential. There have been non stop hiccups and changes that have resulted in this project not being able to fully realize it's potential. What they do is nothing short of extraordinary and the potential for global adoption is mind blowing. All types of plastics and any garbage can be efficiently converted to high grade diesel. They will not require any government subsidies to remain profitable. Their material accuisition costs can be negative due to the nature of the feedstock, i.e garbage. The quality of the diesel produced will demand a premium market price. The design for the facility is modular and once fully realized will be able to commission new facilities in as little as 6 months. I think the figure was $50 million per facility.Cielo is already looking to commission a second plant of its own while also joint venturing multiple facilities with Renewable U Energy. The joint ventures benefit Cielo immediately and indefinitely, while providing revenue with no upfront debt. Win win for cmc.The hope is that the first facility (Aldersyde,AB) is able to meet the production quotas. Namely, 1000L per hour. Once everything is in place the design will be replicated at the remaining facilities. Still have the desulfurization process to finalize but would appear it's in the final stages.This has been a long ride. Seen this go to $0.30 all the way down to $0.03, maybe lower but stopped watching. Up almost 100% but not selling. This will go national, then international. For the diamond hands that can hold, once it hits the TSE....BOOM.More,Andrew,,12,0

4 months ago,Screw money and personal greed the world needs stronger minded souls to clean up the mess we have made for decades, forget what cash you might make and forget your one way of thinking of lining your pockets and put some effort towards cleaning up the world no different then when you throw a huge party at your house someone will have to clean the mess, the world is our stage and we are tripping over the trash we all made so put your faith into this garbage eating machine we all need.,Dale,,3,0
4 months ago,Like they say buy on rumours, sell on news ,   You can produce as many litres as you want per hour ,  but is it cost efficient, what is the octane of fuel produced,   And how much is market paying per litre wholesale,  who is the customer?    Non of these issues addressed.  Also , have not figured out how to de-sulferize the fuel so far ,  so long ways to go will be a bumpy road ,  and internal stock buying and selling certainly a means of raising capital for the company, do your d/d  be patient,michael,,1,1

4 months ago,I like the CEO of this company. I can read people well and he seems entirely transparent about everything. This is why I believe this truly will rise up once people get to know what‚Äôs going on,Carl,,1,0
4 months ago,Did I not read somewhere or hear that the target was 2000 litres/hour?,RVH,,0,0
4 months ago,While Cielo's initial goal was to start the Facility slowly after the latest improvements, with expectations between 200 to 500 liters per hour, the Facility produced 800 liters per hour of distillate. After approximately four hours of continuous operation, Cielo scaled back production to allow its engineers the opportunity to analyze any maintenance or functional concerns at that level. Cielo plans to be back up to 800 liters per hour of continuous flow as early as next week following minor tweaks by the engineers and 1,000 liters per hour shortly thereafter. Additional updates on the production volumes will be discussed in the live webinar on Thursday, October 22nd at 11 am ET (webinar details provided below). With the Facility producing continuously, to management's knowledge, Cielo is now the first company to convert multiple waste streams (garbage) into renewable diesel, naphtha and kerosene (jet &amp; marine fuels).More,Brett,,2,0

5 months ago,This should mean any day now. In their interview, they did say that the reason it was not climbing yet is that "everybody is waiting for us to announce that we are in positive revenue, we should see that by fall" They also answered in response for stock price forecast that they are planning to open up 40 plants in the next five years and that only 10 plants is enough to have the stock sitting at 10$. What i like about the interview is that the CEO doesn't seem like a Bull shytter, lol sorry for my typos it's for yahoo to allow the word on my post,Carl,,3,0
5 months ago,Cielo is relying on exemptive relief recently granted by Canadian securities regulatory authorities that allows it to delay the filing of its annual documents required by National Instrument 51-102 by August 28, 2020. In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, securities regulatory authorities in Canada have granted a blanket exemption allowing issuers an additional 45 days to complete their regulatory filings. Accordingly, the British Columbia Securities Commission ("BCSC") has enacted BC Instrument 51-517 - Temporary Exemption from Certain Corporate Finance Requirements ("BCI 51-517").Cielo estimates that the Annual Filings will be available for filing on or before September 20, 2020.More,Carl,,0,0
