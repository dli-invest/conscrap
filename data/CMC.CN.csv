30 minutes ago,Bought into this great forward looking company @.07 a tidy profit at this point to be sure.This current share price cannot be sustained at the present value. Trading @ 80 times book value while the industry average is 3 times book. CMC has a negative balance sheet and will have for some time as they continue to build operations. Frenzy buying at this point.Correction looming. Good company, great product.,Blaine,,3,1

1 hour ago,So price targets are around 18% accurate on average so that means this should hit $30 because $8 is clearly undervalued,Madop,,3,0
1 hour ago,To all longs, just look at GEVO, they are still developing there technologies where as Cielo are done with developing there technology, just some optimization &amp; tweaks. GEVO is very limited in the ability to process all plastic and landfill waste, Cielo's technology can process all plastics and just about all landfill waste. Cielo's technology is far superior to GEVO but GEVO SP after hours today is US$10.22. Cielo SP is way undervalued and the next few weeks will be exciting for the longs.,Dan,,5,0

2 hours ago,I‚Äôm just glad a Canadian company is pushing forward to create what will be a process to correct some of the wrongs we‚Äôve done to our planet. If I lose some money so be it, at least there trying to do the right thing.,Alex,,11,1
2 hours ago,Booyah to all longs, the run on the SP is just starting and many are predicting an $8 target but after, a brief 10min discussion with Don Allan, I think that the near term SP could be as high as $12 to $15 and as for the long term projection, the skies the limit. I will explain why I am so upbeat about this company.After many attempts I finally managed to connect with Don for a quick discussion. (Note to all, this is just my interpretation of the content of our discussion. Up front Don indicated that he will not discuss the SP or get involved in any speculation of any kind and the focus of my questioning should be on the technology). So by now most longs have some understanding of the Cielo‚Äôs technologies and its potential to address the many challenges that all countries are wrestling with respect to waste management and its environmental impact. See attached link : https://www.facebook.com/cielows/videos/824536298089209/. Once Cielo &amp; their JV partners builds the 50 plants that they are projecting, this will be huge and when they start exporting their technologies out of Canada it with are MEGA for Cielo and it‚Äôs SP. This is all great but I think, at this point, Cielo will be just scratching the surface.Don in his road show interview briefly mentioned that Cielo is investigating the possibility of using their technology to convert human waste/poop into fuel. If Cielo can actually use their technology to actually convert human poop to fuel, Cielo will be the next TESLA. Municipalities using Cielo‚Äôs technology to convert their plastics and other garbage into fuel will not save these municipalities any money because all they are doing is redirect their garbage from the landfill to the Cielo plants, this is great for the environment and huge revenue for Cielo and partners but zero financial benefit for the municipalities.A wastewater treatment plant that treats human waste/poop requires huge capital investments, to build by the city/government and huge capital to run and maintain these facilities. So if Cielo can use their technology to treat human waste/poop, every city in every country will rush to adopt the Cielo technology which will kill two birds with one stone, i.e. convert the landfill garbage and human waste/poop into fuel. There will be no need for cities to build these expensive waste water treatment plants anymore and the cost of running and maintaining existing wastewater treatment plants will be drastically reduced.Don sees no reason why their existing technology cannot convert human waste into fuel and my suspicious is that fairly soon there will be some news from Cielo indicating that they will be starting trials to convert human waste/poop into fuel. He also indicated that there is huge interest from the Canada government and some international organisations in their technologies but will not elaborate.More,Dan,,11,1

3 hours ago,I have been in Gevo since the 3$ mark and AMTX since 3.50$.. currently Gevo has a market cap of about 1.7 B$ and are ramping up production ..I recently abandoned that position at 13.40$ and a M/C at nearly 2 B. The last fireside chat was not inspiring in terms of site selection and  production..My sense is they are awaiting a buy out ..AMTEX is now about the same valuation as this stock but with a app.15$ share price.. They also own a 20% share in a new EV startup launching shortly known as NERO motors..Given the comparisons and valuations, CMC would be a 5X from here to be comparable to GEVO and a SP of about 8$ CAD. as GEVO and AMTX are in USD.. AMTX using the same comparison will be 4.5 times its current SP , so at 75$ US per share..I will be in this through to the 4-5 $ area, as I am sure we will see some dilution (a must for development and expansion)  but, It is NO AMTX.. best to all and GL..More,punishmint,,1,0

8 hours ago,This is great stock and I‚Äôve been in since .035 cents but the current market cap makes no sense. I know the market is forward looking but this is bonkers... like 3 years forward looking? I sold 75% of my position today at $1.40. Aldersyde will be the only operational facility for the next 2 years and will produce a max of 8,760,000 litres per year IF it runs at full capacity. That‚Äôs a max revenue of $14.6m (using $1.67/L from latest sale) for each of the next 2 years and that‚Äôs also being incredibly optimistic. We now have a market cap over $400m?!? I think we‚Äôll see a dramatic pullback very soon once people actually start doing some research and math on the actual time lines of this company‚Äôs revenue projections. It can‚Äôt sit at 100,000x price to sales for long. I think we might even see .40 again sometime this month at which point I‚Äôll gladly get back on the train.More,kyle,,5,1

If CMC can stay about $1 for 10 straight days, they may be able to start trading on the big markets. Once they‚Äôre on TSX, I think it‚Äôs reasonable to expect this stock to hit the $3-$4 range. A lot of people who buy high risk high reward stocks trade on platforms that CMC isn‚Äôt even available on, until it is traded on the bigger markets.,brennan,,5,1

I have a stronger presence on the CEO channel for most interactions, but obviously love seeing our presence grow across the globe on many channels.

This is especially important as the plastic recycling business is in terrible shape. Asia is no longer taking our plastic waste from North America.

They can take almost any feedstock other than glass and metals, including wood, plastics, tires, construction waste, and municipal organic and solid waste.From their website -"All developed countries throughout the world require a minimum blend of renewable diesel be used in all transportation diesel fuel. Cielo‚Äôs renewable fuel can be used in highway, air, ocean, and railway sectors, and as a fuel in remote off-grid communities. Cielo's renewable naphtha will be used in the diluent, condensate and gasoline blending markets."They've been working on this process for 17 years and have gotten to the point at their main facility, where they are able to have the process creating 1000 litres per hour of renewable fuels. The site is operating 24 hours a day. As of right now, they have an agreement to take CP's old rail ties and are using that wood as the feedstock.At this main facility in Aldersyde, Alberta, they will be upgrading the plant this summer to expand the capacity to 2000 l/h. They have also ordered the equipment they'll need for the desulphurization of the fuels they produce. This will allow them to get a better price for the fuels and also allow them to be used in more applications. This is expected to be installed by end of Q1 2021.In November they signed a pre-sale commercial deal to sell 60,000 litres in anticipation of this desulphurization, at $1.25 per litre. Cielo's cost is between 0.45 - $0.75. They are able to achieve this low cost to create the diesel because they are getting the feedstock(wood, trash, etc) at such a low price. That's compared to biodiesel which uses expensive crops like canola, corn, etc.The great thing is that Cielo has a very effective, easily duplicated process now. They have agreements in place with Joint Venture partners to build another 5 facilities throughout Alberta. They are expected to break ground in Dunmore(Q2 21), Grand Prairie(Q4 21), Calgary and Edmonton(Q2 22). They have also purchased land in Medicine Hat, unsure when construction starts there. The CEO has stated he wants 40 facilities underway throughout North America in the next 5 years.For the Dunmore facility, the plan is to build it to allow for 12,000 litres per hour capacity or 100 million litres per year of high-grade renewable fuel. The CEO anticipates that they will convert 200,000 tonnes of garbage into fuel to meet these numbers per year.Cielo's process is patented in the USA and Canada. They have all municipal and Provincial permits in place with little Canadian competition. There are no major renewable diesel producers in Canada that can sell to this market.There is an active group on CEO.ca where one of Cielo's board members, Lionel Robbins, frequently visits. He is a wealth of information and is very accessible to anyone with questions. I'd recommend anyone interested to go through his old posts where he covers pretty much everything. Here's his post history link:https://ceo.ca/@lionelAs far as how the Joint Ventures work with Cielo, the JV partners are responsible for putting up 100% of the initial funds to build the facilities. Here's how the numbers work out, per Lionel:"@Lionel - Good morning everyone. I have seen quite a bit of information with regards to Cielo's revenue share on JV's, short term cash flow, etc, so I just wanted to put out a bit of information from the MOU's and some previous PR's, to summarize... u/r.p.56 has most of the information correct here in terms of the JV agreements between RenewableU/Cielo, Seymour/Cielo and any follow-on JV's. The JV partner is responsible for sourcing 100% of the funds to build and commission the new facility, and then will receive 70% of the profits per year until they receive the equivalent of that build cost back, with Cielo getting the other 30%. Once the cap cost recovery is complete, Cielo will then receive 50.1% of the profits going forward, with the JV partner getting the other 49.9% That gives Cielo some significant cash flow even during the cap cost return phase, as they will have no debt involved in the project. In terms of the estimated 24 month period to build, Cielo has positive cash flow at that point as well, receiving 7% of the cap cost to manage the builds. They would receive the 7% as the build draws are taken, giving them some consistent cash flow throughout the 24 months before the plants actually fire up. With most of the JV projects estimated to cost in the $50M to $80M range (depending on initial volume planned), 7% on several JV's is not a small number for Cielo to see in their pockets while waiting for the cash flow from operations. Cielo will also be ramping up to the last phase of Aldersyde during that time, to produce 2000 LPH and have its own sales revenue for additional cash flow."Here's some more info from Lionel onMore,John,,6,1

We can't help wondering why it's publicly listed so early in its journey. Are venture capitalists not interested? So it seems shareholders are too busy dreaming about the progress to come than dwelling on the current (lack of) revenue.

4 days ago,About Cielo Waste Solutions(CSE:CMC, OTCQB:CWSFF)Cielo Waste Solutions is a Canadian waste to energy company with a proprietary technology engineered to help solve the world‚Äôs garbage crisis. The Company‚Äôs technology transforms landfill garbage into renewable diesel, kerosene and naphtha fuels at a significantly lower cost than biofuel companies. The feedstock used in the Company‚Äôs green refineries is the world‚Äôs most available and inexpensive feedstock ‚Äì garbage; including household, commercial/construction/demolition garbage, used tires, railway ties, as well as all types of plastic that currently cannot be recycled. Cielo holds the exclusive global rights to its thermal catalytic depolymerization technology of which has been reviewed by recognized 3rd party engineers and is patented in the USA and Canada. Cielo‚Äôs first commercial renewable diesel refinery in Aldersyde, Alberta, has output capacity now projected to be ~500-1,000 liters per hour once continuous-flow is achieved. Cielo‚Äôs cost of producing renewable diesel at its Green Facility has been between C$0.45-$0.75 while the sale price in Edmonton for diesel, as of February 2021 was C$1.63 per liter, implying a strong margin. Cielo is targeted to become Canada‚Äôs first producer of renewable diesel that is fully compatible with federal and provincial-mandated fuels regulations. Cielo has already begun expanding its footprint by signing multiple Memorandums of Understanding pursuant to which third parties are in negotiation with Cielo to build, at no cost to Cielo, Joint Venture Renewable Diesel Facilities in Grande Prairie, Calgary, Medicine Hat and Lethbridge, Alberta as well as in Nova Scotia. Cielo will be the general contractor and operator of all the proposed JV Facilities. Altogether, the five green facilities will divert ~128,000 tonnes of waste per year from Canada‚Äôs landfills. To put this in context, Canada currently generates ~31-million tonnes of garbage per year and the world produces over 2 billion tonnes of waste per yearMore,Joseph,,7,0

17 days ago,They spent 16 years of researching and $80m to get to this stage. Turning garbage into high grade diesel and kerosene: transportation fuelWith international patents, Cielo has a unique solution for 2 major problems: 1.) Landfills give off harmful emissions2.) Governments are raising mandates for what % of gas must be renewableWay cheaper product than all competitors... Most biofuel use soybeans, corn, vegetable oil as feedstock. Feedstock is material distilled that turns into fuel. Since Cielo‚Äôs feedstock is garbage, their cost is very little.Low valuation = huge upside Entire company is only valued ~ $55mThis is most likely a result of not showing revenue for 16 years but game changing technology takes time.$GEVO is a comparable who uses corn as feedstock (more expensive). They are worth $1.8B and growing. That‚Äôs 60x the size of Cielo.$CWSFF product is cheaper &amp; has an additional environmental impact of reducing the methane from landfills.Allan said they are opening 40 facilities within 5 years. Each facility produces 24,000 liters/day With only 10 facilities, he said ‚Äúthe stock can go to a few dollars‚Äù Currently @ $0.1010-20 facilities in 2-3 years is reasonableIf $CWSFF achieves their goal of 40 facilities they can justify a billion dollar valuation $5b is ~100x in 5 yearsThey have one facility currently open, 5 more opening and will announce more later this yearReduce up to 5.2B pounds of garbage a yearCielo just had their first preorder in November 2020 of 60,000 liters for $1.25/literThey are finally able to efficiently produce &amp; are attempting to sell their product now: there‚Äôs a lot of potential catalystsMore,D,,16,0

18 days ago,Here are my thoughts. I think Cielo is an interesting long term play, especially if they can produce 1000L/day and remove sulfur from their fuel. In the near term I suspect they‚Äôll pull back around 0.15 because of how their warrants are structured. Having said that, often times, companies like to release news at the same time to offset people calling in warrants (look at SOS last week).

21 days ago,For those who don't follow this or are new, this company has incredible potential. There have been non stop hiccups and changes that have resulted in this project not being able to fully realize it's potential. What they do is nothing short of extraordinary and the potential for global adoption is mind blowing. All types of plastics and any garbage can be efficiently converted to high grade diesel. They will not require any government subsidies to remain profitable. Their material accuisition costs can be negative due to the nature of the feedstock, i.e garbage. The quality of the diesel produced will demand a premium market price. The design for the facility is modular and once fully realized will be able to commission new facilities in as little as 6 months. I think the figure was $50 million per facility.Cielo is already looking to commission a second plant of its own while also joint venturing multiple facilities with Renewable U Energy. The joint ventures benefit Cielo immediately and indefinitely, while providing revenue with no upfront debt. Win win for cmc.The hope is that the first facility (Aldersyde,AB) is able to meet the production quotas. Namely, 1000L per hour. Once everything is in place the design will be replicated at the remaining facilities. Still have the desulfurization process to finalize but would appear it's in the final stages.This has been a long ride. Seen this go to $0.30 all the way down to $0.03, maybe lower but stopped watching. Up almost 100% but not selling. This will go national, then international. For the diamond hands that can hold, once it hits the TSE....BOOM.More,Andrew,,12,0

After approximately four hours of continuous operation, Cielo scaled back production to allow its engineers the opportunity to analyze any maintenance or functional concerns at that level. Cielo plans to be back up to 800 liters per hour of continuous flow as early as next week following minor tweaks by the engineers and 1,000 liters per hour shortly thereafter. Additional updates on the production volumes will be discussed in the live webinar on Thursday, October 22nd at 11 am ET (webinar details provided below).
