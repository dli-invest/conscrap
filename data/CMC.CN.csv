Tucked away in a quiet crescent beside the river, they share a professional looking office complex w/ one or two other entities. Much nicer than I was expecting tbh, but not extravagant by any means.I went in and was met by Shawn Frenette, CFO, introduced myself as an excited investor and he light up! He was very engaging, he promised to get someone on the merch train asap, as the groundswell of excitement has begun. Don was in a meeting, we exchanged waves through the glass. I'm very bullish, for me it's a no-brainer, my conscience can rest, as their technology lies with my ethics, not to mention they are local, Alberta needs all the love, plus I got in hella early son!!Next stop, a drive by of Aldersyde, AB for some more DD.CMC.CNCWSFFMore,black7rob,,33,0

5 days ago,I will try at the risk of being chastised to again explain the financial obstacles that are currently in the way for this company and ultimately us as investors. If you look at the statistics bar above and click on it, you will note several interesting and disturbing things..1. 320 Mill. shares..comparables: Gevo,,also over shared at 120 Mill. shares and Amtx = only 14 Mill. shares..(So what)? Well if you now look at the Market cap for CMC you will see at 1.25$ it currently stands at 400 Mill $,,You will also notice that in the graph where it says institutional $  (there is NONE)..SO What? Well without institutional investment it will be very difficult to drive up the market cap into the billions..and why are no institutions invested here..Market comparable  Gevo=18% of its shares owned and Amtx at 36% of its shares bought and supported by institutional $..In conclusion , there are too many outstanding shares in the current share pool (has to be changed) and not enough outside institutional funds in this company.The structure now is 30 cents for each of your shares at the growth of the co. by 100 Mil. in market cap..(that is pitiful)..Market comps:  Gevo: currently 10$ per share  app:120 Mil shares= 67 cents to the shareholder  per share for every 100 Mil of market cap growth..or current Market cap at Gevo of app.1.5 B$..( again lousy returns)  Amtx: 14 il. shares in float, current market cap of app. 450 Mil (similar to CMC),,Current share price: get this (20$) per share or a return to investor of 4.67$ dollars (not pennies) per every 100 Mil. gain in market cap..So what:  while CNC gains in value overtime..each share will earn back to the investor 30.C- 100Mil. of increased company cap..So to get to the magic 8$ is 6+  X from here.. This stock has had 2 weeks of trading at great volume and after the initial run up is treading water..It needs re structuring and I will keep the bulk of my investment in amtx..at the comparable market cap in today's comparable with GEVO ..Amtex will grow 3 X from 20$ to 60$ per share just to become even in market cap with Gevo at 10$ a share..Mark this. www.youtube.com/watch?v=sE6uhdVvsBoMore,TruthBurns,,3,4

8 days ago,I wanted to share this with this group because the person who wrote it doesn't seem to comment in here but it makes a whole lot of sense. "Bottom line, is Don has been working on this technology since 2005.  This video was done when they had the bench model little plant and had finally landed on the right catalyst to finish off the process. Whoever was their marketing people at the time then started shouting from the rooftops, like they were going to be up and running within months! Of course, as soon as they scaled up from that bench model plant, the boiler heat system didn‚Äôt work in continuous flow, so had to be changed.  Then the catalyst permits, AEP, and pretty much everything else that could happen, happened along the way from coming out of the garage to being a commercial scale facility.  It‚Äôs one of the reasons you won‚Äôt see too much aggressive marketing between 2016 and 2019.  Until we actually moved into the big facility in Aldersyde, people didn‚Äôt want to hear that we were ‚Äúalmost there‚Äù anymore.  If you look at GEVO‚Äôs history it‚Äôs similar. Their founder created the technology several years ago, the stock ran up on initial expectations, and then fell from grace.  It came back up once they actually got the commercialization scale questions answered, and they are off and running like we are (even slightly before us).We joke about us being an ‚Äúovernight success 16 years in the making‚Äù, but it‚Äôs not really that funny.  It was a long, frustrating and expensive path for Don and Cielo, where Don didn‚Äôt even take a personal salary for almost a decade. What we are seeing now, is thousands of followers instead of dozens, and thousands will soon become hundreds of thousands and hopefully millions.  Everyone wants to learn everything they can about the company, and will come across the 16 years of trials and tribulations.  If youtube had existing back in the 80‚Äôs, I often wonder how many videos of Steve Jobs declaring he has the best computer in the world built, years before that first apple actually came to life, would exist?  These days, with the instant access to media, people get to see all of these new technologies as they ‚Äúfail forward‚Äù, and all the real work that goes into getting to the finish line, and some see it as a cautionary tale when in reality its the way every great idea USUALLY gets there."More,Jaay,,47,0

8 days ago,Some interesting reading on the market that Cielo is tapping into. IMO I feel that Cielo has a bright future, despite the fact that the world is transitioning into EV which will take a long time.The fact that Cielo wont rely on subsidiaries and the feedstock is cheaper in comparison to Bio Diesel mitigates a lot of risk to Cielo. Facilities are cheaper and quicker to build, no shortage of waste etc. Majority of renewable fuel is made from crops, where as Cielo is using garbage (Plastics, cardboard, timber, food waste etc) and providing a solution to our increasing landfill problems which is huge.If Cielo can implement its technology successfully and quickly this is going to be huge for us shareholders.https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/accenture-energy/renewable-diesel-frontier-fuel-futurehttps://www.futurebridge.com/industry/perspectives-energy/renewable-diesel-the-fuel-of-the-future/https://www.neste.com/journeytozerostories/archive/3577-renewable-solutions/future-diesel-free-7-hard-questions-about-diesel-biofuels-and-icesMore,Daniel,,3,2

Most importantly, the CEO Don Allan has sold only small amounts of his stock and he has a very large position at 23.5 million shares.I've been investing for a while and have seen the potash, lithium and rare earth junior mining runups. For all of these, the insiders including the the senior exectives (CEO, CFO, COO etc), always sell large amounts of their stock.Cielo is the only company that I have seen where the insiders continue to hold the large majority of their stock positions,More,Samcheck,,11,0

16 days ago,Anyone claiming this is a pump and dump clearly does not understand the potential of this company. At 1000l/hr and desulfurization occurring Cielo has multiple plants that will be built at NO cost to Cielo. Given their great margins, Cielo will be profitable from each plant taking 30% of profits until the plant is paid off (2-3yrs) followed by 50% of profits. Then scaleability of this technology is enormous and the application in underserved countries that rely on diesel for electricity is massive.,Matt,,9,0

17 days ago,To all longs, just look at GEVO, they are still developing there technologies where as Cielo are done with developing there technology, just some optimization &amp; tweaks. GEVO is very limited in the ability to process all plastic and landfill waste, Cielo's technology can process all plastics and just about all landfill waste. Cielo's technology is far superior to GEVO but GEVO SP after hours today is US$10.22. Cielo SP is way undervalued and the next few weeks will be exciting for the longs.,Dan,,7,1

17 days ago,Booyah to all longs, the run on the SP is just starting and many are predicting an $8 target but after, a brief 10min discussion with Don Allan, I think that the near term SP could be as high as $12 to $15 and as for the long term projection, the skies the limit. I will explain why I am so upbeat about this company.After many attempts I finally managed to connect with Don for a quick discussion. (Note to all, this is just my interpretation of the content of our discussion. Up front Don indicated that he will not discuss the SP or get involved in any speculation of any kind and the focus of my questioning should be on the technology). So by now most longs have some understanding of the Cielo‚Äôs technologies and its potential to address the many challenges that all countries are wrestling with respect to waste management and its environmental impact. See attached link : https://www.facebook.com/cielows/videos/824536298089209/. Once Cielo &amp; their JV partners builds the 50 plants that they are projecting, this will be huge and when they start exporting their technologies out of Canada it with are MEGA for Cielo and it‚Äôs SP. This is all great but I think, at this point, Cielo will be just scratching the surface.Don in his road show interview briefly mentioned that Cielo is investigating the possibility of using their technology to convert human waste/poop into fuel. If Cielo can actually use their technology to actually convert human poop to fuel, Cielo will be the next TESLA. Municipalities using Cielo‚Äôs technology to convert their plastics and other garbage into fuel will not save these municipalities any money because all they are doing is redirect their garbage from the landfill to the Cielo plants, this is great for the environment and huge revenue for Cielo and partners but zero financial benefit for the municipalities.A wastewater treatment plant that treats human waste/poop requires huge capital investments, to build by the city/government and huge capital to run and maintain these facilities. So if Cielo can use their technology to treat human waste/poop, every city in every country will rush to adopt the Cielo technology which will kill two birds with one stone, i.e. convert the landfill garbage and human waste/poop into fuel. There will be no need for cities to build these expensive waste water treatment plants anymore and the cost of running and maintaining existing wastewater treatment plants will be drastically reduced.Don sees no reason why their existing technology cannot convert human waste into fuel and my suspicious is that fairly soon there will be some news from Cielo indicating that they will be starting trials to convert human waste/poop into fuel. He also indicated that there is huge interest from the Canada government and some international organisations in their technologies but will not elaborate.More,Dan,,13,1

17 days ago,I have been in Gevo since the 3$ mark and AMTX since 3.50$.. currently Gevo has a market cap of about 1.7 B$ and are ramping up production ..I recently abandoned that position at 13.40$ and a M/C at nearly 2 B. The last fireside chat was not inspiring in terms of site selection and  production..My sense is they are awaiting a buy out ..AMTEX is now about the same valuation as this stock but with a app.15$ share price.. They also own a 20% share in a new EV startup launching shortly known as NERO motors..Given the comparisons and valuations, CMC would be a 5X from here to be comparable to GEVO and a SP of about 8$ CAD. as GEVO and AMTX are in USD.. AMTX using the same comparison will be 4.5 times its current SP , so at 75$ US per share..I will be in this through to the 4-5 $ area, as I am sure we will see some dilution (a must for development and expansion)  but, It is NO AMTX.. best to all and GL..More,TruthBurns,,3,0

17 days ago,This is great stock and I‚Äôve been in since .035 cents but the current market cap makes no sense. I know the market is forward looking but this is bonkers... like 3 years forward looking? I sold 75% of my position today at $1.40. Aldersyde will be the only operational facility for the next 2 years and will produce a max of 8,760,000 litres per year IF it runs at full capacity. That‚Äôs a max revenue of $14.6m (using $1.67/L from latest sale) for each of the next 2 years and that‚Äôs also being incredibly optimistic. We now have a market cap over $400m?!? I think we‚Äôll see a dramatic pullback very soon once people actually start doing some research and math on the actual time lines of this company‚Äôs revenue projections. It can‚Äôt sit at 100,000x price to sales for long. I think we might even see .40 again sometime this month at which point I‚Äôll gladly get back on the train.More,kyle,,5,1

If CMC can stay about $1 for 10 straight days, they may be able to start trading on the big markets. Once they‚Äôre on TSX, I think it‚Äôs reasonable to expect this stock to hit the $3-$4 range.

I tend to monitor all of the investor channels, but don't jump into conversations a lot unless it's a direct question to me (and something I am able to answer, with publicly available information elsewhere).  I have a stronger presence on the CEO channel for most interactions, but obviously love seeing our presence grow across the globe on many channels.  My goal is to help provide information, but not be involved in the "buying and selling" talks, I'll leave that to all of you fine people! lol.

This is especially important as the plastic recycling business is in terrible shape. Asia is no longer taking our plastic waste from North America. Cielo‚Äôs business model is migrating to not only convert the plastic we have here in Canada and the US but also to become an importer of plastic waste.  In doing so, Cielo can clean up plastic waste from all affected countries and our world oceans.,John,,7,0

20 days ago,Thanks Kyle-Essentially what this company does is take waste, put it through their process, and end up with renewable transportation diesel, jet fuel, and naphtha fuel. They can take almost any feedstock other than glass and metals, including wood, plastics, tires, construction waste, and municipal organic and solid waste.From their website -"All developed countries throughout the world require a minimum blend of renewable diesel be used in all transportation diesel fuel. Cielo‚Äôs renewable fuel can be used in highway, air, ocean, and railway sectors, and as a fuel in remote off-grid communities. Cielo's renewable naphtha will be used in the diluent, condensate and gasoline blending markets."They've been working on this process for 17 years and have gotten to the point at their main facility, where they are able to have the process creating 1000 litres per hour of renewable fuels. The site is operating 24 hours a day. As of right now, they have an agreement to take CP's old rail ties and are using that wood as the feedstock.At this main facility in Aldersyde, Alberta, they will be upgrading the plant this summer to expand the capacity to 2000 l/h. They have also ordered the equipment they'll need for the desulphurization of the fuels they produce. This will allow them to get a better price for the fuels and also allow them to be used in more applications. This is expected to be installed by end of Q1 2021.In November they signed a pre-sale commercial deal to sell 60,000 litres in anticipation of this desulphurization, at $1.25 per litre. Cielo's cost is between 0.45 - $0.75. They are able to achieve this low cost to create the diesel because they are getting the feedstock(wood, trash, etc) at such a low price. That's compared to biodiesel which uses expensive crops like canola, corn, etc.The great thing is that Cielo has a very effective, easily duplicated process now. They have agreements in place with Joint Venture partners to build another 5 facilities throughout Alberta. They are expected to break ground in Dunmore(Q2 21), Grand Prairie(Q4 21), Calgary and Edmonton(Q2 22). They have also purchased land in Medicine Hat, unsure when construction starts there. The CEO has stated he wants 40 facilities underway throughout North America in the next 5 years.For the Dunmore facility, the plan is to build it to allow for 12,000 litres per hour capacity or 100 million litres per year of high-grade renewable fuel. The CEO anticipates that they will convert 200,000 tonnes of garbage into fuel to meet these numbers per year.Cielo's process is patented in the USA and Canada. They have all municipal and Provincial permits in place with little Canadian competition. There are no major renewable diesel producers in Canada that can sell to this market.There is an active group on CEO.ca where one of Cielo's board members, Lionel Robbins, frequently visits. He is a wealth of information and is very accessible to anyone with questions. I'd recommend anyone interested to go through his old posts where he covers pretty much everything. Here's his post history link:https://ceo.ca/@lionelAs far as how the Joint Ventures work with Cielo, the JV partners are responsible for putting up 100% of the initial funds to build the facilities. Here's how the numbers work out, per Lionel:"@Lionel - Good morning everyone. I have seen quite a bit of information with regards to Cielo's revenue share on JV's, short term cash flow, etc, so I just wanted to put out a bit of information from the MOU's and some previous PR's, to summarize... u/r.p.56 has most of the information correct here in terms of the JV agreements between RenewableU/Cielo, Seymour/Cielo and any follow-on JV's. The JV partner is responsible for sourcing 100% of the funds to build and commission the new facility, and then will receive 70% of the profits per year until they receive the equivalent of that build cost back, with Cielo getting the other 30%. Once the cap cost recovery is complete, Cielo will then receive 50.1% of the profits going forward, with the JV partner getting the other 49.9% That gives Cielo some significant cash flow even during the cap cost return phase, as they will have no debt involved in the project. In terms of the estimated 24 month period to build, Cielo has positive cash flow at that point as well, receiving 7% of the cap cost to manage the builds. They would receive the 7% as the build draws are taken, giving them some consistent cash flow throughout the 24 months before the plants actually fire up. With most of the JV projects estimated to cost in the $50M to $80M range (depending on initial volume planned), 7% on several JV's is not a small number for Cielo to see in their pockets while waiting for the cash flow from operations. Cielo will also be ramping up to the last phase of Aldersyde during that time, to produce 2000 LPH and have its own sales revenue for additional cash flow."Here's some more info from Lionel onMore,John,,6,1

CIELO will be the general contractor and operator of all the proposed JV Facilities. The feedstock that will be used in the Company's green facilities is the world's most available and inexpensive feedstock - garbage; including household, commercial/ construction/demolition garbage, used tires, railway ties and telephone poles as well as all types of plastic that currently cannot be recycled."At no cost toMore,John,,4,1

20 days ago,Cielo Waste Solutions recorded just CA$3,000 in revenue over the last twelve months, which isn't really enough for us to consider it to have a proven product. We can't help wondering why it's publicly listed so early in its journey. Are venture capitalists not interested? So it seems shareholders are too busy dreaming about the progress to come than dwelling on the current (lack of) revenue. It seems likely some shareholders believe that Cielo Waste Solutions will significantly advance the business plan before too long.,weeniewaggler,,0,3

21 days ago,About Cielo Waste Solutions(CSE:CMC, OTCQB:CWSFF)Cielo Waste Solutions is a Canadian waste to energy company with a proprietary technology engineered to help solve the world‚Äôs garbage crisis. The Company‚Äôs technology transforms landfill garbage into renewable diesel, kerosene and naphtha fuels at a significantly lower cost than biofuel companies. The feedstock used in the Company‚Äôs green refineries is the world‚Äôs most available and inexpensive feedstock ‚Äì garbage; including household, commercial/construction/demolition garbage, used tires, railway ties, as well as all types of plastic that currently cannot be recycled. Cielo holds the exclusive global rights to its thermal catalytic depolymerization technology of which has been reviewed by recognized 3rd party engineers and is patented in the USA and Canada. Cielo‚Äôs first commercial renewable diesel refinery in Aldersyde, Alberta, has output capacity now projected to be ~500-1,000 liters per hour once continuous-flow is achieved. Cielo‚Äôs cost of producing renewable diesel at its Green Facility has been between C$0.45-$0.75 while the sale price in Edmonton for diesel, as of February 2021 was C$1.63 per liter, implying a strong margin. Cielo is targeted to become Canada‚Äôs first producer of renewable diesel that is fully compatible with federal and provincial-mandated fuels regulations. Cielo has already begun expanding its footprint by signing multiple Memorandums of Understanding pursuant to which third parties are in negotiation with Cielo to build, at no cost to Cielo, Joint Venture Renewable Diesel Facilities in Grande Prairie, Calgary, Medicine Hat and Lethbridge, Alberta as well as in Nova Scotia. Cielo will be the general contractor and operator of all the proposed JV Facilities. Altogether, the five green facilities will divert ~128,000 tonnes of waste per year from Canada‚Äôs landfills. To put this in context, Canada currently generates ~31-million tonnes of garbage per year and the world produces over 2 billion tonnes of waste per yearMore,Joseph,,7,0

The market price of Cielo‚Äôs common shares has closed at or above $0.15 for the five (5) days leading up to and including February 12, 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cielo intends to deliver notice to holders of the Accelerated Warrants within the next 5 days in accordance with the terms of the warrant certificates representing the Accelerated Warrants. In the event that the remaining Accelerated Warrants are exercised, Cielo will receive combined gross proceeds of C$2,758,015.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cielo‚Äôs President and CEO, Don Allan, stated, ‚ÄúWe are pleased to report that Cielo‚Äôs recent record volumes of trading and strong stock performance allowed us to accelerate the expiry date of these warrants.

last month,They spent 16 years of researching and $80m to get to this stage. Turning garbage into high grade diesel and kerosene: transportation fuelWith international patents, Cielo has a unique solution for 2 major problems: 1.) Landfills give off harmful emissions2.) Governments are raising mandates for what % of gas must be renewableWay cheaper product than all competitors... Most biofuel use soybeans, corn, vegetable oil as feedstock. Feedstock is material distilled that turns into fuel. Since Cielo‚Äôs feedstock is garbage, their cost is very little.Low valuation = huge upside Entire company is only valued ~ $55mThis is most likely a result of not showing revenue for 16 years but game changing technology takes time.$GEVO is a comparable who uses corn as feedstock (more expensive). They are worth $1.8B and growing. That‚Äôs 60x the size of Cielo.$CWSFF product is cheaper &amp; has an additional environmental impact of reducing the methane from landfills.Allan said they are opening 40 facilities within 5 years. Each facility produces 24,000 liters/day With only 10 facilities, he said ‚Äúthe stock can go to a few dollars‚Äù Currently @ $0.1010-20 facilities in 2-3 years is reasonableIf $CWSFF achieves their goal of 40 facilities they can justify a billion dollar valuation $5b is ~100x in 5 yearsThey have one facility currently open, 5 more opening and will announce more later this yearReduce up to 5.2B pounds of garbage a yearCielo just had their first preorder in November 2020 of 60,000 liters for $1.25/literThey are finally able to efficiently produce &amp; are attempting to sell their product now: there‚Äôs a lot of potential catalystsMore,D,,16,0

last month,Here are my thoughts. I think Cielo is an interesting long term play, especially if they can produce 1000L/day and remove sulfur from their fuel. In the near term I suspect they‚Äôll pull back around 0.15 because of how their warrants are structured. Having said that, often times, companies like to release news at the same time to offset people calling in warrants (look at SOS last week).

last month,For those who don't follow this or are new, this company has incredible potential. There have been non stop hiccups and changes that have resulted in this project not being able to fully realize it's potential. What they do is nothing short of extraordinary and the potential for global adoption is mind blowing. All types of plastics and any garbage can be efficiently converted to high grade diesel. They will not require any government subsidies to remain profitable. Their material accuisition costs can be negative due to the nature of the feedstock, i.e garbage. The quality of the diesel produced will demand a premium market price. The design for the facility is modular and once fully realized will be able to commission new facilities in as little as 6 months. I think the figure was $50 million per facility.Cielo is already looking to commission a second plant of its own while also joint venturing multiple facilities with Renewable U Energy. The joint ventures benefit Cielo immediately and indefinitely, while providing revenue with no upfront debt. Win win for cmc.The hope is that the first facility (Aldersyde,AB) is able to meet the production quotas. Namely, 1000L per hour. Once everything is in place the design will be replicated at the remaining facilities. Still have the desulfurization process to finalize but would appear it's in the final stages.This has been a long ride. Seen this go to $0.30 all the way down to $0.03, maybe lower but stopped watching. Up almost 100% but not selling. This will go national, then international. For the diamond hands that can hold, once it hits the TSE....BOOM.More,Andrew,,12,0

5 months ago,While Cielo's initial goal was to start the Facility slowly after the latest improvements, with expectations between 200 to 500 liters per hour, the Facility produced 800 liters per hour of distillate. After approximately four hours of continuous operation, Cielo scaled back production to allow its engineers the opportunity to analyze any maintenance or functional concerns at that level. Cielo plans to be back up to 800 liters per hour of continuous flow as early as next week following minor tweaks by the engineers and 1,000 liters per hour shortly thereafter. Additional updates on the production volumes will be discussed in the live webinar on Thursday, October 22nd at 11 am ET (webinar details provided below). With the Facility producing continuously, to management's knowledge, Cielo is now the first company to convert multiple waste streams (garbage) into renewable diesel, naphtha and kerosene (jet &amp; marine fuels).More,Brett,,2,0
