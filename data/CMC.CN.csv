yesterday,Q: What day was the TSX Venture paperwork filed and do you know how the requirement differs for the TSX?A: Paperwork was started at the same time as the NR was released (March 15th). The timing for completing the listing application varies by factors such as getting all of the documentation completed from our end (PIF‚Äôs from all directors and officers, criminal background checks, etc), and the number of applications TSX is processing ahead of us. We have completed all of our required paperwork and the initial estimates were for it to take 30 to 60 days to make the uplist happen. We still are estimating that to be the timeline. In terms of then uplisting to the big TSX board, our goal is to get there as soon as possible. If you look at the listing requirements for TSX-V you will see that as of March 15th Cielo met those requirements, which started that process. The requirements for the TSX may in fact be accomplished even during the TSX-V listing process, or shortly thereafter, so in theory we could be hitting the TSX-V board and almost immediately be starting down the path to get to the TSX. The acceleration of warrants and other financial raises has certainly helped with that possibility as having a strong balance sheet and cash position is a big part of qualifying for the big board.Q:  Is there any progress on getting plastics deemed as acceptable feedstock for biofuels? What do you feel the outlook is on this front?A: Our lobbyist firm in Ottawa has been doing some fantastic work on that front on our behalf, and with the immense pressure on our government to solve the growing plastics waste crisis we feel that it is not a matter of ‚Äúif‚Äù the reclassification happens, but only a matter of ‚Äúwhen‚Äù.More,VamTaRicK,,7,0

2 days ago,Q &amp; A answers from Cielo's Lionel Robins                                          Q: I would like to know the current planned output of all of the planned facilities and if you are willing, the maximum output capacity that you believe they could hit?A: As we bring more and more feedstock agreements online, we will be able to adjust the planned output as we go. We don‚Äôt want to say ‚Äúthis facility will produce X litres, and this facility will produce Y litres‚Äù. You will  remember we had initially done that for Medicine Hat, where we declared 4000 lph, then shortly thereafter signed the rail tie supply agreement and bumped to 10,000 lph, and then to 12,000 lph from there. Each facility will be built with that minimum 4,000 lph modular unit, with the goal of scaling that up as soon as possible, if not right at the beginning. When we do site selection, we are looking at the opportunity to expand to at least 24,000 lph at most of those facilities, for initial build and future expansion. As long as there is enough feedstock to keep the increased capacity flowing, there certainly won‚Äôt be any worries of finding a market for the fuels that come out the other end. There is an economy of scale to the facilities producing as much capacity as possible right from the start, so if we can justify a territory having more than 4000 lph we will definitely make the leap forward.Q: What do the current production numbers at Aldersyde look like and how much diesel is currently being stored?A: I can‚Äôt comment to exact production numbers outside of NR, and our goal is to provide volume updates as we work the desulfurization systems into place. We have taken opportunities while waiting for that equipment to be fabricated, to do shut down maintenance and other upgrades to the facility, as there is no point in storing large quantities of high sulphur diesel to wait for the sulphur removal process. Once we have the ability to produce the ultra-low sulphur sellable product we will give more production updates on volumes as well.Q: Who will actually own the JV sites when they are completed? A: The JV facilities will be owned 50.1% by Cielo and 49.9% by the JV partner. The 70/30 profit split is an agreement to help the partner who is funding the build recover their capex relatively quickly, but it doesn‚Äôt impact the actual ownership % of each partner in the facility itself.Q:  Does the product burn cleaner than standard diesel and/or biodiesels currently on the market?A: Yes, the renewable diesel we produce has a much higher cetane rating than traditional fossil diesel, and as such has less ghg emissions. There are estimates from other parties that renewable diesel emits 60% fewer ghg‚Äôs (or higher).Q:  When do you anticipate having completed 90 days of continuous flow? A:Can‚Äôt comment on that at this point, but will be identified in upcoming production updates.Q: Any update on the progress of getting the plastic certificate for Aldersyde? A: AEP is focused on the approval for rail ties specifically as our next commercial scale certification (as our NR released tonight will explain why), but plastics are still on the list. There is an issue with the CI classification of waste plastics, where it  is not technically classified as a renewable fuel feedstock yet so until the federal government changes that classification we can only use up to about 15% of our total feedstock as plastic so there isn‚Äôt a big panic for the AEP to push plastics to the top of the certification pile while that is happening. We have bench tested 63 type of waste feedstocks to date so we can source many other large waste quantities before we attack the plastics problem.Q: Can you give any estimate as to how much income the 30% markup on the catalyst will provide?A: Our goal is to release proformas for Cielo as it relates to the JV and other facilities. We have not released that yet, but when we do the expense line for the catalyst will be identified on there and can then be worked backwards on the 30% markup formula.Q: In his March 8th video , Don rang the bell mentioning licensing, any comment on what that could look like? I see this as a near zero overhead method of increasing revenue with the only downside being protection of the IP.A: Yes, you hit the nail on the head on both ends of that debate. The ability to generate ‚Äúcost free‚Äù revenue from technology licensing agreements is attractive, but with that comes the danger of putting the technology in others‚Äô hands that may immediately start trying to reverse engineer the entire process. Don‚Äôs goal is to grow Cielo with JV and company-owned facilities to start, to put Cielo in a position to have the financial resources to protect itself against those attempts  (at least as much as one possibly could) prior to exploring technology licensing agreements outside of North America.Q: What day was the TSX Venture paperwork filed and do you know how the requirement differs for the TSX?A: Paperwork was stMore,VamTaRicK,,16,0

2 days ago,CIELO RECEIVES CONDITIONAL GRANT FROM ALBERTA INNOVATES FOR CDN$500,000.00&nbsp;&nbsp;April 7, 2021 ‚Äì Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada ‚Äì&nbsp;Cielo Waste&nbsp;Solutions Corp. (CSE: CMC), (OTCQB: CWSFF), (CNSX:CMC.CN), ("Cielo"&nbsp;or the&nbsp;"Company")&nbsp;is pleased to announce that it has received a conditional grant from Alberta Innovates in the amount of CDN$500,000.00 toward the nearly CDN$900,000.00 needed for a commercial feedstock demonstration of used railway ties at its pilot facility in Aldersyde, Alberta.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commercial trial must first be granted approval from Alberta Environment &amp; Parks (‚ÄúAEP‚Äù). Cielo‚Äôs engineers have been working since last fall to complete the material testing, bench-scale trials and process modeling that will help facilitate approval from AEP. Cielo intends to then implement a 100 tonne demonstration, followed by a larger 500 tonne demonstration. The timeframe for the demonstrations and analysis is anticipated to be approximately 3 months.Cielo submitted the initial grant application to Alberta Innovates in the spring of 2020 and is pleased with the support from key members of the organization for this large scale testing, which, when completed, could, at the discretion of AEP and its view of the trial results, allow Cielo to produce renewable fuels from used railway ties on an ongoing basis.&nbsp;Cielo currently has a feedstock agreement with a large Canadian railway company that is looking for a more renewable and circular economy to dispose of its used railway ties.&nbsp;&nbsp;The current feedstock agreement is for up to 1,000,000 used railway ties per year with incentives in place to increase this number.Don Allan, President and CEO of Cielo, stated ‚ÄúWe believe that the eyes of the Railway Tie Association are on us to see these results and that, when successful, Cielo will have the most environmentally friendly solution&nbsp;&nbsp;for 10‚Äôs of millions of used railway ties per year from all across North America.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, many used railway ties are being incinerated by cogen facilities for power but already some states in the US and provinces in Canada are banning the incineration of these ties due to potential toxic ash and other harmful emmissions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cielo is proud to have developed a process that does not currently have any toxic waste or emmissions ‚ÄúThe Honourable Finance Minister of Alberta, Travis Toews stated ‚ÄúI am pleased to hear that Cielo Waste Solutions Corp. has been awarded a CDN$500,000.00 conditional grant from Alberta Innovates. This funding will support Cielo as it tests its ability to utilize materials in its process to create renewable fuels. Cielo is a great example of the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit of Albertans. I am eager to see this Alberta based company expand their operations in the province and contribute to Alberta‚Äôs economic recovery.‚ÄùMore,Reps,,38,0

6 days ago,For those that don‚Äôt know the different exchanges and what up listing can mean for a stock!! GLTAUp-listing refers to when a company listing (stock) moves from a lower perceived exchange to a larger more recognizable one. A broad U.S. hierarchy listing would look something like: Over the Counter (OTC:BB) to AMEX to Nasdaq (there are three tiers) to NYSE. The simple common sense answer is that up-listing should be good for price, liquidity, and potential appreciation. First, by moving up to stronger and more recognizable exchanges, the stock will broaden its available shareholder base, some firms, funds, institutions do not invest in stocks listed on the lower tier exchanges. Secondly, the larger and more stable the company, the more likely it is that will be listed on the stronger exchange, greater revenue, larger shareholder base, price over $5, and larger market capitalization to name a few. Thirdly, the exchanges and market participants should offer greater liquidity, price discovery, and be more active in supporting and trading the stock.Two notes of caution and emphasis. I would expect the difference at the low end (OTC to AMEX or even skipping one tier and going to lowest level of Nasdaq) to be much greater than a firm moving from Nasdaq to NYSE, which is likely negligible. Some of the largest companies in the world are on NASDAQ. Additionally, gambling on a short-term profit from up-listing is risky. While you may find some research that says there is an average move of x% or x% better than the market returned over that time period, the company and its fundamentals will win out in the long-term. A small utility will likely not be as volatile as a hot internet or biotech stock making the move. The utility would also likely have less shareholder turnover compared to the biotech, or traders trying to capture the short-term news potential and excitement with a company development and greater visibility.More,Mike,,9,0

10 days ago,Summary of financials-(not my work)Quarter ending January. Looking into company past operations. November December January. No sales. No revenue. Current assets cash available was less than current debt obligations. Hence the 10M changed to I believe 14M money raised in February to pay these current debts and invest in continued developments desulphurization and doubling Aldersyde. Company has a book value. Money spent on Aldersyde plant has a asset value. Looks like close to 18M. Asset value increased. Long term debt did not. However over the course of the year significant dilution occured. 6M from issuance of shares and convertible debentures etc. Basically financials are as expected. Nothing was expected. 1st quarter financials due out in September should be the first financials with a full quarter of production and sales if all targets are met. This quarter nothing expected. Next quarter maybe some sales and cash from the recent financing and debts paid. September financials target for 1000L/hr production insight to margins. 90d flow to complete it n May provide full financing from lenders for JVs. March desulphurization. Possible additional plant expansion news. Debt financing/share issuance to fund Edmonton self owned. Near term horizon outlook. Aldersyde double production August hopefully.

(‚ÄúRUEI‚Äù).  RUEI is the company with which Cielo has entered into previously announced memorandums of understanding (the ‚ÄúMOUs‚Äù) with respect to joint ventures (the ‚ÄúJVs‚Äù) to be formed to build and operate multiple facilities in British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Nova Scotia, and the United States.    Cielo is pleased to announce that its director, Lionel Robins, has resigned from his role of CEO with RUEI and will be appointed Chief Operating Officer of Cielo effective April 1, 2021.  Cielo is also pleased to announce the appointment of Raphael Bohlmann as Vice President of Marketing.  Mr. Bohlmann was the President of RUEI and has resigned from this position and remains only as Director of RUEI. (see attachment) Mr. Robins started his 1st Automotive Dealership in 2006 which have since grown to 6 locations across Northern Alberta. His other business holdings have included  oil and gas industry service companies, hotel properties, a professional education and development business, and several commercial real estate holdings.  Mr. Robins served 2 terms on the STARS Air Ambulance Board of Directors, and also served as Chair of the 2018 Alberta Summer Games in Grande Prairie, Alberta.  His experience in commercial finance and business development will suit him well in this new role. Mr. Bohlmann is a Red Seal Journeyman electrician and has owned several franchise restaurants.  Mr. Bohlmann was Chief Marketing Officer and Director of Human Resources for Revolution Auto Group.  Here, he developed and implemented a multi-million-dollar rebranding of the company, negotiating the naming rights to the local arena and events center.  He also initiated a successful staff and management leadership model which inspired him to develop Motivate U Performance Education in 2015, a company that focused on business training development and leadership at all levels.  Mr. Bohlmann gained tremendous knowledge of ‚ÄúStrategic Marketing Management‚Äù from attending Stanford University in Palo Alto CA, USA in 2016.  Mr. Bohlmann established a marketing company, Brand U Agency, which strategizes company brand development, logo creation, websites, and software development. Don Allan, President and CEO of Cielo, stated, ‚ÄúThe appointment of these two gentlemen brings a tremendous amount of experience and passion to our leadership team and reduces my workload so I may focus on the further growth of the company.   As well, RUEI has advised Cielo that, as of March 6, 2021, Ryan Jackson has been named new CEO of RUEI and Murray Trollope has been named CFO. Jeff Seymour, principal of Seymour Capital Ltd., which has been acquired by RUEI as previously announced, also joins the board of directors of RUEI. Update on Joint Ventures RUEI has advised Cielo that it is working on the draft agreement(s) to form the JVs with its legal team and will present initial drafts to Cielo in the near term.  RUEI also confirms it is funding current engineering costs at the facility in Dunmore, Alberta and will continue to advance funds as required as the parties negotiate the terms of the JVs.   Mr. Allan further states ‚ÄúI look forward to working with newly appointed RUEI CEO Ryan Jackson on the JVs and all the facility locations.  It is also great news to have Medicine Hat (Dunmore) advancing full speed ahead as planned!‚Äù On behalf of the Board of Directors of the Company, Cielo Waste Solutions Corp.‚ÄúDon Allan‚ÄùDon Allan, President / CEO / DirectorMore,scb,,16,4

17 days ago,For anyone who is sceptical of the long term potential of Cielo you may want to check out the film "A Plastic Ocean" that is available on Netflix. It demonstrates just how much plastic waste is out in the environment and how great of a need there is for getting rid of it. Personally I believe garbage to fuel is one of the best monetary uses for this plastic waste as the transition to electric cars is likely far away and still has many obstacles, whereas more carbon neutral fuel sources like this can be a better environmental way to fill this need until then. Anyway the film although not directly relating to garbage as fuel, is still something to look into if you are interested in the long term potential of Cielo. GLTA!More,Garrett,,6,1

18 days ago,Compare CMC to GEVO which was +18% on Friday alone. Not bashing GEVO in any way, but CMC has a superior patented technology and business. Cielo doesn‚Äôt require vast plots of farmland as a feedstock like GEVO and they can use almost any form of garbage or waste as an input and they have current production.. something GEVO does not have. The valuation is a fraction of GEVO on an EV basis. The only thing really holding cielo back right now is a lack of exposure and not being traded on a major index which is all going to change in due time. CMC is a star business and a true leader in its niche. This is a steal right now but it won‚Äôt be for long IMOMore,scb,,20,3

20 days ago,I want to make a comment about the total amount of short positions in Cielo on the CSE. I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs institutional. The volume in this stock is too low for institutionals. I think they are big retailers playing a very tricky game. Up till now the game of shorting Cielo these past few weeks has been easy. They sell high and buy low and we are all playing this game with them by buying high and selling low. If you buy the stock keep it or sell higher. Why else would you buy this stock? Don‚Äôt create a stop loss, don‚Äôt sell. That way the shorters will have to buy back higher and eventually loose their interest in shorting this stock. This stock has got very much potential, but we have to be patient. Don‚Äôt panic, don‚Äôt sell!Happy to hear your thoughts about my comment. Please share. Thank you.More,Ray,,28,1

Cielo will have its highs and lows like any stock and yes it will rise with good news and get dumped and fall.  If you‚Äôre in this for the short term and going to panic by the daily dips then you‚Äôre going to have issues sleeping at night and could probably find better stocks to short or day trade.  This is a long position and I truly believe in the coming months and years we will see $2 then $5 and maybe even $10 one day!

I would have much preferred slow steady growth with actual value than stock manipulation.

The airline has set ambitious climate targets to realize a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) throughout its global operations by 2050.  To reach this, Air Canada has set absolute midterm GHG net reduction targets by 2030 in its air and ground operations compared to its 2019 baseline, and has committed to investing $50 Million in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and carbon reductions and removals.,MIKE,,3,0

27 days ago,So I stopped by the Red Deer, AB office yesterday, I'm always passing through, so I wanted to get a look at their building, the branding, and get a window into how they spend their money.Let me say, I was very pleased with my findings! Tucked away in a quiet crescent beside the river, they share a professional looking office complex w/ one or two other entities. Much nicer than I was expecting tbh, but not extravagant by any means.I went in and was met by Shawn Frenette, CFO, introduced myself as an excited investor and he light up! He was very engaging, he promised to get someone on the merch train asap, as the groundswell of excitement has begun. Don was in a meeting, we exchanged waves through the glass. I'm very bullish, for me it's a no-brainer, my conscience can rest, as their technology lies with my ethics, not to mention they are local, Alberta needs all the love, plus I got in hella early son!!Next stop, a drive by of Aldersyde, AB for some more DD.CMC.CNCWSFFMore,black7rob,,33,0

27 days ago,I will try at the risk of being chastised to again explain the financial obstacles that are currently in the way for this company and ultimately us as investors. If you look at the statistics bar above and click on it, you will note several interesting and disturbing things..1. 320 Mill. shares..comparables: Gevo,,also over shared at 120 Mill. shares and Amtx = only 14 Mill. shares..(So what)? Well if you now look at the Market cap for CMC you will see at 1.25$ it currently stands at 400 Mill $,,You will also notice that in the graph where it says institutional $  (there is NONE)..SO What? Well without institutional investment it will be very difficult to drive up the market cap into the billions..and why are no institutions invested here..Market comparable  Gevo=18% of its shares owned and Amtx at 36% of its shares bought and supported by institutional $..In conclusion , there are too many outstanding shares in the current share pool (has to be changed) and not enough outside institutional funds in this company.The structure now is 30 cents for each of your shares at the growth of the co. by 100 Mil. in market cap..(that is pitiful)..Market comps:  Gevo: currently 10$ per share  app:120 Mil shares= 67 cents to the shareholder  per share for every 100 Mil of market cap growth..or current Market cap at Gevo of app.1.5 B$..( again lousy returns)  Amtx: 14 il. shares in float, current market cap of app. 450 Mil (similar to CMC),,Current share price: get this (20$) per share or a return to investor of 4.67$ dollars (not pennies) per every 100 Mil. gain in market cap..So what:  while CNC gains in value overtime..each share will earn back to the investor 30.C- 100Mil. of increased company cap..So to get to the magic 8$ is 6+  X from here.. This stock has had 2 weeks of trading at great volume and after the initial run up is treading water..It needs re structuring and I will keep the bulk of my investment in amtx..at the comparable market cap in today's comparable with GEVO ..Amtex will grow 3 X from 20$ to 60$ per share just to become even in market cap with Gevo at 10$ a share..Mark this. www.youtube.com/watch?v=sE6uhdVvsBoMore,TruthBurns,,2,4

last month,I wanted to share this with this group because the person who wrote it doesn't seem to comment in here but it makes a whole lot of sense. "Bottom line, is Don has been working on this technology since 2005.  This video was done when they had the bench model little plant and had finally landed on the right catalyst to finish off the process. Whoever was their marketing people at the time then started shouting from the rooftops, like they were going to be up and running within months! Of course, as soon as they scaled up from that bench model plant, the boiler heat system didn‚Äôt work in continuous flow, so had to be changed.  Then the catalyst permits, AEP, and pretty much everything else that could happen, happened along the way from coming out of the garage to being a commercial scale facility.  It‚Äôs one of the reasons you won‚Äôt see too much aggressive marketing between 2016 and 2019.  Until we actually moved into the big facility in Aldersyde, people didn‚Äôt want to hear that we were ‚Äúalmost there‚Äù anymore.  If you look at GEVO‚Äôs history it‚Äôs similar. Their founder created the technology several years ago, the stock ran up on initial expectations, and then fell from grace.  It came back up once they actually got the commercialization scale questions answered, and they are off and running like we are (even slightly before us).We joke about us being an ‚Äúovernight success 16 years in the making‚Äù, but it‚Äôs not really that funny.  It was a long, frustrating and expensive path for Don and Cielo, where Don didn‚Äôt even take a personal salary for almost a decade. What we are seeing now, is thousands of followers instead of dozens, and thousands will soon become hundreds of thousands and hopefully millions.  Everyone wants to learn everything they can about the company, and will come across the 16 years of trials and tribulations.  If youtube had existing back in the 80‚Äôs, I often wonder how many videos of Steve Jobs declaring he has the best computer in the world built, years before that first apple actually came to life, would exist?  These days, with the instant access to media, people get to see all of these new technologies as they ‚Äúfail forward‚Äù, and all the real work that goes into getting to the finish line, and some see it as a cautionary tale when in reality its the way every great idea USUALLY gets there."More,Jaay,,47,0

last month,Some interesting reading on the market that Cielo is tapping into. IMO I feel that Cielo has a bright future, despite the fact that the world is transitioning into EV which will take a long time.The fact that Cielo wont rely on subsidiaries and the feedstock is cheaper in comparison to Bio Diesel mitigates a lot of risk to Cielo. Facilities are cheaper and quicker to build, no shortage of waste etc. Majority of renewable fuel is made from crops, where as Cielo is using garbage (Plastics, cardboard, timber, food waste etc) and providing a solution to our increasing landfill problems which is huge.If Cielo can implement its technology successfully and quickly this is going to be huge for us shareholders.https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/accenture-energy/renewable-diesel-frontier-fuel-futurehttps://www.futurebridge.com/industry/perspectives-energy/renewable-diesel-the-fuel-of-the-future/https://www.neste.com/journeytozerostories/archive/3577-renewable-solutions/future-diesel-free-7-hard-questions-about-diesel-biofuels-and-icesMore,Daniel,,3,1

last month,Any thoughts on this? Where do you see the SP consolidating at in the short term (next few months) after the most recent hype above $1? The commissioning of the expansion of its current facility is scheduled for Q1 2022. Commissioning of Dunmore scheduled for Q3 2022. There's still quite a bit of time to go before Cielo starts generating a decent amount of revenue from the facilities. Were expected to have 3 facilities operational by Q4 2022 (Aldersyde, Dumnore and Grande Prairie). Thanks!,Daniel,,0,0

last month,This will probably bounce between .95 and $1.15 for a while now.  But the company is amazing, and no doubting this will be in the double digits once they start rolling out.  6 weeks to build a plant, and 40 plants to be built, lots of forward progression to come!,BC,,8,1
last month,I like how shorts try or day traders who probably learned about this company 7 days ago because of a volume alert are trying to deter me from my investment.

I'm in far better position then they'll ever be at 7 cents the share, good luck trying to make money with a few pennies down when running the risk for this to reach true valuation of 8$ (based on 10 plants only when they are planning to open 40 in the next 5 years) now that 15 years of work is coming in fruitition,Carl,,17,1

last month,Anyone claiming this is a pump and dump clearly does not understand the potential of this company. At 1000l/hr and desulfurization occurring Cielo has multiple plants that will be built at NO cost to Cielo. Given their great margins, Cielo will be profitable from each plant taking 30% of profits until the plant is paid off (2-3yrs) followed by 50% of profits. Then scaleability of this technology is enormous and the application in underserved countries that rely on diesel for electricity is massive.,Matt,,9,0

last month,To all longs, just look at GEVO, they are still developing there technologies where as Cielo are done with developing there technology, just some optimization &amp; tweaks. GEVO is very limited in the ability to process all plastic and landfill waste, Cielo's technology can process all plastics and just about all landfill waste. Cielo's technology is far superior to GEVO but GEVO SP after hours today is US$10.22. Cielo SP is way undervalued and the next few weeks will be exciting for the longs.,Dan,,7,1

last month,I‚Äôm just glad a Canadian company is pushing forward to create what will be a process to correct some of the wrongs we‚Äôve done to our planet. If I lose some money so be it, at least there trying to do the right thing.,Alex,,14,1
last month,Booyah to all longs, the run on the SP is just starting and many are predicting an $8 target but after, a brief 10min discussion with Don Allan, I think that the near term SP could be as high as $12 to $15 and as for the long term projection, the skies the limit. I will explain why I am so upbeat about this company.After many attempts I finally managed to connect with Don for a quick discussion. (Note to all, this is just my interpretation of the content of our discussion. Up front Don indicated that he will not discuss the SP or get involved in any speculation of any kind and the focus of my questioning should be on the technology). So by now most longs have some understanding of the Cielo‚Äôs technologies and its potential to address the many challenges that all countries are wrestling with respect to waste management and its environmental impact. See attached link : https://www.facebook.com/cielows/videos/824536298089209/. Once Cielo &amp; their JV partners builds the 50 plants that they are projecting, this will be huge and when they start exporting their technologies out of Canada it with are MEGA for Cielo and it‚Äôs SP. This is all great but I think, at this point, Cielo will be just scratching the surface.Don in his road show interview briefly mentioned that Cielo is investigating the possibility of using their technology to convert human waste/poop into fuel. If Cielo can actually use their technology to actually convert human poop to fuel, Cielo will be the next TESLA. Municipalities using Cielo‚Äôs technology to convert their plastics and other garbage into fuel will not save these municipalities any money because all they are doing is redirect their garbage from the landfill to the Cielo plants, this is great for the environment and huge revenue for Cielo and partners but zero financial benefit for the municipalities.A wastewater treatment plant that treats human waste/poop requires huge capital investments, to build by the city/government and huge capital to run and maintain these facilities. So if Cielo can use their technology to treat human waste/poop, every city in every country will rush to adopt the Cielo technology which will kill two birds with one stone, i.e. convert the landfill garbage and human waste/poop into fuel. There will be no need for cities to build these expensive waste water treatment plants anymore and the cost of running and maintaining existing wastewater treatment plants will be drastically reduced.Don sees no reason why their existing technology cannot convert human waste into fuel and my suspicious is that fairly soon there will be some news from Cielo indicating that they will be starting trials to convert human waste/poop into fuel. He also indicated that there is huge interest from the Canada government and some international organisations in their technologies but will not elaborate.More,Dan,,13,1

last month,I have been in Gevo since the 3$ mark and AMTX since 3.50$.. currently Gevo has a market cap of about 1.7 B$ and are ramping up production ..I recently abandoned that position at 13.40$ and a M/C at nearly 2 B. The last fireside chat was not inspiring in terms of site selection and  production..My sense is they are awaiting a buy out ..AMTEX is now about the same valuation as this stock but with a app.15$ share price.. They also own a 20% share in a new EV startup launching shortly known as NERO motors..Given the comparisons and valuations, CMC would be a 5X from here to be comparable to GEVO and a SP of about 8$ CAD. as GEVO and AMTX are in USD.. AMTX using the same comparison will be 4.5 times its current SP , so at 75$ US per share..I will be in this through to the 4-5 $ area, as I am sure we will see some dilution (a must for development and expansion)  but, It is NO AMTX.. best to all and GL..More,TruthBurns,,3,0

That‚Äôs a max revenue of $14.6m (using $1.67/L from latest sale) for each of the next 2 years and that‚Äôs also being incredibly optimistic. We now have a market cap over $400m?!? I think we‚Äôll see a dramatic pullback very soon once people actually start doing some research and math on the actual time lines of this company‚Äôs revenue projections. It can‚Äôt sit at 100,000x price to sales for long. I think we might even see .40 again sometime this month at which point I‚Äôll gladly get back on the train.More,kyle,,5,1

last month,Obviously I realize this kind of run-up isn‚Äôt sustainable, but I do think that CMC was / is undervalued, and significant investors are beginning to take notice. If CMC can stay about $1 for 10 straight days, they may be able to start trading on the big markets. Once they‚Äôre on TSX, I think it‚Äôs reasonable to expect this stock to hit the $3-$4 range. A lot of people who buy high risk high reward stocks trade on platforms that CMC isn‚Äôt even available on, until it is traded on the bigger markets.,brennan,,5,1

I tend to monitor all of the investor channels, but don't jump into conversations a lot unless it's a direct question to me (and something I am able to answer, with publicly available information elsewhere).  I have a stronger presence on the CEO channel for most interactions, but obviously love seeing our presence grow across the globe on many channels.  My goal is to help provide information, but not be involved in the "buying and selling" talks, I'll leave that to all of you fine people! lol.

last month,Can CMC.cm recycle platics?Yes, while only 2 of 7 plastics are typically recyclable, Cielo can convert all 7 types of plastic. This is especially important as the plastic recycling business is in terrible shape. Asia is no longer taking our plastic waste from North America. Cielo‚Äôs business model is migrating to not only convert the plastic we have here in Canada and the US but also to become an importer of plastic waste.  In doing so, Cielo can clean up plastic waste from all affected countries and our world oceans.,John,,7,0

last month,Thanks Kyle-Essentially what this company does is take waste, put it through their process, and end up with renewable transportation diesel, jet fuel, and naphtha fuel. They can take almost any feedstock other than glass and metals, including wood, plastics, tires, construction waste, and municipal organic and solid waste.From their website -"All developed countries throughout the world require a minimum blend of renewable diesel be used in all transportation diesel fuel. Cielo‚Äôs renewable fuel can be used in highway, air, ocean, and railway sectors, and as a fuel in remote off-grid communities. Cielo's renewable naphtha will be used in the diluent, condensate and gasoline blending markets."They've been working on this process for 17 years and have gotten to the point at their main facility, where they are able to have the process creating 1000 litres per hour of renewable fuels. The site is operating 24 hours a day. As of right now, they have an agreement to take CP's old rail ties and are using that wood as the feedstock.At this main facility in Aldersyde, Alberta, they will be upgrading the plant this summer to expand the capacity to 2000 l/h. They have also ordered the equipment they'll need for the desulphurization of the fuels they produce. This will allow them to get a better price for the fuels and also allow them to be used in more applications. This is expected to be installed by end of Q1 2021.In November they signed a pre-sale commercial deal to sell 60,000 litres in anticipation of this desulphurization, at $1.25 per litre. Cielo's cost is between 0.45 - $0.75. They are able to achieve this low cost to create the diesel because they are getting the feedstock(wood, trash, etc) at such a low price. That's compared to biodiesel which uses expensive crops like canola, corn, etc.The great thing is that Cielo has a very effective, easily duplicated process now. They have agreements in place with Joint Venture partners to build another 5 facilities throughout Alberta. They are expected to break ground in Dunmore(Q2 21), Grand Prairie(Q4 21), Calgary and Edmonton(Q2 22). They have also purchased land in Medicine Hat, unsure when construction starts there. The CEO has stated he wants 40 facilities underway throughout North America in the next 5 years.For the Dunmore facility, the plan is to build it to allow for 12,000 litres per hour capacity or 100 million litres per year of high-grade renewable fuel. The CEO anticipates that they will convert 200,000 tonnes of garbage into fuel to meet these numbers per year.Cielo's process is patented in the USA and Canada. They have all municipal and Provincial permits in place with little Canadian competition. There are no major renewable diesel producers in Canada that can sell to this market.There is an active group on CEO.ca where one of Cielo's board members, Lionel Robbins, frequently visits. He is a wealth of information and is very accessible to anyone with questions. I'd recommend anyone interested to go through his old posts where he covers pretty much everything. Here's his post history link:https://ceo.ca/@lionelAs far as how the Joint Ventures work with Cielo, the JV partners are responsible for putting up 100% of the initial funds to build the facilities. Here's how the numbers work out, per Lionel:"@Lionel - Good morning everyone. I have seen quite a bit of information with regards to Cielo's revenue share on JV's, short term cash flow, etc, so I just wanted to put out a bit of information from the MOU's and some previous PR's, to summarize... u/r.p.56 has most of the information correct here in terms of the JV agreements between RenewableU/Cielo, Seymour/Cielo and any follow-on JV's. The JV partner is responsible for sourcing 100% of the funds to build and commission the new facility, and then will receive 70% of the profits per year until they receive the equivalent of that build cost back, with Cielo getting the other 30%. Once the cap cost recovery is complete, Cielo will then receive 50.1% of the profits going forward, with the JV partner getting the other 49.9% That gives Cielo some significant cash flow even during the cap cost return phase, as they will have no debt involved in the project. In terms of the estimated 24 month period to build, Cielo has positive cash flow at that point as well, receiving 7% of the cap cost to manage the builds. They would receive the 7% as the build draws are taken, giving them some consistent cash flow throughout the 24 months before the plants actually fire up. With most of the JV projects estimated to cost in the $50M to $80M range (depending on initial volume planned), 7% on several JV's is not a small number for Cielo to see in their pockets while waiting for the cash flow from operations. Cielo will also be ramping up to the last phase of Aldersyde during that time, to produce 2000 LPH and have its own sales revenue for additional cash flow."Here's some more info from Lionel onMore,John,,6,1

last month,About Cielo Waste Solutions(CSE:CMC, OTCQB:CWSFF)Cielo Waste Solutions is a Canadian waste to energy company with a proprietary technology engineered to help solve the world‚Äôs garbage crisis. The Company‚Äôs technology transforms landfill garbage into renewable diesel, kerosene and naphtha fuels at a significantly lower cost than biofuel companies. The feedstock used in the Company‚Äôs green refineries is the world‚Äôs most available and inexpensive feedstock ‚Äì garbage; including household, commercial/construction/demolition garbage, used tires, railway ties, as well as all types of plastic that currently cannot be recycled. Cielo holds the exclusive global rights to its thermal catalytic depolymerization technology of which has been reviewed by recognized 3rd party engineers and is patented in the USA and Canada. Cielo‚Äôs first commercial renewable diesel refinery in Aldersyde, Alberta, has output capacity now projected to be ~500-1,000 liters per hour once continuous-flow is achieved. Cielo‚Äôs cost of producing renewable diesel at its Green Facility has been between C$0.45-$0.75 while the sale price in Edmonton for diesel, as of February 2021 was C$1.63 per liter, implying a strong margin. Cielo is targeted to become Canada‚Äôs first producer of renewable diesel that is fully compatible with federal and provincial-mandated fuels regulations. Cielo has already begun expanding its footprint by signing multiple Memorandums of Understanding pursuant to which third parties are in negotiation with Cielo to build, at no cost to Cielo, Joint Venture Renewable Diesel Facilities in Grande Prairie, Calgary, Medicine Hat and Lethbridge, Alberta as well as in Nova Scotia. Cielo will be the general contractor and operator of all the proposed JV Facilities. Altogether, the five green facilities will divert ~128,000 tonnes of waste per year from Canada‚Äôs landfills. To put this in context, Canada currently generates ~31-million tonnes of garbage per year and the world produces over 2 billion tonnes of waste per yearMore,Joseph,,7,0

2 months ago,They spent 16 years of researching and $80m to get to this stage. Turning garbage into high grade diesel and kerosene: transportation fuelWith international patents, Cielo has a unique solution for 2 major problems: 1.) Landfills give off harmful emissions2.) Governments are raising mandates for what % of gas must be renewableWay cheaper product than all competitors... Most biofuel use soybeans, corn, vegetable oil as feedstock. Feedstock is material distilled that turns into fuel. Since Cielo‚Äôs feedstock is garbage, their cost is very little.Low valuation = huge upside Entire company is only valued ~ $55mThis is most likely a result of not showing revenue for 16 years but game changing technology takes time.$GEVO is a comparable who uses corn as feedstock (more expensive). They are worth $1.8B and growing. That‚Äôs 60x the size of Cielo.$CWSFF product is cheaper &amp; has an additional environmental impact of reducing the methane from landfills.Allan said they are opening 40 facilities within 5 years. Each facility produces 24,000 liters/day With only 10 facilities, he said ‚Äúthe stock can go to a few dollars‚Äù Currently @ $0.1010-20 facilities in 2-3 years is reasonableIf $CWSFF achieves their goal of 40 facilities they can justify a billion dollar valuation $5b is ~100x in 5 yearsThey have one facility currently open, 5 more opening and will announce more later this yearReduce up to 5.2B pounds of garbage a yearCielo just had their first preorder in November 2020 of 60,000 liters for $1.25/literThey are finally able to efficiently produce &amp; are attempting to sell their product now: there‚Äôs a lot of potential catalystsMore,D,,16,0

2 months ago,Here are my thoughts. I think Cielo is an interesting long term play, especially if they can produce 1000L/day and remove sulfur from their fuel. In the near term I suspect they‚Äôll pull back around 0.15 because of how their warrants are structured. Having said that, often times, companies like to release news at the same time to offset people calling in warrants (look at SOS last week).

2 months ago,For those who don't follow this or are new, this company has incredible potential. There have been non stop hiccups and changes that have resulted in this project not being able to fully realize it's potential. What they do is nothing short of extraordinary and the potential for global adoption is mind blowing. All types of plastics and any garbage can be efficiently converted to high grade diesel. They will not require any government subsidies to remain profitable. Their material accuisition costs can be negative due to the nature of the feedstock, i.e garbage. The quality of the diesel produced will demand a premium market price. The design for the facility is modular and once fully realized will be able to commission new facilities in as little as 6 months. I think the figure was $50 million per facility.Cielo is already looking to commission a second plant of its own while also joint venturing multiple facilities with Renewable U Energy. The joint ventures benefit Cielo immediately and indefinitely, while providing revenue with no upfront debt. Win win for cmc.The hope is that the first facility (Aldersyde,AB) is able to meet the production quotas. Namely, 1000L per hour. Once everything is in place the design will be replicated at the remaining facilities. Still have the desulfurization process to finalize but would appear it's in the final stages.This has been a long ride. Seen this go to $0.30 all the way down to $0.03, maybe lower but stopped watching. Up almost 100% but not selling. This will go national, then international. For the diamond hands that can hold, once it hits the TSE....BOOM.More,Andrew,,12,0

6 months ago,While Cielo's initial goal was to start the Facility slowly after the latest improvements, with expectations between 200 to 500 liters per hour, the Facility produced 800 liters per hour of distillate. After approximately four hours of continuous operation, Cielo scaled back production to allow its engineers the opportunity to analyze any maintenance or functional concerns at that level. Cielo plans to be back up to 800 liters per hour of continuous flow as early as next week following minor tweaks by the engineers and 1,000 liters per hour shortly thereafter. Additional updates on the production volumes will be discussed in the live webinar on Thursday, October 22nd at 11 am ET (webinar details provided below).
