53 minutes ago,Good morning everyone!  I just wanted to jump in and introduce myself.  My name is Lionel Robins, and I am a board member of Cielo but also their Investor Relations for Canada.  I tend to monitor all of the investor channels, but don't jump into conversations a lot unless it's a direct question to me (and something I am able to answer, with publicly available information elsewhere).  I have a stronger presence on the CEO channel for most interactions, but obviously love seeing our presence grow across the globe on many channels.  My goal is to help provide information, but not be involved in the "buying and selling" talks, I'll leave that to all of you fine people! lol.  We at Cielo are excited from all the recent attention, and looking forward to the years to come.More,Lionel,,5,0

yesterday,Can CMC.cm recycle platics?Yes, while only 2 of 7 plastics are typically recyclable, Cielo can convert all 7 types of plastic. This is especially important as the plastic recycling business is in terrible shape. Asia is no longer taking our plastic waste from North America. Cielo‚Äôs business model is migrating to not only convert the plastic we have here in Canada and the US but also to become an importer of plastic waste.  In doing so, Cielo can clean up plastic waste from all affected countries and our world oceans.,John,,6,0

2 days ago,Not bashing cmc, have followed for 1.5 years and been invested since 0.08.... sold today on the hype at 0.90.... fantastic.Issue is the revenue and R&amp;D stages currently. Cmc will require more cash so further dilution will occur especially at today‚Äôs prices, or anything above 0.20... I expect that this will be dumped this week. Be very careful and only invest what you can afford to lose. Shorts will attack it (if they didn‚Äôt load already today) and dilution is imminent.Good luck to anyone playing this stock.

2 days ago,Thanks Kyle-Essentially what this company does is take waste, put it through their process, and end up with renewable transportation diesel, jet fuel, and naphtha fuel. They can take almost any feedstock other than glass and metals, including wood, plastics, tires, construction waste, and municipal organic and solid waste.From their website -"All developed countries throughout the world require a minimum blend of renewable diesel be used in all transportation diesel fuel. Cielo‚Äôs renewable fuel can be used in highway, air, ocean, and railway sectors, and as a fuel in remote off-grid communities. Cielo's renewable naphtha will be used in the diluent, condensate and gasoline blending markets."They've been working on this process for 17 years and have gotten to the point at their main facility, where they are able to have the process creating 1000 litres per hour of renewable fuels. The site is operating 24 hours a day. As of right now, they have an agreement to take CP's old rail ties and are using that wood as the feedstock.At this main facility in Aldersyde, Alberta, they will be upgrading the plant this summer to expand the capacity to 2000 l/h. They have also ordered the equipment they'll need for the desulphurization of the fuels they produce. This will allow them to get a better price for the fuels and also allow them to be used in more applications. This is expected to be installed by end of Q1 2021.In November they signed a pre-sale commercial deal to sell 60,000 litres in anticipation of this desulphurization, at $1.25 per litre. Cielo's cost is between 0.45 - $0.75. They are able to achieve this low cost to create the diesel because they are getting the feedstock(wood, trash, etc) at such a low price. That's compared to biodiesel which uses expensive crops like canola, corn, etc.The great thing is that Cielo has a very effective, easily duplicated process now. They have agreements in place with Joint Venture partners to build another 5 facilities throughout Alberta. They are expected to break ground in Dunmore(Q2 21), Grand Prairie(Q4 21), Calgary and Edmonton(Q2 22). They have also purchased land in Medicine Hat, unsure when construction starts there. The CEO has stated he wants 40 facilities underway throughout North America in the next 5 years.For the Dunmore facility, the plan is to build it to allow for 12,000 litres per hour capacity or 100 million litres per year of high-grade renewable fuel. The CEO anticipates that they will convert 200,000 tonnes of garbage into fuel to meet these numbers per year.Cielo's process is patented in the USA and Canada. They have all municipal and Provincial permits in place with little Canadian competition. There are no major renewable diesel producers in Canada that can sell to this market.There is an active group on CEO.ca where one of Cielo's board members, Lionel Robbins, frequently visits. He is a wealth of information and is very accessible to anyone with questions. I'd recommend anyone interested to go through his old posts where he covers pretty much everything. Here's his post history link:https://ceo.ca/@lionelAs far as how the Joint Ventures work with Cielo, the JV partners are responsible for putting up 100% of the initial funds to build the facilities. Here's how the numbers work out, per Lionel:"@Lionel - Good morning everyone. I have seen quite a bit of information with regards to Cielo's revenue share on JV's, short term cash flow, etc, so I just wanted to put out a bit of information from the MOU's and some previous PR's, to summarize... u/r.p.56 has most of the information correct here in terms of the JV agreements between RenewableU/Cielo, Seymour/Cielo and any follow-on JV's. The JV partner is responsible for sourcing 100% of the funds to build and commission the new facility, and then will receive 70% of the profits per year until they receive the equivalent of that build cost back, with Cielo getting the other 30%. Once the cap cost recovery is complete, Cielo will then receive 50.1% of the profits going forward, with the JV partner getting the other 49.9% That gives Cielo some significant cash flow even during the cap cost return phase, as they will have no debt involved in the project. In terms of the estimated 24 month period to build, Cielo has positive cash flow at that point as well, receiving 7% of the cap cost to manage the builds. They would receive the 7% as the build draws are taken, giving them some consistent cash flow throughout the 24 months before the plants actually fire up. With most of the JV projects estimated to cost in the $50M to $80M range (depending on initial volume planned), 7% on several JV's is not a small number for Cielo to see in their pockets while waiting for the cash flow from operations. Cielo will also be ramping up to the last phase of Aldersyde during that time, to produce 2000 LPH and have its own sales revenue for additional cash flow."Here's some more info from Lionel onMore,John,,6,1

CIELO will be the general contractor and operator of all the proposed JV Facilities. The feedstock that will be used in the Company's green facilities is the world's most available and inexpensive feedstock - garbage; including household, commercial/ construction/demolition garbage, used tires, railway ties and telephone poles as well as all types of plastic that currently cannot be recycled."At no cost toMore,John,,4,1

We can't help wondering why it's publicly listed so early in its journey. Are venture capitalists not interested? So it seems shareholders are too busy dreaming about the progress to come than dwelling on the current (lack of) revenue.

3 days ago,About Cielo Waste Solutions(CSE:CMC, OTCQB:CWSFF)Cielo Waste Solutions is a Canadian waste to energy company with a proprietary technology engineered to help solve the world‚Äôs garbage crisis. The Company‚Äôs technology transforms landfill garbage into renewable diesel, kerosene and naphtha fuels at a significantly lower cost than biofuel companies. The feedstock used in the Company‚Äôs green refineries is the world‚Äôs most available and inexpensive feedstock ‚Äì garbage; including household, commercial/construction/demolition garbage, used tires, railway ties, as well as all types of plastic that currently cannot be recycled. Cielo holds the exclusive global rights to its thermal catalytic depolymerization technology of which has been reviewed by recognized 3rd party engineers and is patented in the USA and Canada. Cielo‚Äôs first commercial renewable diesel refinery in Aldersyde, Alberta, has output capacity now projected to be ~500-1,000 liters per hour once continuous-flow is achieved. Cielo‚Äôs cost of producing renewable diesel at its Green Facility has been between C$0.45-$0.75 while the sale price in Edmonton for diesel, as of February 2021 was C$1.63 per liter, implying a strong margin. Cielo is targeted to become Canada‚Äôs first producer of renewable diesel that is fully compatible with federal and provincial-mandated fuels regulations. Cielo has already begun expanding its footprint by signing multiple Memorandums of Understanding pursuant to which third parties are in negotiation with Cielo to build, at no cost to Cielo, Joint Venture Renewable Diesel Facilities in Grande Prairie, Calgary, Medicine Hat and Lethbridge, Alberta as well as in Nova Scotia. Cielo will be the general contractor and operator of all the proposed JV Facilities. Altogether, the five green facilities will divert ~128,000 tonnes of waste per year from Canada‚Äôs landfills. To put this in context, Canada currently generates ~31-million tonnes of garbage per year and the world produces over 2 billion tonnes of waste per yearMore,Joseph,,7,0

16 days ago,They spent 16 years of researching and $80m to get to this stage. Turning garbage into high grade diesel and kerosene: transportation fuelWith international patents, Cielo has a unique solution for 2 major problems: 1.) Landfills give off harmful emissions2.) Governments are raising mandates for what % of gas must be renewableWay cheaper product than all competitors... Most biofuel use soybeans, corn, vegetable oil as feedstock. Feedstock is material distilled that turns into fuel. Since Cielo‚Äôs feedstock is garbage, their cost is very little.Low valuation = huge upside Entire company is only valued ~ $55mThis is most likely a result of not showing revenue for 16 years but game changing technology takes time.$GEVO is a comparable who uses corn as feedstock (more expensive). They are worth $1.8B and growing. That‚Äôs 60x the size of Cielo.$CWSFF product is cheaper &amp; has an additional environmental impact of reducing the methane from landfills.Allan said they are opening 40 facilities within 5 years. Each facility produces 24,000 liters/day With only 10 facilities, he said ‚Äúthe stock can go to a few dollars‚Äù Currently @ $0.1010-20 facilities in 2-3 years is reasonableIf $CWSFF achieves their goal of 40 facilities they can justify a billion dollar valuation $5b is ~100x in 5 yearsThey have one facility currently open, 5 more opening and will announce more later this yearReduce up to 5.2B pounds of garbage a yearCielo just had their first preorder in November 2020 of 60,000 liters for $1.25/literThey are finally able to efficiently produce &amp; are attempting to sell their product now: there‚Äôs a lot of potential catalystsMore,D,,16,0

17 days ago,Here are my thoughts. I think Cielo is an interesting long term play, especially if they can produce 1000L/day and remove sulfur from their fuel.

Having said that, often times, companies like to release news at the same time to offset people calling in warrants (look at SOS last week).

20 days ago,For those who don't follow this or are new, this company has incredible potential. There have been non stop hiccups and changes that have resulted in this project not being able to fully realize it's potential. What they do is nothing short of extraordinary and the potential for global adoption is mind blowing. All types of plastics and any garbage can be efficiently converted to high grade diesel. They will not require any government subsidies to remain profitable. Their material accuisition costs can be negative due to the nature of the feedstock, i.e garbage. The quality of the diesel produced will demand a premium market price. The design for the facility is modular and once fully realized will be able to commission new facilities in as little as 6 months. I think the figure was $50 million per facility.Cielo is already looking to commission a second plant of its own while also joint venturing multiple facilities with Renewable U Energy. The joint ventures benefit Cielo immediately and indefinitely, while providing revenue with no upfront debt. Win win for cmc.The hope is that the first facility (Aldersyde,AB) is able to meet the production quotas. Namely, 1000L per hour. Once everything is in place the design will be replicated at the remaining facilities. Still have the desulfurization process to finalize but would appear it's in the final stages.This has been a long ride. Seen this go to $0.30 all the way down to $0.03, maybe lower but stopped watching. Up almost 100% but not selling. This will go national, then international. For the diamond hands that can hold, once it hits the TSE....BOOM.More,Andrew,,12,0

4 months ago,Apparently the CEO of cielo ,  also had another company in the past , cielio Gold , no longer around , millions gone ,   And I wonder why he himself does the yearly finanaces,  and not a certified accountant and numbers not yet verified ?,michael,,2,0
4 months ago,Well here we are seven years later , and company says producing 800 litres per hour, Right now at suncor fuel terminal kamloops b.c litre of bio diesal fuel wholesale is .57 cents/litre .  so company making approx  800 litres x 16 hours x.57 cents $7296 bucks a day , not a huge return so far , after seven years, with wages and a 75 million dollar plant , lawyers consultants maintenance etc , only money in this stock for foreseeable future is for a day trader, or a short ,  longs have to be very patient unfortunatley,michael,,2,4
4 months ago,800lh is very very close to 1000lh great things to come thats for sure very scalable company with innovative technology very impressed myself, inventions don't build themselves and changing the world doesn't happen over night but anything can happen in the next year :),Dale,,1,0

4 months ago,Screw money and personal greed the world needs stronger minded souls to clean up the mess we have made for decades, forget what cash you might make and forget your one way of thinking of lining your pockets and put some effort towards cleaning up the world no different then when you throw a huge party at your house someone will have to clean the mess, the world is our stage and we are tripping over the trash we all made so put your faith into this garbage eating machine we all need.,Dale,,3,0
4 months ago,Like they say buy on rumours, sell on news ,   You can produce as many litres as you want per hour ,  but is it cost efficient, what is the octane of fuel produced,   And how much is market paying per litre wholesale,  who is the customer?    Non of these issues addressed.  Also , have not figured out how to de-sulferize the fuel so far ,  so long ways to go will be a bumpy road ,  and internal stock buying and selling certainly a means of raising capital for the company, do your d/d  be patient,michael,,1,1

4 months ago,I like the CEO of this company. I can read people well and he seems entirely transparent about everything. This is why I believe this truly will rise up once people get to know what‚Äôs going on,Carl,,1,0
4 months ago,Did I not read somewhere or hear that the target was 2000 litres/hour?,RVH,,0,0
5 months ago,While Cielo's initial goal was to start the Facility slowly after the latest improvements, with expectations between 200 to 500 liters per hour, the Facility produced 800 liters per hour of distillate. After approximately four hours of continuous operation, Cielo scaled back production to allow its engineers the opportunity to analyze any maintenance or functional concerns at that level. Cielo plans to be back up to 800 liters per hour of continuous flow as early as next week following minor tweaks by the engineers and 1,000 liters per hour shortly thereafter. Additional updates on the production volumes will be discussed in the live webinar on Thursday, October 22nd at 11 am ET (webinar details provided below). With the Facility producing continuously, to management's knowledge, Cielo is now the first company to convert multiple waste streams (garbage) into renewable diesel, naphtha and kerosene (jet &amp; marine fuels).More,Brett,,2,0

5 months ago,This should mean any day now. In their interview, they did say that the reason it was not climbing yet is that "everybody is waiting for us to announce that we are in positive revenue, we should see that by fall" They also answered in response for stock price forecast that they are planning to open up 40 plants in the next five years and that only 10 plants is enough to have the stock sitting at 10$. What i like about the interview is that the CEO doesn't seem like a Bull shytter, lol sorry for my typos it's for yahoo to allow the word on my post,Carl,,3,0
5 months ago,Cielo is relying on exemptive relief recently granted by Canadian securities regulatory authorities that allows it to delay the filing of its annual documents required by National Instrument 51-102 by August 28, 2020. In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, securities regulatory authorities in Canada have granted a blanket exemption allowing issuers an additional 45 days to complete their regulatory filings. Accordingly, the British Columbia Securities Commission ("BCSC") has enacted BC Instrument 51-517 - Temporary Exemption from Certain Corporate Finance Requirements ("BCI 51-517").Cielo estimates that the Annual Filings will be available for filing on or before September 20, 2020.More,Carl,,0,0
