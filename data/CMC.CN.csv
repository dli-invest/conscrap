8 hours ago,This company is a local for me. they seem to have a great idea to long term problem and just announced that they are expanding operations. I have held stock for over a year and bought around where it is now. I have been waiting for it to come back and I am happy to see it is rebounding. It deserves recognition.,S,,1,0

3 months ago,Apparently the CEO of cielo ,  also had another company in the past , cielio Gold , no longer around , millions gone ,   And I wonder why he himself does the yearly finanaces,  and not a certified accountant and numbers not yet verified ?,michael,,1,0
3 months ago,Well here we are seven years later , and company says producing 800 litres per hour, Right now at suncor fuel terminal kamloops b.c litre of bio diesal fuel wholesale is .57 cents/litre .  so company making approx  800 litres x 16 hours x.57 cents $7296 bucks a day , not a huge return so far , after seven years, with wages and a 75 million dollar plant , lawyers consultants maintenance etc , only money in this stock for foreseeable future is for a day trader, or a short ,  longs have to be very patient unfortunatley,michael,,2,4
3 months ago,800lh is very very close to 1000lh great things to come thats for sure very scalable company with innovative technology very impressed myself, inventions don't build themselves and changing the world doesn't happen over night but anything can happen in the next year :),Dale,,1,0

3 months ago,Screw money and personal greed the world needs stronger minded souls to clean up the mess we have made for decades, forget what cash you might make and forget your one way of thinking of lining your pockets and put some effort towards cleaning up the world no different then when you throw a huge party at your house someone will have to clean the mess, the world is our stage and we are tripping over the trash we all made so put your faith into this garbage eating machine we all need.,Dale,,3,0
3 months ago,Like they say buy on rumours, sell on news ,   You can produce as many litres as you want per hour ,  but is it cost efficient, what is the octane of fuel produced,   And how much is market paying per litre wholesale,  who is the customer?    Non of these issues addressed.  Also , have not figured out how to de-sulferize the fuel so far ,  so long ways to go will be a bumpy road ,  and internal stock buying and selling certainly a means of raising capital for the company, do your d/d  be patient,michael,,1,1

3 months ago,I like the CEO of this company. I can read people well and he seems entirely transparent about everything. This is why I believe this truly will rise up once people get to know what’s going on,Carl,,1,0
3 months ago,Did I not read somewhere or hear that the target was 2000 litres/hour?,RVH,,0,0
3 months ago,While Cielo's initial goal was to start the Facility slowly after the latest improvements, with expectations between 200 to 500 liters per hour, the Facility produced 800 liters per hour of distillate. After approximately four hours of continuous operation, Cielo scaled back production to allow its engineers the opportunity to analyze any maintenance or functional concerns at that level. Cielo plans to be back up to 800 liters per hour of continuous flow as early as next week following minor tweaks by the engineers and 1,000 liters per hour shortly thereafter. Additional updates on the production volumes will be discussed in the live webinar on Thursday, October 22nd at 11 am ET (webinar details provided below). With the Facility producing continuously, to management's knowledge, Cielo is now the first company to convert multiple waste streams (garbage) into renewable diesel, naphtha and kerosene (jet &amp; marine fuels).More,Brett,,2,0

4 months ago,This should mean any day now. In their interview, they did say that the reason it was not climbing yet is that "everybody is waiting for us to announce that we are in positive revenue, we should see that by fall" They also answered in response for stock price forecast that they are planning to open up 40 plants in the next five years and that only 10 plants is enough to have the stock sitting at 10$. What i like about the interview is that the CEO doesn't seem like a Bull shytter, lol sorry for my typos it's for yahoo to allow the word on my post,Carl,,3,0
4 months ago,Cielo is relying on exemptive relief recently granted by Canadian securities regulatory authorities that allows it to delay the filing of its annual documents required by National Instrument 51-102 by August 28, 2020. In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, securities regulatory authorities in Canada have granted a blanket exemption allowing issuers an additional 45 days to complete their regulatory filings. Accordingly, the British Columbia Securities Commission ("BCSC") has enacted BC Instrument 51-517 - Temporary Exemption from Certain Corporate Finance Requirements ("BCI 51-517").Cielo estimates that the Annual Filings will be available for filing on or before September 20, 2020.More,Carl,,0,0
