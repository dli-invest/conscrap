1 hour ago,Hurricane Ida is causing shortages of diluent that oil companies use for blending heavy oil to transport it. Today, Aduro is presenting their water based technology which solves that problem AND is more cost effective than buying diluent. I expect licensing or partnership with a big oil company in the near future. Huge upside potential here.,Meowzer,,0,0
