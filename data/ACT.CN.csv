6 months ago,Definitely a game changer stock, I wouldn't expect a moon launch until their r&amp;d is done and they're licensing off their technology. I'm wondering if they have a plan to turn plastics into renewable chemicals or are they just focused on licensing off all their tech later on.,Heavens Gate Trading,,3,1

last year,Hurricane Ida is causing shortages of diluent that oil companies use for blending heavy oil to transport it. Today, Aduro is presenting their water based technology which solves that problem AND is more cost effective than buying diluent. I expect licensing or partnership with a big oil company in the near future. Huge upside potential here.,Buff,,5,0
