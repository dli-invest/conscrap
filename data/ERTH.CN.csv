18 days ago,Came across this  while reading the closing "The Company granted the Agents an option (the ‚ÄúOver-Allotment Option‚Äù) to sell up to an additional 15% of the Units sold under the Offering. The Over-Allotment Option may be exercised in whole or in part, to acquire Units at the Issue Price, or Unit Shares at a price of $0.198 per Unit Share or Unit Warrants at a price of $0.052 per Unit Warrant, as determined Agents upon written notice to the Company at any time up to 30 days following the closing date of the Offering."pp closed june 21 so I believe july 21 will be when this selling pressure stops ( aside from market chaos). so possibly some cheap papers causing this downward pressure. Just accumulate at a low price to get bang for buck. Cash makes up more then 50% of ERTH's market cap . People need to eat and our product sells out, so recession or not i don't see this slowing down at all.More,Adrian,,4,0

6 months ago,@serioustoday closest comparibles would be XBC and GRN and you will quickly see how undervalued this is from a p/s pov. Considering their expected growth rate and expected to have positive earnings on q4. XBC net income is atrocious yet their p/s remain above 3. GRN atleast reported neutral earnings last quarter and is trading at a p/s of 3.77. So I personally believe ERTH should atleast have a marketcap of 50m , bringing us above 0.5.If we share the same ps valuation as GRN, then 3.77*15.1= 57m marketcap , which means 0.6 is not out of the question in the near term. In addition our expected annual rev for next year is 24 m. assuming we share the same ps valuation as GRN the marketcap should bring this to 90m, we have the Bethune project to look forward to the year after that.More,Adrian,,2,4

9 months ago,becoming disappointed in mgmt.  Their ability to execute business plan and lack of transparency is concerning.  seem to be more involved with compensating themselves than keeping investors informed.  the level of stock dumping at these prices could be a bad indicator.  I strongly believe in their concepts, but not their execution.  made inquiry regarding qtrly results release date, but no response.,bills,,2,0

11 months ago,So I looked at an old financial that ended june 30,2019 and apparently there were a bunch of options expiring around this time.  4million exercisable @ 0.25-expires july 18,2021, and 1.25million @0.14 - expires aug 22, 2021 that likely contributing to the selling pressure lately.,Adrian,,2,0
11 months ago,Pretty decent growth here. I'm holding long and adding.,Naveed,,2,0
11 months ago,I checked the insider INK page on May28 and I believe the seller was from an insider who held 10% of the float at one point as he was included in the insider list  with 3.77m common share only to disappear the next , indicating that he fell below the 10% threshold from selling.  Since july 16 anon has sold 2.7 since then. The seller is likely Stan Bharti founder of ForbesManhatten which holds a portfolio of other companies. The selling may be related to the financing that was announced today on another company called MEDV (stay away), which is expected to close on aug 27, so I hope i'm right in believing that the selling should stop once this pp with medv closes. Overall I am glad that the number of shares he holds is getting less. He still does have options at 0.25, which expired july17 , but not entirely sure on his warrants, likely above 0.3.More,Adrian,,1,0
11 months ago,Loaded here stupid cheap,Jack,,0,0
11 months ago,There is a theory that the relentless selling at 0.25 is related to the debt settlement of 2.2 million shares.

last year,Crypto deal, check!. Replenish deal, check! Next up the Colorado deal!,BroReal_frOst,,3,0
last year,I had a look at their investors presentation from March. With the acquisition of 'Replenish' they predict a revenue of 9.9million in 2021, 10.5 million in 2022 and 11.7 million in 2023. On top of that they expect earnings between 4.4 and 6.6 million from their stand alone facility. These are the revenues from their main product (organic fertilizer). Earnings from their electricity generation is expected to be 1.3 million for 2021. This means a revenue around 16 million in 2021 and going up for the years after that. Their market cap is 16.7 million at the moment. This would mean they almost have their market cap in earnings of 1 year! Compare this to other countries: e.g. Apple would need more than 7 years to get their market cap in earnings. Very bullish about this one... Volume will go up once more people get to know the company!More,niels,,0,0

2 years ago,I went through the investor presentation on their website and it looks like they've got a well-structured plan in place over the next year.  Lots of milestones to meet but on track so far.,Peter,,2,0
2 years ago,This one is just going to take a while to play out, plain and simple.   We are looking at more of a 2021-2022 story for any results I think.  The test results look good and they have a solid plan, but it is going to take time for them to build the equipment to scale for any meaningful revenue.  I just hope they don't fall into the trap of other companies in this space and move too slowly to take advantage of the market before either a paradigm shift, stronger/faster competitor, or recession comes along.   I was in a company called Intrepid Natural Resources back in 2006-2007 that was building out biogas anaerobic digestors in Idaho at dairies.  They used the manure and waste dairy product to create biogas for sale into the grid, took the water stream from the manure to use for irrigation, and the solids were converted to bio peatmoss for nurseries and other horticultural use.  Amazing company, sky high natural gas prices supporting the momentum.  But they moved too slowly to capture the market.  Natural gas prices collapses, the recession hit, and fracking led to a paradigm shift that ruined the market for years.  Now, big utilities are the ones controlling the space through renewal methane projects (look to Duke energy and others around pig/chicken manure usage).  They need to make sure they are moving quickly enough to get a recurring revenue stream that ensures survivability, but slowly enough to not overspend on projects and overreach.  I just hope they can find and maintain that balance. -DanMore,DanH,,7,0
2 years ago,So preliminary results look good, looks like they will partner w/ the large US feedlot.  That, of course, will bring in more revenue but, more importantly, should open the doors for more deals in the US.  I think this is just the start for this innovative company.,Peter,,4,0
2 years ago,Is anyone aware of the huge discrepancy b/t the Canadian stock market price of EarthRenew (ERTH.CN) and the US market price (VVIVF).
