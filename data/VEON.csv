2 months ago,WELL DONE!Commenting on results, Kaan Terzioglu said:"The 1Q22 financial statements published today further reinforce VEON Group's strong underlying performance driven by the successful implementation of our digital operator strategy across all our geographies, where we continue to deliver vital connectivity and digital services. Net profit before impairments rose by 168% YoY, while cash from operating activities of USD 565 million demonstrates the high resilience of our business even in difficult times. Our 1Q22 results, together with our strong performance in April and May, show VEON's ongoing and effective operational and financial discipline, as well as the progress we continue to make delivering on our strategy."1Q22 Financial StatementsFollowing the 1Q22 trading update on 28 April 2022, VEON today reports the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for 1Q22.

2 months ago,An excerpt from CEO, Mr. Muhterem Kaan Terziogh'sletter to investors:üí† Approximately USD 2.4 billion, including USD 1.8 billion equivalent of USD- and EUR-denominated cash and deposits held by the headquarters in Amsterdam. This was achieved after we further enhanced VEON Group's cash position by increasing our current revolving credit facility utilization to USD 973 million, as announced on 25 May 2022. As stated previously, we do not have any material debt maturing in 2022.~In addition to HQ-level liquidity, the self-sufficient nature of our operating companies in terms of financing was again highlighted recently. Jazz in Pakistan and Banglalink in Bangladesh have successfully raised local long-term funding to cover their spectrum requirements, with 10-year PKR 40 billion (c. USD 222 million) and 5-year BDT 12 billion (c. USD 135 million) loans, respectively. We have also made material progress in the simplification of our capital structure. As communicated on 21 April 2022, a total of RUB 90 billion in loans were novated to PJSC VimpelCom, with the former borrower (VEON Finance Ireland) and the former guarantor (VEON Holdings BV) having been released. This transaction aligned ruble liabilities with ruble revenues and reduced HQ external debt. We are also working on rationalizing VEON Group's ownership structure of Beeline Kazakhstan.More,David,,4,0

Russia has also been partially kicked out of SWIFT so it may be hard to send money from Russia to VEON.  This might explain why VEON has been going down so much.  I think it's way too risky since I doubt expenses will be cut in half to offset the lack of revenue.  Want more proof?  Just check out VEON HOLDINGS Bonds.  They literally collapsed.,Marc A,,2,11

11 months ago,i see a lot of question marks here, üòÇüòÇ guys let's recap the facts: 30th june 1.2 bn $ cash on hand + 1.6 bn available with various tools. Sold some passive Infrastructur in Russia + 0.97 bn, Algeria Business for sale, the goodwill on the balance sheet is over 1 bn for Algeria, so + 1bn. Gives us veoniers aprox. 3.2bn $ cash on hand üôãüòÇ but we will lose roundabout 350 mil. ebitda because of this deals, i project a ebitda of 3.3 bn for 2022. But they can repay some debts with 8.7%, 8.6%, 8.35% interest rates, net debt will fall to under 5bn (excl. lease debts) so net debt ratio aprox. 1.5x, they use the equity FCF to measure there pay out. For now in 2021 the invest almost all money (pakistan 275 mil. for 25%, 115 mil. bangladesh for spectrum license, adtech in russia, network improvement in all markets) so until now not much room for dividends, dividend or not the value of veon is growing quick, look at all the investments, they transfer the company to an important TecPlayer üòéüòÄMore,Thomas,,0,0

Unless I misunderstood the wording in their 2nd quarter report, I think it should read as no dividend for the (rest) of FY 2020.When they can afford to restart the dividend depends on their cash flow performance.  No guarantees but maybe some time in 2021.---------------------Below from Page 7 of their 2Q2020 Report dated 08/06/2020:"Regarding dividends, our policy remains as previously disclosed: to pay at least 50% of EFCF after licenses while maintaining Net Debt/LTM EBITDA at around 2.0x and taking into account medium-term investment opportunities. Cash flows generated in the first half of 2020 were weaker compared to last year. Given that in the second half we may potentially face a number of uncertainties, we currently believe it is unlikely that we will pay a dividend for FY 2020."---------------------------More,John-John,,4,0

3 years ago,From today's earnings: US 15 CENTS PER SHARE DIVIDEND DECLAREDIn September 2019, VEON announced a new dividend policy, which targets paying at least 50% of prior year equity free cash flow after licenses in dividends to shareholders. Dividend payments will always remain subject to review by VEON's Board of Directors, taking into account medium-term investment opportunities and the Group's capital structure. The Group's internal target is to keep Net Debt/EBITDA at around 2.0x (2.4x post-IFRS 16).In line with this dividend policy, VEON's Board of Directors has approved the distribution of a final gross dividend of US 15 cents per share for FY 2019. In calendar year 2020, VEON plans to make this single dividend payment (US 15 cents) with a record date of 27 February 2020. For ordinary shareholders at Euronext Amsterdam, the final dividend of USD 15 cents will be paid in Euros.This final dividend of USD 15 cents per share, together with the USD 13 cents per share declared at the interim period brings the total dividend payment for FY 2019 to USD 28 cents per share, which represents approximately 70% of 2019 equity free cash flow after licenses. We believe this demonstrates the commitment of the company to return cash to shareholders while managing an appropriate level of Net Debt/EBITDA at the Group level.More,Steve-RationallyBullishOn1181,,0,0

3 years ago,Clint,  Telenor is major owner and has already announced it wants to get rid of its stock. It has done so a bit at a time but still holds millions of shares. Big overhead on stock. Second is debt and terrible business holdings left over from Sawiris deal which took stock down from around $18 to $5 or so a few years back. This has been one of my biggest losers run by less than your typical executive (oligarch). Very subject to pump and dump as so many shares controlled internally.

Ask yourself how Algeria EVER could have made sense to Telenor and why did they ditch their share of ownership after the Sawiris deal.

6 years ago,Telenor CFO is making a VERY weird decision! The timing of this sale with even more selling overhang on the market for VIP is totally naive, ill-advised and against interests of their shareholders. Call it what it is - DUMPING! IMHO  Hard to believe they couldn't place their shares with a Verizon or other carrier wanting foreign participation. When the bloodbath is over VIP should be buy of the century assuming they don't make any more Sawiris type deals again. IMHO,Bob,,3,0
