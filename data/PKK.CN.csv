11 hours ago,Just think of all the deals that were made between early Jan - mid Feb. There was a NR almost every single week... Fast forward to now and they have been restricted from releasing material news since March 12 in light of the public offering that has yet to close. It‚Äôs almost been 7 weeks (!!!) now!Use your imagination and think of all the work and the potential deals that would have otherwise been announced during this period and the BACKLOG that will eventually clear. They had already hinted at it in their March progress report using a reference to dominoes. In addition to that, it will soon be end of April when 2020 results are due and soon thereafter Q1 2021.. ü§ØMore,trevorthegreat,,0,0

yesterday,On a positive note, the companies expected strong growth throughout 2021 has had another month to quietly perform. While everyone and their dog is waiting on the PP to close so an uplisting the Nasdaq can take place, over a month has quietly passed by with strong growth taking place. Everyone wants 2020 financials but I‚Äôm more excited about Q1 that is not far away.,Riverfolk,,0,0
yesterday,I did some investigating and spoke to Mark from MZ on the phone yesterday. He said it is not them asking for the delay in news. It's all due to the regulators going over the PP. I spoke to the Ontario regulator and the service line explained that she can't give me any specific information but said it is very normal for there to be several weeks of delays with PPs. We should expect financials by the 30th unless an extension is granted. So everyone sit tight and remember nothing has changed with the company. It's still priced in at the level of Q3 earnings.,James,,0,0

2 days ago,Hellu!  Im here to comfort some impatient people.  A while back I invested in a company which had the same delayes. But for now a lot longer than pkks( pkk has more potential Btw). And people just like here started to ask question and doubt.   Months later after the said date of news - news came and it exploded like crazy.  My point is no matter what happens this week nothing has changed in the company, but time. So be patient.And as we all know our world is rapidly changing for the worse so we cant know for sure whats going on AROUND the company.  But as you should know, this is for the longs and not for the impatient. If you aint ready for the wait, be satisfied with what you got. Cause no investment is a sure thing but atm this is one hell of a ride to stay on.  Either jump of now or know what you own.

6 days ago,Reposting this.. !PEAK FINTECH DUE DILIGENCE AND PRICE TARGET (REPOST)Hi Everyone! I wrote this out weeks ago but wanted to repost it again with corrected numbers since I have seen quite a few people wonder about price targets. Below is my honest effort in coming up with a legitimate price target. There is a lot of chatter about the PP and NASDAQ listing. While those might or might not be good propellants I tried to base my analysis on just the numbers, given currently available information in anticipation of Q4 earnings. PLEASE correct any errors you might see, but I think Peak is CURRENTLY an $8.75 - $12.88 stock trading for $2.95ish and here is why:-Peak's revenue for all of 2019 was $11.7M. In the first quarter of 2020 Peak made $3.9M. Second quarter 2020: $7.26M. Third quarter 2020: $15.1M. So for the first 3 quarters of 2020 Peak made $26.3M (already more than double all of 2019).If Peak simply maintains their Q3 2020 earnings for Q4 2020 then their annual revenue for 2020 will be $41.4M. That means with a BACKWARDS looking revenue multiple of 10x Peak should be valued at a $410M market cap. According to Google the current market cap is $370M. That would mean the current share price should be $3.27 once Q4 gets released (assuming 0 growth for Q4).-Now, let's say they maintain $15M in revenue per quarter for a full year. That would mean $60M in revenue for 2021. At a 10x forward looking multiple the market cap should be approx $600M. That means the share price today should be approx $4.78.-Now, Peak announced a major revenue stream earlier this year. They now have the ability to charge interest on the entirety of their float used to facilitate transactions between their clients at a rate of 2%. The company has not released numbers yet BUT the CEO did say they had approx $1B in funds that traveled through their float in 2019. So if we did a very rough estimate and took the $1B throughout 2019 which resulted in revenue of $11.7M then their float with $60M projected revenue (conservatively) will result in a float of approximately $5.1B for 2021. The 2% fees they will collect will begin halfway through 2021 so 2% of $5.1B for half a year is $51M in revenue. Add that to the $60M then you can estimate 2021 revenue at $110M. At 10x forward revenue we are looking at a $1.1B market cap and share price of $8.75 today. Now, looking forward, I only applied their service fee to half the year as the start date is June. For 2022 they will have a full year of 2% fees- so $102M in revenue from that stream alone and $162M combined resulting in a $12.88 share price.Now, I am sure you noticed something. All of this assumes zero growth. These numbers are just if they MAINTAIN their Q3 2020 revenue while adding their float fee. Yet, as we all know, their revenue is growing at an alarming pace. So add that to the forward looking share price, with a full year of float fees, continued growth of SME lending, growth of their announced partnerships with web retailers and the upcoming NASDAQ listing...well the share price should just go up from there.-Lastly, if NASDAQ investors value the company by estimated 2024 revenue at a higher revenue multiple like they do for most companies- we might be looking at a truly sky high share price this year. I hope that was useful. Please share any thoughts.More,Alex,,0,0

10 days ago,For those looking for comparable companies on the NASDAQ, consider Upstart Holdings (UPST). Upstart is a fintech lending platform operating in the United States, and is thought to be 1-2 years further along than Peak in its business development. With 2021 estimated revenue of $500 million and a market cap of $9.37 billion USD, Upstart‚Äôs price-to-forward earnings ratio sits at 18.74. Peak, with a market cap of only $230 million USD, has a price-to-forward earnings ratio of 2.88, roughly seven times below that of Upstart. Peak‚Äôs combination of powerful growth and undervaluation is precisely what institutional investors on the NASDAQ are looking for. Predicting what a stock will do on any given day is an exercise in futility, but note that UPST climbed 47% on its first day on the NASDAQ (IPO) and has risen roughly 300% since it opened on the exchange in late December 2020.

12 days ago,PEAK FINTECH DUE DILIGENCE AND PRICE TARGET (REPOST)Hi Everyone! I wrote this out weeks ago but wanted to repost it again with corrected numbers since I have seen quite a few people wonder about price targets. Below is my honest effort in coming up with a legitimate price target. There is a lot of chatter about the PP and NASDAQ listing. While those might or might not be good propellants I tried to base my analysis on just the numbers, given currently available information in anticipation of Q4 earnings. PLEASE correct any errors you might see, but I think Peak is CURRENTLY an $8.75 - $12.88 stock trading for $2.95ish and here is why:-Peak's revenue for all of 2019 was $11.7M. In the first quarter of 2020 Peak made $3.9M. Second quarter 2020: $7.26M. Third quarter 2020: $15.1M. So for the first 3 quarters of 2020 Peak made $26.3M (already more than double all of 2019).If Peak simply maintains their Q3 2020 earnings for Q4 2020 then their annual revenue for 2020 will be $41.4M. That means with a BACKWARDS looking revenue multiple of 10x Peak should be valued at a $410M market cap. According to Google the current market cap is $370M. That would mean the current share price should be $3.27 once Q4 gets released (assuming 0 growth for Q4).-Now, let's say they maintain $15M in revenue per quarter for a full year. That would mean $60M in revenue for 2021. At a 10x forward looking multiple the market cap should be approx $600M. That means the share price today should be approx $4.78.-Now, Peak announced a major revenue stream earlier this year. They now have the ability to charge interest on the entirety of their float used to facilitate transactions between their clients at a rate of 2%. The company has not released numbers yet BUT the CEO did say they had approx $1B in funds that traveled through their float in 2019. So if we did a very rough estimate and took the $1B throughout 2019 which resulted in revenue of $11.7M then their float with $60M projected revenue (conservatively) will result in a float of approximately $5.1B for 2021. The 2% fees they will collect will begin halfway through 2021 so 2% of $5.1B for half a year is $51M in revenue. Add that to the $60M then you can estimate 2021 revenue at $110M. At 10x forward revenue we are looking at a $1.1B market cap and share price of $8.75 today. Now, looking forward, I only applied their service fee to half the year as the start date is June. For 2022 they will have a full year of 2% fees- so $102M in revenue from that stream alone and $162M combined resulting in a $12.88 share price.Now, I am sure you noticed something. All of this assumes zero growth. These numbers are just if they MAINTAIN their Q3 2020 revenue while adding their float fee. Yet, as we all know, their revenue is growing at an alarming pace. So add that to the forward looking share price, with a full year of float fees, continued growth of SME lending, growth of their announced partnerships with web retailers and the upcoming NASDAQ listing...well the share price should just go up from there.-Lastly, if NASDAQ investors value the company by estimated 2024 revenue at a higher revenue multiple like they do for most companies- we might be looking at a truly sky high share price this year. I hope that was useful. Please share any thoughts.More,Yohannes,,29,0

last month,Austin make this statement 9 days ago.(5 weeks ago today they filed to be on Nasdaq. According to their estimated timeline we could be uplisted as early as next week up to 3 weeks from now!) If you look at the stock called PYR they are a perfect example of uplisting timing. They just recently listed on Nasdaq and it took about 8 weeks to list from their filing on Dec 22 2020. After they got approval from SEC to list  the SEC wanted the company to give 3 days notice to them before GO DATE. This was so they could put all the pre work needed for listing so it would go smoothly.

2 months ago,@Mark Hi Mark, I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt that you didn't read all the explanations of this all over this board. But you can get listed to the NASDAQ with a $2USD stock price given certain conditions. Peak believes they have met those conditions which is why they have already successfully submitted their application weeks ago. That being said, IF there is any feedback from their application that they need a $3USD stock price, Peak shareholders already approved a reverse share-split which Peak is free to execute whenever it wants. This will easily get Peak up to whatever price is necessary. So whether they need to use that tool or not they are getting on the NASDAQ.More,James,,13,0

I thought everyone would be interested in the very short and direct answer I got...Me: "How confident is Peak in actually getting accepted onto the Nasdaq within the stated time frame?"Cathy Hume: "Very confident."And out of curiosity I asked how many staff Peak has in China. According to Cathy they have about 80!And just for any newbies- aside from the 2 new huge revenue streams they announced so far this year - they appointed Dana Ades-Landy to their board who previously held two positions which I found very interesting. She was Vice-President, Credit Risk and Specialized Products at the National Bank of Canada and the Chair of the audit committee at Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), the CMHC is Canada's largest Crown Corporation with assets in excess of $270B.

It stated that $15.7M was facilitated through the Goldriver platform. Is that the sales revenue Peak generated or just the total value of the transactions? According to Peak's financial statements in Q3 2020 $550M in transactions was conducted through Goldriver for the whole quarter. I want to reconcile the difference between those figures. Thank you for your help."and the response was..."Hello: These numbers were provided to give shareholders additional colour on very recent and new services/partnerships and is by no means including all the other revenue channels PKK has within their subsidiaries. That is why it states ‚Äúselected‚Äù. In other words things are going very very well early this year/quarter!" - Cathy Hume--So just to be clear, the press release is highlighting the EXTRA revenue from NEW STREAMS they are beginning to pull in.

A total of  CAD$15.7MM was financed through the lending hub, which translate into $125MM for the year, which is approximately CAD$3.7MM revenue for 2021 if you take an average 3% as the revenue. Since the first few months are slow months and we can expect that the adoption picks up during the year, so add 4 times to the $3.7MM, then we can expect CAD$15MM for the year.,real,,0,0

2 months ago,Hey Everyone, I wrote this to answer someone who was looking for a run-down on Peak. I'm reposting it here so everyone can see and hopefully it answers questions for anyone wondering what Peak is all about. (All the info below is from their website and CEO interviews/presentations)So Peak is a Canadian company which owns a bunch of subsidiaries that operate in the Chinese commercial lending industry centered around a fintech product called the Cubeler Lending Hub.Here are the basics:1)The lending hub pre-qualifies businesses that are looking for business financing and connects them with banks/lending institutions. When there is a match and a loan is provided Cubeler charges a fee. Imagine it exactly like Tindr but for people looking for money.2)Peak also has the ability to facilitate transactions between factories, manufacturers and small businesses. So let's say you are a pre-qualified business on the Lending Hub. For example, a home builder. You are waiting to buy new lumber but can't afford to buy it until one of your clients pays you. Through the Lending Hub, Peak can now loan you the funds so you can order your lumber. Peak will facilitate the transaction and settle the account once the client pays up.3)Another major recent development is that Peak will now earn daily interest on the funds in its "float". Meaning all the money in Peak's accounts waiting to be sent here and there will earn interest every 24 hours at approx 2% per annum. That will be 2% of billions every year.4)Peak currently operates in 12 cities and is expanding quickly with plans of starting up in India as early as this year.5)Peak is working towards a deal this year with the large e-commerce giants in China to provide their lending hub services through one or more of the e-commerce platforms. It's not guaranteed to happen yet, of course, but the CEO has said that is what they are working towards.6)Peak is uplisting to the NASDAQ in about 5 weeks. The fact that it is not yet on a major exchange is a major reason for why it is so undervalued.7)Their revenue for the first 3 quarters of 2020 has already been more than double all of 2019 and Q4 has not even reported yet.Please correct any mistakes I might have made. Otherwise, looking forward to making money with all of you :).More,James,,30,0

2 months ago,PEAK FINTECH DUE DILIGENCE AND PRICE TARGET.Hi Everyone! I have been investing in Peak for a few weeks (I am at 39k share currently) and I am long on this one. I initially didn't do much research except&nbsp;for some light reading but was really sold by the CEO's presentation on WSR. Well, I suddenly&nbsp;realized how insane it is that I invested so much without doing better research so I decided to figure out a&nbsp;price target given currently available information in anticipation of Q4 earnings. I can't tell you how pleased I am with what I found. Here is the info. PLEASE correct any errors you might see, but I think Peak is currently a $11.35 stock trading for $2.9 and here is why:-Peak's revenue for all of 2019 was $11.7M. In the first quarter of 2020 Peak made $3.9M. Second quarter 2020: $7.26M. Third quarter 2020: $15.1M. So for the first 3 quarters of 2020 Peak made $26.3M (already more than double all of 2019).If Peak simply maintains their Q3 2020 earnings for Q4 2020 then their annual revenue for 2020 will be $41.4M. That means with a BACKWARDS looking revenue multiple of 10x Peak should be valued at a $410M market cap. According to Yahoo Finance the current market cap is $281M. That would mean the current share price should be $4.23 once Q4 gets released (assuming 0 growth for Q4).-Now, let's say they maintain $15M in revenue&nbsp;per quarter for a full year. That would mean $60M in revenue for 2021. At a 10x forward looking multiple the market cap should be approx $600M. That means the share price today should be approx $6.19.-Now, Peak announced a major revenue stream about a month ago. They now have the ability to charge interest on the entirety of their float used to facilitate&nbsp;transactions between their clients at a rate of 2%. The company has not released numbers yet BUT the&nbsp;CEO did say they had approx $1B in funds that traveled through their float in 2019. So if we did a very rough estimate and said that if they held $1B&nbsp;throughout&nbsp;2019 which resulted in revenue of $11.7M then their float will be approximately $5.1B for 2021 with $60M in revenue. The 2% fees they will collect will begin halfway through 2021 so 2% of $5.1B for half a year is $51M in revenue. Add that to the $60M then you can estimate 2021 revenue at $110M. At 10x forward revenue we are looking at a $1.1B market cap and share price of $11.35 today.&nbsp;Now, looking forward, I only applied their service fee to half the year. For 2022 they will have a full year of 2% fees- so $102M in revenue from that stream alone ($162M combined).Now, I am sure you noticed something. All of this assumes zero growth. These numbers are just if they MAINTAIN their Q3 2020 revenue while adding their float fee. Yet, as we all know, their revenue is growing at an alarming pace. So add that to the forward looking share price, with a full year of float fees, continued growth&nbsp;of SME lending, growth of their announced partnerships with web retailers and the upcoming NASDAQ listing...well the share price would just go up from $11.35. -Lastly, if NASDAQ investors value the company by estimated 2024 revenue at a higher revenue multiple like they do for most companies- we might be looking at a truly sky high share price this year.&nbsp;Please give me your thoughts.More,Yohannes,,39,0

(CSE: PKK) (OTCQX: PKKFF) ("Peak" or the "Company"), an innovative Fintech service provider to the Chinese commercial lending sector, today announced that it has successfully tested the process whereby the its Chinese operating subsidiaries will periodically send funds back to Canada once the Company becomes profitable and deems it appropriate for its subsidiaries to do so.Long before establishing its operating subsidiaries in China, Peak worked with business consultants, tax experts, legal and financial advisors specialized in helping foreign entities do business in China. Together they helped Peak create and put in place a corporate structure and file the necessary paperwork so that Peak's subsidiaries could eventually follow a government-established process to send funds to the Company's Canadian head office. Part of the exercise required a disclosure process with various government departments at the time of registration and creation of each subsidiary, and the continuous maintenance in good standing of prescribed regulations, all of which led to the first successful transfer of funds from Peak's Asia Synergy Data Solutions subsidiary to the Company."Today's announcement has been several years in the making," commented Peak CEO Johnson Joseph. "We've been following our advisors' advice from day one and were always confident that the process would work as described. But until recently we weren't in a position to test it or had real grounds to do so. However, given the path that the Company is currently on and the possibility of repatriating funds from China at some point in 2021, we felt it was important for us to test the process to ensure that it actually works. We have now validated that we have a clear path and process, endorsed and prescribed by the Chinese government authorities, for our subsidiaries to send funds from China to Canada. We're also very pleased with the amount we were able to transfer and how quickly the transaction was completed."The amount of the transfer was kept confidential as Peak has adopted an internal policy not to disclose the value of these types of transactions if and when such transactions are referred to in public communications.More,Vincentheim,,14,0

3 months ago,Hi Everyone, I've noticed quite a few people concerned with the possible reverse split and a few inaccurate statements made about it. Just to clear things up- a reverse-split is not a bad thing at all. If someone cuts a large pizza into 8 slices or 12 slices it's still a large pizza. Peak is an extra large pizza. In fact, it's the whole damn pizzeria. So chill. Why are people concerned about a reverse-split generally? Companies that have a share price trajectory going DOWN that have to maintain a minimum price to remain on certain exchanges might reverse split to meet minimum share price requirements. So a reverse split under that circumstance sends the signal that the company is having trouble attracting investors. In PKK's case the current price trajectory is UP, not down. And to speed things up, they are consolidating the shares. What is the net benefit? We will be on the NASDAQ. A Canadian FINTECH company serving the enormous Chinese commercial lending space will get irrational amounts of attention on the NASDAQ. So it's a win-win all around as a result of the reverse split. Context matters. Big money, institutional investors, and those willing to do their DD will know this.More,James,,0,0

3 months ago,A R/S to uplist is quite different than a R/S to maintain price minimum to stay on an exchange. My guidance would be that if you believe in the company then hold or add to your position bc the market doesn‚Äôt always do what you expect.

3 months ago,Hey Everyone! I wanted to get opinions from anyone with thoughts on the following...For context, I'm long on Peak and I love what the company is doing. I currently have 7k shares and want to slowly expand upwards so I'm not trying to bash the stock. I do have one concern though and wanted to get opinions. From what I can tell the Cubeler lending app tried to launch in Canada but didn't get a foothold here at all but instead shifted focus entirely to China. I can't find any real information on what the Chinese app looks like, how users are responding to the experience, and whether it is being well recieved there. The China strategy seems to be working according to the CEO and financials so far but does anyone have concerns with the opaqueness of the business? And does anyone have any informaiton from Chinese language sites about how people are responding to Cubler there?Thanks to anyone who can share info!More,Yohannes,,12,0

3 months ago,For those who don't like someone shorting your stock: Some brokers (TDAm/Schwab and others) actually have your written permission (in the fine print) to let shorts borrow your shares to short the stock against your interest as a long term investor.  TO STOP THIS, make out a "good until canceled" order to sell ALL your shares at some outrageously high price (say, $100/share here).  That way, with a pending "sale", the shorts cannot borrow your stock to short your stock.I am now doing it with all my holdings.Anyone see any downside here?  I'm open to criticism.More,R,,11,0

Is it to attract some MMs which will mean RS and then likely to followup with an offering for the MMs?But then, some who ride this since $0.20 from the 10:1 RS and see it boom 10x said it hasnt failed a bit.So, there is now a dilemma for investors to consider.More,Anonymous,,1,1

3 months ago,What I heard the Johnson Joseph say on Wall Street Reporter was that they intended to eventually list on Nasdaq.  He tended to down play the complexity and time required IMO.  One painful inflection point is that the stock would have to be trading over $4 for up listing to occur.  When I asked about a possible RS, Jack the moderator never addressed the question.  I don‚Äôt think up listing to Nasdaq is anywhere near happening by Q2.  A slow, organic increase in the share price will be necessary before this stock trades beyond the pink sheets  Moreover, it would be helpful if the company comes out with a clear earnings guidance for 21.More,james,,1,6

3 months ago,From the DISCORD, do you own math:"With a fully diluted share count of 150 million, peaks market cap would need to be $15 billion to achieve a $100 share price. Which means that using a modest 10x earnings multiple, Peak would need to be generating $1.5 billion in revenue.Their Q3 earnings per business average with 30,000 businesses and $15 mil in revenue was $500/business. Peak now has around 6 million businesses with access to their lending hub. A 200x increase in potential clients.If Peak maintains their Q3 earnings per business average of $500/business, which actually doesn't seem far fetched, they would be generating $3 billion in revenue. And that number doesn't include data revenue, the social media influencers, or any future deals that have yet to be announced."More,Doug,,27,4

3 months ago,Good morning PKK shareholders. Enjoy the good news. Montreal, Quebec--(Newsfile Corp. - January 18, 2021) - Peak Fintech Group Inc. (CSE: PKK) (OTCQX: PKKFF) ("Peak" or the "Company"), an innovative Fintech service provider to the Chinese commercial lending sector, today announced that it has signed an agreement with China UnionPay subsidiary, Rongbang Technology Ltd. ("Rongbang"), that will give the Company the ability to process payments, settle transactions and transfer funds between lending institutions, banks and the businesses that are part of its Lending Hub ecosystem.Highlights:Peak becomes a transaction aggregator partner for Rongbang and will now be able to control the flow of funds within the Lending Hub ecosystem from start to finish.Peak's clients will have virtual bank accounts within the Lending Hub ecosystem where they can hold cash balances and pay for products and services.Peak will have the ability to debit and credit its clients' real bank accounts held outside of Lending Hub, as well as offer new value-added services, such as escrow services.Any transaction involving the movement of funds will earn Peak a service fee, potentially doubling current transaction fees, earning new fees on loan disbursements and every loan repayment transaction.Peak will earn a 1.5% to 3.0% annual fee on the aggregate value of the funds held in its clients' virtual bank accounts.First transactions expected to be processed in Q2 2021.Rongbang (https://www.masget.com/) provides technology specifically designed to optimize the efficiency of the flow of capital between financial institutions, consumers and businesses operating in a variety of industries. Its "UnionPay Supply Chain Integrated Service Platform", developed in collaboration with China UnionPay (http://www.unionpayintl.com/en/), is used by some of the country's most popular B2B and B2C e-commerce marketplace operators. UnionPay is a State-owned entity and China's largest #$%$ electronic funds transfer network. It's also the only interbank network in China that links all the automatic teller machines (ATMs) of all banks throughout the country. According to Wikipedia, UnionPay is the largest card payment organization (debit and credit cards combined) in the world, ahead of Visa and Mastercard. With today's announced agreement, Peak will have control over the settlement and the transfer of funds of all transactions facilitated by its Lending Hub and Gold River platforms through direct API links to the UnionPay network.More,Eric,,34,4

Usually it takes them a few days of impatience. How do I know it's impatience? Because he keeps talking about 1000% gains overnight. Sign of an impatient person taking a very frustrating loss in a stock. It's so satisfying to see people like this forced into a prison of mental impotence knowing they could never make their money back in the stock that broke them emotionally. This stock broke him. That's why any gains in another stock will never fill the void of failure here. Is that about right, Rick? HeheheMore,Anonymous,,7,1

4 months ago,@ Cdn Eastwood,To answer your question as to how much PKKFF can go to in the next 6 to 12 months, to me it is all depends on where Alibaba and Ant go.  jack Ma made a blunder with the Chinese government.  They are #$%$ off and if he is not able to to smooth out the relationship, they will make an example of him, hence Alibaba and Aunt will lose market share and Aunt may not go public in the short term.  If that scenario plays out, then some tier 2 ecommerce and fintech stock will benefit.  The question then becomes which stocks are the right one.

4 months ago,The level of revenue currently being generated is not presently sufficient to meet the workingcapital requirements. The Company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon itsability to raise additional financing. Even if the Company has been successful in the past in doingso, there is no assurance that it will manage to obtain additional financing in the future. Also, theCompany incurred a net loss of $1,857,471 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 ($1,642,082for 2019), it has an accumulated deficit of $26,096,500 as at September 30, 2020 ($23,623,950 as atDecember 31, 2019) and it has not yet generated positive cash flows from operations on a regular basis. Untilthat happens, the company will continue to assess its working capital needs and undertake whateverinitiative it deems necessary to ensure that it continues to be in a position to meet its financialobligations. These material uncertainties cast significant doubt regarding the Company‚Äôs ability tocontinue as a going concern.More,Link,,0,0

For 2021, equity research is showing $90MM and may be more after any additional partnerships that haven‚Äôt been announced yet. Taking a more reasonable sales multiple of 8x on FY21 sales EV should increase to $720MM or 5.4x. This isn‚Äôt including pending news for the remainder of 2020 or monetizing data which the CEO is planning on doing over the next year or two.

2 years ago,Peak Positioning Technologies Inc.'s Asia Synergy Credit Solutions (ASCS) subsidiary, which provides credit outsourcing services to banks and other financial institutions, has launched a WeChat mini program that allows potential borrowers to quickly see if they would qualify for loans from any of the ASCS lending clients. According to Wikipedia, WeChat counts over 1 billion monthly active users and has been described as China's "app for everything" because of its wide range of functions. In 2017, WeChat launched its Mini Programs to allow companies and developers to create mini-applications to run within WeChat. As of June 2019, WeChat had over 1 million Mini Programs for its users to choose from, from bike-sharing to food delivery and everything in between. To put that in perspective, Apple's App Store has been around since 2008 and had approximately 2.2 million apps listed as of June 2019. Mini Programs have quickly become an integral part of the marketing strategy of virtually every company, large and small, operating in China, including JD.com, Tesla and McDonald's to name just a few (see more on WeChat Mini Programs here: https://wechatwiki.com/wechat-resources/wechat-mini-programs-epic-tutorial-guide/). "With the popularity of WeChat and the explosion of Mini Programs, if you are in business in China and your business cannot be found on WeChat, it's almost as if you are not in business," commented Jiangang Qiu, CEO of ASCS. "Our new WeChat Mini Program will allow us to market our lending clients' services not only directly to potential borrowers, but also to intermediaries whose business is to find these potential borrowers. We see this as an essential marketing and business development tool that should have a considerable positive impact on our operations going forward," Mr. Qiu went on to say.More,cris,,3,0

"We're very pleased to add XinXin to our list of clients," commented Mr. Jiangang Qiu, CEO of ASCS. "It's a great feeling to have our clients recognize our value proposition and the benefits of the Lending Hub System. Every new client we sign up makes it easier to sign the next one, which in turn increases our influence on the commercial lending industry. We are all very excited about what we're in the process of accomplishing through Peak's group of companies," concluded Mr. Qiu.About Peak Positioning Technologies Inc.:Peak Positioning Technologies Inc. is an IT portfolio management company whose mission is to assemble, finance and manage a portfolio of promising companies and assets in some of the fastest-growing tech sectors in China, including fintech, e-commerce and cloud-computing.
