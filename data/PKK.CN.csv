7 hours ago,What I heard the Johnson Joseph say on Wall Street Reporter was that they intended to eventually list on Nasdaq.  He tended to down play the complexity and time required IMO.  One painful inflection point is that the stock would have to be trading over $4 for up listing to occur.  When I asked about a possible RS, Jack the moderator never addressed the question.  I don‚Äôt think up listing to Nasdaq is anywhere near happening by Q2.  A slow, organic increase in the share price will be necessary before this stock trades beyond the pink sheets  Moreover, it would be helpful if the company comes out with a clear earnings guidance for 21.More,james,,0,2

4 days ago,From the DISCORD, do you own math:"With a fully diluted share count of 150 million, peaks market cap would need to be $15 billion to achieve a $100 share price. Which means that using a modest 10x earnings multiple, Peak would need to be generating $1.5 billion in revenue.Their Q3 earnings per business average with 30,000 businesses and $15 mil in revenue was $500/business. Peak now has around 6 million businesses with access to their lending hub. A 200x increase in potential clients.If Peak maintains their Q3 earnings per business average of $500/business, which actually doesn't seem far fetched, they would be generating $3 billion in revenue. And that number doesn't include data revenue, the social media influencers, or any future deals that have yet to be announced."More,Doug,,24,4

7 days ago,Good morning PKK shareholders. Enjoy the good news. Montreal, Quebec--(Newsfile Corp. - January 18, 2021) - Peak Fintech Group Inc. (CSE: PKK) (OTCQX: PKKFF) ("Peak" or the "Company"), an innovative Fintech service provider to the Chinese commercial lending sector, today announced that it has signed an agreement with China UnionPay subsidiary, Rongbang Technology Ltd. ("Rongbang"), that will give the Company the ability to process payments, settle transactions and transfer funds between lending institutions, banks and the businesses that are part of its Lending Hub ecosystem.Highlights:Peak becomes a transaction aggregator partner for Rongbang and will now be able to control the flow of funds within the Lending Hub ecosystem from start to finish.Peak's clients will have virtual bank accounts within the Lending Hub ecosystem where they can hold cash balances and pay for products and services.Peak will have the ability to debit and credit its clients' real bank accounts held outside of Lending Hub, as well as offer new value-added services, such as escrow services.Any transaction involving the movement of funds will earn Peak a service fee, potentially doubling current transaction fees, earning new fees on loan disbursements and every loan repayment transaction.Peak will earn a 1.5% to 3.0% annual fee on the aggregate value of the funds held in its clients' virtual bank accounts.First transactions expected to be processed in Q2 2021.Rongbang (https://www.masget.com/) provides technology specifically designed to optimize the efficiency of the flow of capital between financial institutions, consumers and businesses operating in a variety of industries. Its "UnionPay Supply Chain Integrated Service Platform", developed in collaboration with China UnionPay (http://www.unionpayintl.com/en/), is used by some of the country's most popular B2B and B2C e-commerce marketplace operators. UnionPay is a State-owned entity and China's largest #$%$ electronic funds transfer network. It's also the only interbank network in China that links all the automatic teller machines (ATMs) of all banks throughout the country. According to Wikipedia, UnionPay is the largest card payment organization (debit and credit cards combined) in the world, ahead of Visa and Mastercard. With today's announced agreement, Peak will have control over the settlement and the transfer of funds of all transactions facilitated by its Lending Hub and Gold River platforms through direct API links to the UnionPay network.More,Eric,,34,4

Usually it takes them a few days of impatience. How do I know it's impatience? Because he keeps talking about 1000% gains overnight. Sign of an impatient person taking a very frustrating loss in a stock. It's so satisfying to see people like this forced into a prison of mental impotence knowing they could never make their money back in the stock that broke them emotionally. This stock broke him.

28 days ago,@ Cdn Eastwood,To answer your question as to how much PKKFF can go to in the next 6 to 12 months, to me it is all depends on where Alibaba and Ant go.  jack Ma made a blunder with the Chinese government.  They are #$%$ off and if he is not able to to smooth out the relationship, they will make an example of him, hence Alibaba and Aunt will lose market share and Aunt may not go public in the short term.  If that scenario plays out, then some tier 2 ecommerce and fintech stock will benefit.  The question then becomes which stocks are the right one.  PKKFF is definitely going to be one of the winners in this scenario plays out and $30 within 6 to 12 months is doable.  What other stocks do you see?More,affaire,,4,0

Also, theCompany incurred a net loss of $1,857,471 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 ($1,642,082for 2019), it has an accumulated deficit of $26,096,500 as at September 30, 2020 ($23,623,950 as atDecember 31, 2019) and it has not yet generated positive cash flows from operations on a regular basis.

last month,Peak Longs stay patient friends the selling pressure has been brought on by Warrant expiration as well as shorts taking advantage of the situation and Tax selling. I believe this all starts to subside shortly as warrants expire December 19th.There are several events that will in my opinion move the share price significantly. 1. Warrant selling pressure will churn through by next week 2. Additional new business will be announced by year end3. Company guidance mid January or so expect guidance well above $100 million for 2021 in my opinion.4. NASDAQ up listing application in Q1 most likely by end of January 20215. Q4 Earnings report this may be a blockbuster. They should beat on expectations and if they report margin increase and expense decrease with break even earnings or better look for fireworks.More,L,,21,0
last month,Upstart just IPOd today. It looks like a pretty similar company using software to match bank and borrowers for credit purposes. Except upstart is in the US.

For 2021, equity research is showing $90MM and may be more after any additional partnerships that haven‚Äôt been announced yet. Taking a more reasonable sales multiple of 8x on FY21 sales EV should increase to $720MM or 5.4x. This isn‚Äôt including pending news for the remainder of 2020 or monetizing data which the CEO is planning on doing over the next year or two. This company is set to scale up quickly and has the technology in place to do so. Potential 10x stock in the next 1-2 years if the company continues its recent history of outperformance.More,N2,,17,0

What is it that people are seeing here? What has this company been doing the last 4 years? Given the amount of time that they've spent, how come there is no growth?

The fact that this model can work in China- just means this platform and business model can work anywhere else in the world. China prob one of the most difficult spaces to operate as private business- model will be proven and replicated else where with ease. Crazy to say that if they just operated in China it would be enough money anyways. Extremely bullish. -,buraa,,10,0

2 months ago,Good morning! Remember Peak is at their inflection point. The point where they will start exploding and scaling at a rapid pace. Its already happening wit the BDC deal  potentially doubling their ecosystem with one deal. Think about the revenue potential with that one deal not to mention the whole city's they are incorporating into the ecosystem. No longer a matter of if but only when. Personally loading up one last time under a $1.00 i believe the next leg is coming. GLTA,Ben G,,12,0

2 months ago,Peak longsI'm summarizing the CEO's last interview on Wall St Reporter. Remember CEO's are programmed to under promise and over deliver if they want strong shareholder support. In the interview CEO Joseph stated the catalysts we need to look for coming soon :1. Look for a release stating the first transaction from the BDC  deal. This has been completed.2. Look for another deal signed before the end of the year similar to the BDC deal.3. The newest financial center coming online by end of year.4. This is the most interesting comment, he said they need the share price to rise to $4-5.00 per share to be eligible to apply for listing on the Nasdaq. He then stated he thinks they will be able to apply for listing by the end of the year or the first QTR 2021. So with that said he must believe the share price will be $4-5.00 by end of year or first qtr 2021. There is great reason to be bullish here.

last year,Peak Positioning Technologies Inc.'s Asia Synergy Credit Solutions (ASCS) subsidiary, which provides credit outsourcing services to banks and other financial institutions, has launched a WeChat mini program that allows potential borrowers to quickly see if they would qualify for loans from any of the ASCS lending clients. According to Wikipedia, WeChat counts over 1 billion monthly active users and has been described as China's "app for everything" because of its wide range of functions. In 2017, WeChat launched its Mini Programs to allow companies and developers to create mini-applications to run within WeChat. As of June 2019, WeChat had over 1 million Mini Programs for its users to choose from, from bike-sharing to food delivery and everything in between. To put that in perspective, Apple's App Store has been around since 2008 and had approximately 2.2 million apps listed as of June 2019. Mini Programs have quickly become an integral part of the marketing strategy of virtually every company, large and small, operating in China, including JD.com, Tesla and McDonald's to name just a few (see more on WeChat Mini Programs here: https://wechatwiki.com/wechat-resources/wechat-mini-programs-epic-tutorial-guide/). "With the popularity of WeChat and the explosion of Mini Programs, if you are in business in China and your business cannot be found on WeChat, it's almost as if you are not in business," commented Jiangang Qiu, CEO of ASCS. "Our new WeChat Mini Program will allow us to market our lending clients' services not only directly to potential borrowers, but also to intermediaries whose business is to find these potential borrowers. We see this as an essential marketing and business development tool that should have a considerable positive impact on our operations going forward," Mr. Qiu went on to say.More,cris,,3,0
