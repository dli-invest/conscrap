4 days ago,Ahh it looks like Rick took a nasty loss here recently. From the looks of it he started posted a few days after the price dropped from $1.65 and didn't bounce back up. Usually it takes them a few days of impatience. How do I know it's impatience? Because he keeps talking about 1000% gains overnight. Sign of an impatient person taking a very frustrating loss in a stock. It's so satisfying to see people like this forced into a prison of mental impotence knowing they could never make their money back in the stock that broke them emotionally. This stock broke him. That's why any gains in another stock will never fill the void of failure here. Is that about right, Rick? HeheheMore,Anonymous,7,1

12 days ago,Peak issued a press release on Dec. 21, 2020 about a partnership with Pinduoduo. The press release should have been approved by Pinduoduo before its release. However, internal confusion within Peak led Peak to issue the press release without first obtaining Pinduoduo‚Äôs consent. Peak has therefore taken down the press release at Pinduoduo‚Äôs request. Peak apologises for any confusion this has caused and will first obtain Pinduoduo‚Äôs consent prior to issuing any communication in the future referencing Pinduoduo.,Far,3,2

20 days ago,@ Cdn Eastwood,To answer your question as to how much PKKFF can go to in the next 6 to 12 months, to me it is all depends on where Alibaba and Ant go.  jack Ma made a blunder with the Chinese government.  They are #$%$ off and if he is not able to to smooth out the relationship, they will make an example of him, hence Alibaba and Aunt will lose market share and Aunt may not go public in the short term.  If that scenario plays out, then some tier 2 ecommerce and fintech stock will benefit.  The question then becomes which stocks are the right one.  PKKFF is definitely going to be one of the winners in this scenario plays out and $30 within 6 to 12 months is doable.  What other stocks do you see?More,affaire,4,0

Also, its average market capitalization over the prior 12 months must be at least $550 million, and revenues in the previous fiscal year must be $110 million, minimum.Standard No. 3: Capitalization With RevenueCompanies can be removed from the cash flow requirement of the second standard if its average market capitalization over the past 12 months is at least $850 million and revenues over the prior fiscal year are at least $90 million.Standard No. 4: Assets With EquityCompanies can eliminate the cash flow and revenue requirements, and decrease its marketing capitalization requirements to $160 million if their total assets total at least $80 million and their stockholders' equity is at least $55 million.It looks like we are closest to standard #4 with a minimum bid of $2 as long as it meets varying requirements for example having at least 2 market makers on board.More,Anonymous,8,1

27 days ago,The level of revenue currently being generated is not presently sufficient to meet the workingcapital requirements. The Company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon itsability to raise additional financing. Even if the Company has been successful in the past in doingso, there is no assurance that it will manage to obtain additional financing in the future. Also, theCompany incurred a net loss of $1,857,471 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 ($1,642,082for 2019), it has an accumulated deficit of $26,096,500 as at September 30, 2020 ($23,623,950 as atDecember 31, 2019) and it has not yet generated positive cash flows from operations on a regular basis. Untilthat happens, the company will continue to assess its working capital needs and undertake whateverinitiative it deems necessary to ensure that it continues to be in a position to meet its financialobligations. These material uncertainties cast significant doubt regarding the Company‚Äôs ability tocontinue as a going concern.More,Link,0,0

Warrant selling pressure will churn through by next week 2. Additional new business will be announced by year end3. Company guidance mid January or so expect guidance well above $100 million for 2021 in my opinion.4. NASDAQ up listing application in Q1 most likely by end of January 20215.

For 2021, equity research is showing $90MM and may be more after any additional partnerships that haven‚Äôt been announced yet. Taking a more reasonable sales multiple of 8x on FY21 sales EV should increase to $720MM or 5.4x. This isn‚Äôt including pending news for the remainder of 2020 or monetizing data which the CEO is planning on doing over the next year or two.

2 months ago,Good morning! Remember Peak is at their inflection point. The point where they will start exploding and scaling at a rapid pace. Its already happening wit the BDC deal  potentially doubling their ecosystem with one deal. Think about the revenue potential with that one deal not to mention the whole city's they are incorporating into the ecosystem. No longer a matter of if but only when.

2 months ago,Peak longsI'm summarizing the CEO's last interview on Wall St Reporter. Remember CEO's are programmed to under promise and over deliver if they want strong shareholder support. In the interview CEO Joseph stated the catalysts we need to look for coming soon :1. Look for a release stating the first transaction from the BDC  deal. This has been completed.2. Look for another deal signed before the end of the year similar to the BDC deal.3. The newest financial center coming online by end of year.4. This is the most interesting comment, he said they need the share price to rise to $4-5.00 per share to be eligible to apply for listing on the Nasdaq. He then stated he thinks they will be able to apply for listing by the end of the year or the first QTR 2021. So with that said he must believe the share price will be $4-5.00 by end of year or first qtr 2021. There is great reason to be bullish here.

last year,Peak Positioning Technologies Inc.'s Asia Synergy Credit Solutions (ASCS) subsidiary, which provides credit outsourcing services to banks and other financial institutions, has launched a WeChat mini program that allows potential borrowers to quickly see if they would qualify for loans from any of the ASCS lending clients. According to Wikipedia, WeChat counts over 1 billion monthly active users and has been described as China's "app for everything" because of its wide range of functions. In 2017, WeChat launched its Mini Programs to allow companies and developers to create mini-applications to run within WeChat. As of June 2019, WeChat had over 1 million Mini Programs for its users to choose from, from bike-sharing to food delivery and everything in between. To put that in perspective, Apple's App Store has been around since 2008 and had approximately 2.2 million apps listed as of June 2019. Mini Programs have quickly become an integral part of the marketing strategy of virtually every company, large and small, operating in China, including JD.com, Tesla and McDonald's to name just a few (see more on WeChat Mini Programs here: https://wechatwiki.com/wechat-resources/wechat-mini-programs-epic-tutorial-guide/). "With the popularity of WeChat and the explosion of Mini Programs, if you are in business in China and your business cannot be found on WeChat, it's almost as if you are not in business," commented Jiangang Qiu, CEO of ASCS. "Our new WeChat Mini Program will allow us to market our lending clients' services not only directly to potential borrowers, but also to intermediaries whose business is to find these potential borrowers. We see this as an essential marketing and business development tool that should have a considerable positive impact on our operations going forward," Mr. Qiu went on to say.More,cris,3,0

"We're very pleased to add XinXin to our list of clients," commented Mr. Jiangang Qiu, CEO of ASCS. "It's a great feeling to have our clients recognize our value proposition and the benefits of the Lending Hub System. Every new client we sign up makes it easier to sign the next one, which in turn increases our influence on the commercial lending industry. We are all very excited about what we're in the process of accomplishing through Peak's group of companies," concluded Mr. Qiu.About Peak Positioning Technologies Inc.:Peak Positioning Technologies Inc. is an IT portfolio management company whose mission is to assemble, finance and manage a portfolio of promising companies and assets in some of the fastest-growing tech sectors in China, including fintech, e-commerce and cloud-computing.
